`` Leave the Picts alone , '' I say .
`` Stop the heather-burning at once , and -- they be improvident little animal -- send them a shipload or two of corn now and then . '' '
`` Their own men must distribute it -- not some cheat Greek accountant , '' say Pertinax . '
`` Yes , and allow them to come to our hospital when they be sick , '' I say . '
`` Surely they would die first , '' say Maximus . '
`` Not if Parnesius bring them in , '' say Allo .
`` I could show you twenty wolf-bitten , bear-clawed Picts within twenty mile of here .
But Parnesius must stay with them in hospital , else they would go mad with fear . '' '
`` I see , '' say Maximus .
`` Like everything else in the world , it be one man 's work .
You , I think , be that one man . '' '
`` Pertinax and I be one , '' I say . '
`` As you please , so long a you work .
Now , Allo , you know that I mean your people no harm .
Leave u to talk together , '' say Maximus . '
`` No need ! ''
say Allo .
`` I be the corn between the upper and low millstone .
I must know what the low millstone mean to do .
These boy have speak the truth as far a they know it .
I , a Prince , will tell you the rest .
I be troubled about the Men of the North . ''
He squat like a hare in the heather , and look over his shoulder . '
`` I also , '' say Maximus , `` or I should not be here . '' '
`` Listen , '' say Allo .
`` Long and long ago the Winged Hats '' -- he mean the Northmen -- `` come to our beach and say , ` Rome fall !
Push her down ! '
We fight you .
You send men .
We be beat .
After that we say to the Winged Hats , ` You be liar !
Make our men alive that Rome kill , and we will believe you . '
They go away ashamed .
Now they come back bold , and they tell the old tale , which we begin to believe -- that Rome fall ! '' '
`` Give me three year ' peace on the Wall , '' cry Maximus , `` and I will show you and all the raven how they lie ! '' '
`` Ah , I wish it too !
I wish to save what be leave of the corn from the millstone .
But you shoot u Picts when we come to borrow a little iron from the Iron Ditch ; you burn our heather , which be all our crop ; you trouble u with your great catapult .
Then you hide behind the Wall , and scorch u with Greek fire .
How can I keep my young men from listen to the Winged Hats -- in winter especially , when we be hungry ?
My young men will say , ` Rome can neither fight nor rule .
She be take her men out of Britain .
The Winged Hats will help u to push down the Wall .
Let u show them the secret road across the bog . '
Do I want that ?
No ! ''
He spat like an adder .
`` I would keep the secret of my people though I be burn alive .
My two child here have speak truth .
Leave u Picts alone .
Comfort u , and cherish u , and fee u from far off -- with the hand behind the back .
Parnesius understand u .
Let him have rule on the Wall , and I will hold my young men quiet for '' -- he tick it off on his finger -- `` one year easily : the next year not so easily : the third year , perhaps !
See , I give you three year .
If then you do not show u that Rome be strong in men and terrible in arm , the Winged Hats , I tell you , will sweep down the Wall from either sea till they meet in the middle , and you will go .
I shall not grieve over that , but well I know tribe never help tribe except for one price .
We Picts will go too .
The Winged Hats will grind u to this ! ''
He toss a handful of dust in the air . '
`` Oh , Roma Dea ! ''
say Maximus , half aloud .
`` It be always one man 's work -- always and everywhere ! ''
`` And one man 's life , '' say Allo .
`` You be Emperor , but not a God .
You may die . '' '
`` I have think of that too , '' say he .
`` Very good .
If this wind hold , I shall be at the East end of the Wall by morning .
To-morrow , then , I shall see you two when I inspect , and I will make you Captains of the Wall for this work . '' '
`` One instant , Cæsar , '' say Pertinax .
`` All men have their price .
I be not buy yet . '' '
`` Do you also begin to bargain so early ? ''
say Maximus .
`` Well ? '' '
`` Give me justice against my uncle Icenus , the Duumvir of Divio in Gaul , '' he say . '
`` Only a life ?
I think it would be money or an office .
Certainly you shall have him .
Write his name on these tablet -- on the red side ; the other be for the living ! ''
and Maximus hold out his tablet . '
`` He be of no use to me dead , '' say Pertinax .
`` My mother be a widow .
I be far off .
I be not sure he pay her all her dowry . '' '
`` No matter .
My arm be reasonably long .
We will look through your uncle 's account in due time .
Now , farewell till to-morrow , O Captains of the Wall ! ''
` We saw him grow small across the heather a he walk to the galley .
There be Picts , score , each side of him , hide behind stone .
He never look leave or right .
He sail away southerly , full spread before the evening breeze , and when we have watch him out to sea , we be silent .
We understand that Earth breed few men like to this man .
` Presently Allo bring the pony and hold them for u to mount -- a thing he have never do before . '
`` Wait awhile , '' say Pertinax , and he make a little altar of cut turf , and strew heather-bloom atop , and lay upon it a letter from a girl in Gaul . '
`` What do you do , O my friend ? ''
I say . '
`` I sacrifice to my dead youth , '' he answer , and , when the flame have consume the letter , he grind them out with his heel .
Then we ride back to that Wall of which we be to be Captains . '
Parnesius stop .
The child sit still , not even ask if that be all the tale .
Puck beckon , and point the way out of the wood .
` Sorry , ' he whisper , ` but you must go now . '
` We have n't make him angry , have we ? '
say Una .
` He look so far off , and -- and -- thinky . '
` Bless your heart , no .
Wait till tomorrow .
It wo n't be long .
Remember , you 've be play Lays of Ancient Rome . '
And as soon a they have scramble through their gap where Oak , Ash , and Thorn grow , that be all they remember .
A SONG TO MITHRAS Mithras , God of the Morning , our trumpet waken the Wall !
` Rome be above the Nations , but Thou art over all ! '
Now a the name be answer , and the guard be march away , Mithras , also a soldier , give u strength for the day !
Mithras , God of the Noontide , the heather swim in the heat , Our helmet scorch our forehead , our sandal burn our foot .
Now in the ungirt hour ; now ere we blink and drowse , Mithras , also a soldier , keep u true to our vow !
Mithras , God of the Sunset , low on the Western main , Thou descend immortal , immortal to rise again !
Now when the watch be end , now when the wine be draw , Mithras , also a soldier , keep u pure till the dawn !
Mithras , God of the Midnight , here where the great bull dy , Look on Thy child in darkness .
Oh , take our sacrifice !
Many road Thou hast fashion : all of them lead to the Light !
Mithras , also a soldier , teach u to die aright !
THE WINGED HATS The next day happen to be what they call a Wild Afternoon .
Father and Mother go out to pay call ; Miss Blake go for a ride on her bicycle , and they be leave all alone till eight o'clock .
When they have see their dear parent and their dear preceptress politely off the premise they get a cabbage-leaf full of raspberry from the gardener , and a Wild Tea from Ellen .
They eat the raspberry to prevent their squashing , and they mean to divide the cabbage-leaf with Three Cows down at the Theatre , but they come across a dead hedgehog which they simply have to bury , and the leaf be too useful to waste .
Then they go on to the Forge and find old Hobden the hedger at home with his son , the Bee Boy , who be not quite right in his head , but who can pick up swarm of bee in his naked hand ; and the Bee Boy tell them the rhyme about the slow-worm : -- ` If I have eye a I could see , No mortal man would trouble me . '
They all have tea together by the hive , and Hobden say the loaf-cake which Ellen have give them be almost as good a what his wife use to make , and he show them how to set a wire at the right height for hare .
They know about rabbit already .
Then they climb up Long Ditch into the low end of Far Wood .
This be sad and dark than the Volaterrae end because of an old marlpit full of black water , where weepy , hairy moss hang round the stump of the willow and alder .
But the bird come to perch on the dead branch , and Hobden say that the bitter willow-water be a sort of medicine for sick animal .
They sit down on a felled oak-trunk in the shadow of the beech undergrowth , and be loop the wire Hobden have give them , when they saw Parnesius .
` How quietly you come ! '
say Una , move up to make room .
` Where 's Puck ? '
` The Faun and I have dispute whether it be well that I should tell you all my tale , or leave it untold , ' he reply . '
I only say that if he tell it a it happen you would n't understand it , ' say Puck , jump up like a squirrel from behind the log . '
I do n't understand all of it , ' say Una , ` but I like hear about the little Picts . '
` What I ca n't understand , ' say Dan , ` be how Maximus know all about the Picts when he be over in Gaul . '
` He who make himself Emperor anywhere must know everything , everywhere , ' say Parnesius .
` We have this much from Maximus 's mouth after the Games . '
` Games ?
What Games ? '
say Dan .
Parnesius stretch his arm out stiffly , thumb point to the ground .
` Gladiators !
That sort of game , ' he say .
` There be two day ' Games in his honour when he land all unexpected at Segedunum on the East end of the Wall .
Yes , the day after we have meet him we hold two day ' Games ; but I think the great risk be run , not by the poor wretch on the sand , but by Maximus .
In the old day the Legions keep silence before their Emperor .
So do not we !
You could hear the solid roar run West along the Wall a his chair be carry rock through the crowd .
The garrison beat round him -- clamouring , clown , ask for pay , for change of quarter , for anything that come into their wild head .
That chair be like a little boat among wave , dip and fall , but always rise again after one have shut the eye . '
Parnesius shiver .
` Were they angry with him ? '
say Dan .
` No more angry than wolf in a cage when their trainer walk among them .
If he have turn his back an instant , or for an instant have cease to hold their eye , there would have be another Emperor make on the Wall that hour .
Was it not so , Faun ? '
` So it be .
So it always will be , ' say Puck .
` Late in the even his messenger come for u , and we follow to the Temple of Victory , where he lodge with Rutilianus , the General of the Wall .
I have hardly see the General before , but he always give me leave when I wish to take Heather .
He be a great glutton , and keep five Asian cook , and he come of a family that believe in oracle .
We could smell his good dinner when we enter , but the table be empty .
He lay snort on a couch .
Maximus sit apart among long roll of account .
Then the door be shut . '
`` These be your men , '' say Maximus to the General , who prop his eye-corners open with his gouty finger , and star at u like a fish . '
`` I shall know them again , Cæsar , '' say Rutilianus .
`` Very good , '' say Maximus .
`` Now hear !
You be not to move man or shield on the Wall except a these boy shall tell you .
You will do nothing , except eat , without their permission .
They be the head and arm .
You be the belly ! '' '
`` As Cæsar please , '' the old man grunt .
`` If my pay and profit be not cut , you may make my Ancestors ' Oracle my master .
Rome have be !
Rome have be ! ''
Then he turn on his side to sleep . '
`` He have it , '' say Maximus .
`` We will get to what I need . ''
` He unroll full copy of the number of men and supply on the Wall -- down to the sick that very day in Hunno Hospital .
Oh , but I groan when his pen mark off detachment after detachment of our best -- of our least worthless men !
He take two tower of our Scythians , two of our North British auxiliary , two Numidian cohort , the Dacians all , and half the Belgians .
It be like an eagle peck a carcass . '
`` And now , how many catapult have you ? ''
He turn up a new list , but Pertinax lay his open hand there . '
`` No , Cæsar , '' say he .
`` Do not tempt the Gods too far .
Take men , or engine , but not both ; else we refuse . '' '
` Engines ? '
say Una .
` The catapult of the Wall -- huge thing forty foot high to the head -- fire net of raw stone or forge bolt .
Nothing can stand against them .
He leave u our catapult at last , but he take a Cæsar 's half of our men without pity .
We be a shell when he roll up the list ! '
`` Hail , Cæsar !
We , about to die , salute you ! ''
say Pertinax , laugh .
`` If any enemy even lean against the Wall now , it will tumble . '' '
`` Give me the three year Allo spoke of , '' he answer , `` and you shall have twenty thousand men of your own choosing up here .
But now it be a gamble -- a game play against the Gods , and the stake be Britain , Gaul , and perhaps Rome .
You play on my side ? '' '
`` We will play , Cæsar , '' I say , for I have never meet a man like this man . '
`` Good .
Tomorrow , '' say he , `` I proclaim you Captains of the Wall before the troop . ''
` So we go into the moonlight , where they be clean the ground after the Games .
We saw great Roma Dea atop of the Wall , the frost on her helmet , and her spear point towards the North Star .
We saw the twinkle of night-fires all along the guard tower , and the line of the black catapult grow small and small in the distance .
All these thing we know till we be weary ; but that night they seem very strange to u , because the next day we know we be to be their master .
` The men take the news well ; but when Maximus go away with half our strength , and we have to spread ourselves into the emptied tower , and the townspeople complain that trade would be ruin , and the autumn gales blew -- it be dark day for u two .
Here Pertinax be more than my right hand .
Being bear and breed among the great country-houses in Gaul , he know the proper word to address to all -- from Roman-born Centurions to those dog of the Third -- the Libyans .
And he speak to each a though that man be as high-minded a himself .
Now I saw so strongly what thing be need to be do , that I forget thing be only accomplish by mean of men .
That be a mistake . '
I fear nothing from the Picts , at least for that year , but Allo warn me that the Winged Hats would soon come in from the sea at each end of the Wall to prove to the Picts how weak we be .
So I make ready in haste , and none too soon .
I shift our best men to the end of the Wall , and set up screened catapult by the beach .
The Winged Hats would drive in before the snow-squalls -- ten or twenty boat at a time -- on Segedunum or Ituna , accord a the wind blew .
` Now a ship come in to land men must furl her sail .
If you wait till you see her men gather up the sail 's foot , your catapult can jerk a net of loose stone -LRB- bolt only cut through the cloth -RRB- into the bag of it .
Then she turn over , and the sea make everything clean again .
A few men may come ashore , but very few .
... It be not hard work , except the wait on the beach in blow sand and snow .
And that be how we deal with the Winged Hats that winter .
` Early in the spring , when the East wind blow like skinning-knives , they gather again off Segedunum with many ship .
Allo tell me they would never rest till they have take a tower in open fight .
Certainly they fight in the open .
We deal with them thoroughly through a long day : and when all be finish , one man dive clear of the wreckage of his ship , and swam towards shore .
I wait , and a wave tumble him at my foot .
` As I stoop , I saw he wear such a medal a I wear . '
Parnesius raise his hand to his neck .
` Therefore , when he could speak , I address him a certain Question which can only be answer in a certain manner .
He answer with the necessary Word -- the Word that belong to the Degree of Gryphons in the science of Mithras my God .
I put my shield over him till he could stand up .
You see I be not short , but he be a head taller than I .
He say : `` What now ? ''
I say : `` At your pleasure , my brother , to stay or go . ''
` He look out across the surf .
There remain one ship unhurt , beyond range of our catapult .
I check the catapult and he wave her in .
She come a a hound come to a master .
When she be yet a hundred pace from the beach , he fling back his hair , and swim out .
They haul him in , and go away .
I know that those who worship Mithras be many and of all race , so I do not think much more upon the matter . '
A month later I saw Allo with his horse -- by the Temple of Pan , O Faun -- and he give me a great necklace of gold stud with coral .
` At first I think it be a bribe from some tradesman in the town -- meant for old Rutilianus .
`` Nay , '' say Allo .
`` This be a gift from Amal , that Winged Hat whom you save on the beach .
He say you be a Man . '' '
`` He be a Man , too .
Tell him I can wear his gift , '' I answer . '
`` Oh , Amal be a young fool ; but , speak a sensible men , your Emperor be do such great thing in Gaul that the Winged Hats be anxious to be his friend , or , good still , the friend of his servant .
They think you and Pertinax could lead them to victory . ''
Allo look at me like a one-eyed raven . '
`` Allo , '' I say , `` you be the corn between the two millstone .
Be content if they grind evenly , and do n't thrust your hand between them . '' '
`` I ? ''
say Allo .
`` I hate Rome and the Winged Hats equally ; but if the Winged Hats think that some day you and Pertinax might join them against Maximus , they would leave you in peace while you consider .
Time be what we need -- you and I and Maximus .
Let me carry a pleasant message back to the Winged Hats -- something for them to make a council over .
We barbarian be all alike .
We sit up half the night to discuss anything a Roman say .
Eh ? '' '
`` We have no men .
We must fight with word , '' say Pertinax .
`` Leave it to Allo and me . ''
` So Allo carry word back to the Winged Hats that we would not fight them if they do not fight u ; and they -LRB- I think they be a little tired of lose men in the sea -RRB- agree to a sort of truce .
I believe Allo , who be a horse-dealer loved lie , also tell them we might some day rise against Maximus a Maximus have rise against Rome .
` Indeed , they permit the corn-ships which I send to the Picts to pass North that season without harm .
Therefore the Picts be well feed that winter , and since they be in some sort my child , I be glad of it .
We have only two thousand men on the Wall , and I write many time to Maximus and beg -- pray -- him to send me only one cohort of my old North British troop .
He could not spare them .
He need them to win more victory in Gaul .
` Then come news that he have defeat and slay the Emperor Gratian , and think he must now be secure , I write again for men .
He answer : `` You will learn that I have at last settled account with the pup Gratian .
There be no need that he should have die , but he become confused and lose his head , which be a bad thing to befall any Emperor .
Tell your Father I be content to drive two mule only ; for unless my old General 's son think himself destine to destroy me , I shall rest Emperor of Gaul and Britain , and then you , my two child , will presently get all the men you need .
Just now I can spare none . '' '
` What do he mean by his General 's son ? '
say Dan .
` He mean Theodosius Emperor of Rome , who be the son of Theodosius the General under whom Maximus have fight in the old Pict War .
The two men never love each other , and when Gratian make the young Theodosius Emperor of the East -LRB- at least , so I 've hear -RRB- , Maximus carry on the war to the second generation .
It be his fate , and it be his fall .
But Theodosius the Emperor be a good man .
As I know . '
Parnesius be silent for a moment and then continue . '
I write back to Maximus that , though we have peace on the Wall , I should be happy with a few more men and some new catapult .
He answer : `` You must live a little long under the shadow of my victory , till I can see what young Theodosius intend .
He may welcome me a a brother-Emperor , or he may be prepare an army .
In either case I can not spare men just now . ''
` But he be always say that , ' cry Una .
` It be true .
He do not make excuse ; but thanks , a he say , to the news of his victory , we have no trouble on the Wall for a long , long time .
The Picts grow fat a their own sheep among the heather , and a many of my men a live be well exercise in their weapon .
Yes , the Wall look strong .
For myself , I know how weak we be .
I know that if even a false rumour of any defeat to Maximus break loose among the Winged Hats , they might come down in earnest , and then -- the Wall must go !
For the Picts I never care , but in those year I learn something of the strength of the Winged Hats .
They increase their strength every day , but I could not increase my men .
Maximus have empty Britain behind u , and I felt myself to be a man with a rotten stick standing before a broken fence to turn bull .
` Thus , my friend , we live on the Wall , wait -- wait -- wait for the men that Maximus never send .
` Presently he write that he be prepare an army against Theodosius .
He write -- and Pertinax read it over my shoulder in our quarter : '' Tell your Father that my destiny order me to drive three mule or be tear in piece by them .
I hope within a year to finish with Theodosius , son of Theodosius , once and for all .
Then you shall have Britain to rule , and Pertinax , if he choose , Gaul .
To-day I wish strongly you be with me to beat my Auxiliaries into shape .
Do not , I pray you , believe any rumour of my sickness .
I have a little evil in my old body which I shall cure by rid swiftly into Rome .
'' ` Said Pertinax : `` It be finish with Maximus .
He write a a man without hope .
I , a man without hope , can see this .
What do he add at the bottom of the roll ? '
Tell Pertinax I have meet his late Uncle , the Duumvir of Divio , and that he account to me quite truthfully for all his Mother 's monies .
I have send her with a fitting escort , for she be the mother of a hero , to Nicaea , where the climate be warm . ' '
`` That be proof , '' say Pertinax .
`` Nicaea be not far by sea from Rome .
A woman there could take ship and fly to Rome in time of war .
Yes , Maximus foresee his death , and be fulfil his promise one by one .
But I be glad my uncle meet him . '' ' '
`` You think blackly to-day ? ''
I ask . '
`` I think truth .
The Gods weary of the play we have play against them .
Theodosius will destroy Maximus .
It be finish ! '' '
`` Will you write him that ? ''
I say . '
`` See what I shall write , '' he answer , and he take pen and write a letter cheerful a the light of day , tender a a woman 's and full of jest .
Even I , read over his shoulder , take comfort from it till -- I saw his face ! '
`` And now , '' he say , seal it , `` we be two dead men , my brother .
Let u go to the Temple . ''
` We pray awhile to Mithras , where we have many time pray before .
After that , we live day by day among evil rumour till winter come again .
` It happen one morning that we ride to the East shore , and find on the beach a fair-haired man , half frozen , bound to some broken plank .
Turning him over , we saw by his belt-buckle that he be a Goth of an Eastern Legion .
Suddenly he open his eye and cry loudly , `` He be dead !
The letter be with me , but the Winged Hats sink the ship . ''
So say , he die between our hand .
` We ask not who be dead .
We know !
We race before the driving snow to Hunno , think perhaps Allo might be there .
We find him already at our stable , and he saw by our face what we have hear . '
`` It be in a tent by the sea , '' he stammer .
`` He be behead by Theodosius .
He send a letter to you , write while he wait to be slay .
The Winged Hats meet the ship and take it .
The news be run through the heather like fire .
Blame me not !
I can not hold back my young men any more . '' '
`` I would we could say a much for our men , '' say Pertinax , laugh .
`` But , Gods be praise , they can not run away . '' '
`` What do you do ? ''
say Allo .
`` I bring an order -- a message -- from the Winged Hats that you join them with your men , and march South to plunder Britain . '' '
`` It grieve me , '' say Pertinax , `` but we be station here to stop that thing . '' '
`` If I carry back such an answer they will kill me , '' say Allo .
`` I always promise the Winged Hats that you would rise when Maximus fell .
I -- I do not think he could fall . '' '
`` Alas !
my poor barbarian , '' say Pertinax , still laugh .
`` Well , you have sell u too many good pony to be throw back to your friend .
We will make you a prisoner , although you be an ambassador . '' '
`` Yes , that will be best , '' say Allo , hold out a halter .
We bind him lightly , for he be an old man . '
`` Presently the Winged Hats may come to look for you , and that will give u more time .
See how the habit of play for time stick to a man ! ''
say Pertinax , a he tie the rope . '
`` No , '' I say .
`` Time may help .
If Maximus write u a letter while he be a prisoner , Theodosius must have send the ship that bring it .
If he can send ship , he can send men . '' '
`` How will that profit u ? ''
say Pertinax .
`` We serve Maximus , not Theodosius .
Even if by some miracle of the Gods Theodosius down South send and save the Wall , we could not expect more than the death Maximus die . '' '
`` It concern u to defend the Wall , no matter what Emperor die , or make die , '' I say . '
`` That be worthy of your brother the philosopher , '' say Pertinax .
`` Myself I be without hope , so I do not say solemn and stupid thing !
Rouse the Wall ! ''
` We arm the Wall from end to end ; we tell the officer that there be a rumour of Maximus 's death which might bring down the Winged Hats , but we be sure , even if it be true , that Theodosius , for the sake of Britain , would send u help .
Therefore , we must stand fast .
... My friend , it be above all thing strange to see how men bear ill news !
Often the strong till then become the weak , while the weak , a it be , reach up and steal strength from the Gods .
So it be with u .
Yet my Pertinax by his jest and his courtesy and his labour have put heart and training into our poor number during the past year -- more than I should have think possible .
Even our Libyan Cohort -- the Third -- stand up in their padded cuirass and do not whimper .
` In three day come seven chief and elder of the Winged Hats .
Among them be that tall young man , Amal , whom I have meet on the beach , and he smile when he saw my necklace .
We make them welcome , for they be ambassador .
We show them Allo , alive but bound .
They think we have kill him , and I saw it would not have vex them if we have .
Allo saw it too , and it vex him .
Then in our quarter at Hunno we come to Council .
` They say that Rome be fall , and that we must join them .
They offer me all South Britain to govern after they have take a tribute out of it . '
I answer , `` Patience .
This Wall be not weigh off like plunder .
Give me proof that my General be dead . '' '
`` Nay , '' say one elder , `` prove to u that he live '' ; and another say cunningly , `` What will you give u if we read you his last word ? '' '
`` We be not merchant to bargain , '' cry Amal .
`` Moreover , I owe this man my life .
He shall have his proof . ''
He throw across to me a letter -LRB- well I know the seal -RRB- from Maximus . '
`` We take this out of the ship we sink , '' he cry .
`` I can not read , but I know one sign , at least , which make me believe . ''
He show me a dark stain on the outer roll that my heavy heart perceive be the valiant blood of Maximus . '
`` Read ! ''
say Amal .
`` Read , and then let u hear whose servant you be ! ''
` Said Pertinax , very softly , after he have look through it : `` I will read it all .
Listen , barbarians ! ''
He read that which I have carry next my heart ever since . '
Parnesius draw from his neck a fold and spot piece of parchment , and begin in a hushed voice : -- ' '' To Parnesius and Pertinax , the not unworthy Captains of the Wall , from Maximus , once Emperor of Gaul and Britain , now prisoner wait death by the sea in the camp of Theodosius -- Greeting and Good-bye !
'' ' `` Enough , '' say young Amal ; `` there be your proof !
You must join u now ! ''
` Pertinax look long and silently at him , till that fair man blush like a girl .
Then read Pertinax : -- ' '' I have joyfully do much evil in my life to those who have wish me evil , but if ever I do any evil to you two I repent , and I ask your forgiveness .
The three mule which I strive to drive have tear me in piece a your Father prophesy .
The naked sword wait at the tent door to give me the death I give to Gratian .
Therefore I , your General and your emperor , send you free and honourable dismissal from my service , which you enter , not for money or office , but , a it make me warm to believe , because you love me !
'' ' `` By the Light of the Sun , '' Amal break in .
`` This be in some sort a Man !
We may have be mistake in his servant ! ''
` And Pertinax read on : '' You give me the time for which I ask .
If I have fail to use it , do not lament .
We have gamble very splendidly against the Gods , but they hold weighted dice , and I must pay the forfeit .
Remember , I have be ; but Rome be ; and Rome will be .
Tell Pertinax his Mother be in safety at Nicaea , and her monies be in charge of the Prefect at Antipolis .
Make my remembrance to your Father and to your Mother , whose friendship be great gain to me .
Give also to my little Picts and to the Winged Hats such message a their thick head can understand .
I would have send you three Legions this very day if all have go aright .
Do not forget me .
We have work together .
Farewell !
Farewell !
Farewell !
'' ` Now , that be my Emperor 's last letter . '
-LRB- The child hear the parchment crackle a Parnesius return it to it place . -RRB- '
`` I be mistake , '' say Amal .
`` The servant of such a man will sell nothing except over the sword .
I be glad of it . ''
He hold out his hand to me . '
`` But Maximus have give you your dismissal , '' say an elder .
`` You be certainly free to serve -- or to rule -- whom you please .
Join -- do not follow -- join u ! '' '
`` We thank you , '' say Pertinax .
`` But Maximus tell u to give you such message a -- pardon me , but I use his word -- your thick head can understand . ''
He point through the door to the foot of a catapult wound up . '
`` We understand , '' say an elder .
`` The Wall must be win at a price ? '' '
`` It grieve me , '' say Pertinax , laughing , `` but so it must be win , '' and he give them of our best Southern wine .
` They drink , and wipe their yellow beard in silence till they rise to go .
` Said Amal , stretch himself -LRB- for they be barbarian -RRB- : `` We be a goodly company ; I wonder what the raven and the dogfish will make of some of u before this snow melt . '' '
`` Think rather what Theodosius may send , '' I answer ; and though they laugh , I saw that my chance shot trouble them .
` Only old Allo linger behind a little . '
`` You see , '' he say , wink and blinking , `` I be no more than their dog .
When I have show their men the secret short way across our bog , they will kick me like one . '' '
`` Then I should not be in haste to show them those way , '' say Pertinax , `` till I be sure that Rome could not save the Wall . '' '
`` You think so ?
Woe be me ! ''
say the old man .
`` I only want peace for my people , '' and he go out stumble through the snow behind the tall Winged Hats .
` In this fashion then , slowly , a day at a time , which be very bad for doubt troop , the War come upon u .
At first the Winged Hats sweep in from the sea a they have do before , and there we meet them a before -- with the catapult ; and they sicken of it .
Yet for a long time they would not trust their duck-legs on land , and I think , when it come to reveal the secret of the tribe , the little Picts be afraid or ashamed to show them all the road across the heather .
I have this from a Pict prisoner .
They be as much our spy a our enemy , for the Winged Hats oppress them , and take their winter store .
Ah , foolish Little People !
` Then the Winged Hats begin to roll u up from each end of the Wall .
I send runner Southward to see what the news might be in Britain , but the wolf be very bold that winter , among the deserted station where the troop have once be , and none come back .
We have trouble , too , with the forage for the pony along the Wall .
I keep ten , and so do Pertinax .
We live and sleep in the saddle , rid east or west , and we eat our worn-out pony .
The people of the town also make u some trouble till I gather them all in one quarter behind Hunno .
We break down the Wall on either side of it to make a it be a citadel .
Our men fight well in close order .
` By the end of the second month we be deep in the War a a man be deep in a snowdrift , or in a dream .
I think we fight in our sleep .
At least I know I have go on the Wall and come off again , remember nothing between , though my throat be harsh with give order , and my sword , I could see , have be use .
` The Winged Hats fought like wolf -- all in a pack .
Where they have suffer most , there they charge in most hotly .
This be hard for the defender , but it hold them from sweep on into Britain .
` In those day Pertinax and I write on the plaster of the bricked archway into Valentia the name of the tower , and the day on which they fell one by one .
We wish for some record .
` And the fighting ?
The fight be always hot to leave and right of the great statue of Roma Dea , near to Rutilianus 's house .
By the Light of the Sun , that old fat man , whom we have not consider at all , grow young again among the trumpet !
I remember he say his sword be an oracle !
`` Let u consult the Oracle , '' he would say , and put the handle against his ear , and shake his head wisely .
`` And this day be allow Rutilianus to live , '' he would say , and , tuck up his cloak , he would puff and pant and fight well .
Oh , there be jest in plenty on the Wall to take the place of food !
` We endure for two month and seventeen day -- always be press from three side into a small space .
Several time Allo send in word that help be at hand .
We do not believe it , but it cheer our men .
` The end come not with shouting of joy , but , like the rest , a in a dream .
The Winged Hats suddenly leave u in peace for one night and the next day ; which be too long for spent men .
We sleep at first lightly , expect to be rouse , and then like log , each where he lay .
May you never need such sleep !
When I wake our tower be full of strange , arm men , who watch u snore .
I rouse Pertinax , and we leap up together . '
`` What ? ''
say a young man in clean armour .
`` Do you fight against Theodosius ?
Look ! ''
` North we look over the red snow .
No Winged Hats be there .
South we look over the white snow , and behold there be the Eagles of two strong Legions encamp .
East and west we saw flame and fighting , but by Hunno all be still . '
`` Trouble no more , '' say the young man .
`` Rome 's arm be long .
Where be the Captains of the Wall ? ''
` We say we be those men . '
`` But you be old and grey-haired , '' he cry .
`` Maximus say that they be boy . '' '
`` Yes , that be true some year ago , '' say Pertinax .
`` What be our fate to be , you fine and well-fed child ? '' '
`` I be call Ambrosius , a secretary of the Emperor , '' he answer .
`` Show me a certain letter which Maximus write from a tent at Aquileia , and perhaps I will believe . '' '
I take it from my breast , and when he have read it he salute u , say : `` Your fate be in your own hand .
If you choose to serve Theodosius , he will give you a Legion .
If it suit you to go to your home , we will give you a Triumph . '' '
`` I would like good a bath , wine , food , razor , soap , oil , and scent , '' say Pertinax , laugh . '
`` Oh , I see you be a boy , '' say Ambrosius .
`` And you ? ''
turn to me . '
`` We bear no ill-will against Theodosius , but in War -- '' I begin . '
`` In War it be a it be in Love , '' say Pertinax .
`` Whether she be good or bad , one give one 's best once , to one only .
That give , there remain no second worth give or take . '' '
`` That be true , '' say Ambrosius .
`` I be with Maximus before he die .
He warn Theodosius that you would never serve him , and frankly I say I be sorry for my Emperor . '' '
`` He have Rome to console him , '' say Pertinax .
`` I ask you of your kindness to let u go to our home and get this smell out of our nostril . ''
` None the less they give u a Triumph ! '
` It be well earn , ' say Puck , throw some leaf into the still water of the marlpit .
The black , oily circle spread dizzily a the child watch them . '
I want to know , oh , ever so many thing , ' say Dan .
` What happen to old Allo ?
Did the Winged Hats ever come back ?
And what do Amal do ? '
` And what happen to the fat old General with the five cook ? '
say Una .
` And what do your Mother say when you come home ?
... ' ` She 'd say you 're settin ' too long over this old pit , so late a 't be already , ' say old Hobden 's voice behind them .
` Hst ! '
he whisper .
He stand still , for not twenty pace away a magnificent dog-fox sat on his haunch and look at the child a though he be an old friend of theirs .
` Oh , Mus ' Reynolds , Mus ' Reynolds ! '
say Hobden , under his breath .
` If I know all be inside your head , I 'd know something wuth knowin ' .
Mus ' Dan an ' Miss Una , come along o ' me while I lock up my liddle hen-house . '
A PICT SONG Rome never look where she tread , Always her heavy hoof fall On our stomach , our heart or our head ; And Rome never heed when we bawl .
Her sentry pass on -- that be all , And we gather behind them in horde , And plot to reconquer the Wall , With only our tongue for our sword .
We be the Little Folk -- we !
Too little to love or to hate .
Leave u alone and you 'll see How we can drag down the Great !
We be the worm in the wood !
We be the rot at the root !
We be the germ in the blood !
We be the thorn in the foot !
Mistletoe kill an oak -- Rats gnaw cable in two -- Moths make hole in a cloak -- How they must love what they do !
Yes -- and we Little Folk too , We be as busy a they -- Working our work out of view -- Watch , and you 'll see it some day !
No indeed !
We be not strong , But we know Peoples that be .
Yes , and we 'll guide them along , To smash and destroy you in War !
We shall be slave just the same ?
Yes , we have always be slave , But you -- you will die of the shame , And then we shall dance on your graf !
We be the Little Folk , we , etc . .
HAL O ' THE DRAFT Prophets have honour all over the Earth , Except in the village where they be bear , Where such a knew them boys from birth Nature-ally hold 'em in scorn .
When Prophets be naughty and young and vain , They make a won ` erful grievance of it ; -LRB- You can see by their writing how they complain -RRB- , But Oh , 't be win ` erful good for the Prophet !
There 's nothing Nineveh Town can give -LRB- Nor be swallow by whale between -RRB- , Makes up for the place where a man 's folk live , That do n't care nothing what he have be .
He might ha ' be that , or he might ha ' be this , But they love and they hate him for what he be .
A rainy afternoon drive Dan and Una over to play pirate in the Little Mill .
If you do n't mind rat on the rafter and oat in your shoe , the mill-attic , with it trap-doors and inscription on beam about flood and sweetheart , be a splendid place .
It be light by a foot-square window , call Duck Window , that look across to Little Lindens Farm , and the spot where Jack Cade be kill .
When they have climb the attic ladder -LRB- they call it ` the mainmast tree ' , out of the ballad of Sir Andrew Barton , and Dan ` swarved it with might and main ' , a the ballad say -RRB- they saw a man sit on Duck Window-sill .
He be dress in a plum-coloured doublet and tight plum-coloured hose , and he draw busily in a red-edged book .
` Sit ye !
Sit ye ! '
Puck cry from a rafter overhead .
` See what it be to be beautiful !
Sir Harry Dawe -- pardon , Hal -- say I be the very image of a head for a gargoyle . '
The man laugh and raise his dark velvet cap to the child , and his grizzled hair bristle out in a stormy fringe .
He be old -- forty at least -- but his eye be young , with funny little wrinkle all round them .
A satchel of embroidered leather hung from his broad belt , which look interesting .
` May we see ? '
say Una , come forward .
` Surely -- sure-ly ! '
he say , move up on the window-seat , and return to his work with a silver-pointed pencil .
Puck sit a though the grin be fix for ever on his broad face , while they watch the quick , certain finger that copy it .
Presently the man take a reed pen from his satchel , and trim it with a little ivory knife , carve in the semblance of a fish .
` Oh , what a beauty ! '
cry Dan . ''
Ware finger !
That blade be perilous sharp .
I make it myself of the best Low Country cross-bow steel .
And so , too , this fish .
When his back-fin travel to his tail -- so -- he swallow up the blade , even a the whale swallow Gaffer Jonah ... Yes , and that 's my ink-horn .
I make the four silver saint round it .
Press Barnabas 's head .
It open , and then -- ' He dip the trimmed pen , and with careful boldness begin to put in the essential line of Puck 's rugged face , that have be but faintly reveal by the silver-point .
The child gasp , for it fairly leap from the page .
As he work , and the rain fell on the tile , he talk -- now clearly , now mutter , now break off to frown or smile at his work .
He tell them he be bear at Little Lindens Farm , and his father use to beat him for draw thing instead of do thing , till an old priest call Father Roger , who draw illuminated letter in rich people 's book , coax the parent to let him take the boy a a sort of painter 's apprentice .
Then he go with Father Roger to Oxford , where he clean plate and carry cloak and shoe for the scholar of a College call Merton .
` Did n't you hate that ? '
say Dan after a great many other question . '
I never think o n't .
Half Oxford be build new college or beautify the old , and she have call to her aid the master-craftsmen of all Christendie -- king in their trade and honour of Kings .
I know them .
I work for them : that be enough .
No wonder -- ' He stop and laugh .
` You become a great man , Hal , ' say Puck .
` They say so , Robin .
Even Bramante say so . '
` Why ?
What do you do ? '
Dan ask .
The artist look at him queerly .
` Things in stone and such , up and down England .
You would not have heard of 'em .
To come nearer home , I rebuild this little St Barnabas ' church of ours .
It cost me more trouble and sorrow than aught I 've touch in my life .
But 't be a sound lesson . '
` Um , ' say Dan .
` We 've have lesson this morning . '
` I 'll not afflict ye , lad , ' say Hal , while Puck roar .
` Only 't be strange to think how that little church be rebuild , re-roofed , and make glorious , thanks to some few godly Sussex iron-masters , a Bristow sailor lad , a proud as call Hal o ' the Draft because , d'you see , he be always draw and draft ; and ' -- he drag the word slowly -- ' and a Scotch pirate . '
` Pirate ? '
say Dan .
He wriggle like a hooked fish .
` Even that Andrew Barton you be sing of on the stair just now . '
He dip again in the ink-well , and hold his breath over a sweeping line , a though he have forget everything else .
` Pirates do n't build church , do they ? '
say Dan .
` Or do they ? '
` They help mightily , ' Hal laugh .
` But you be at your lesson this morn , Jack Scholar . '
` Oh , pirate be n't lesson .
It be only Bruce and his silly old spider , ' say Una .
` Why do Sir Andrew Barton help you ? ' '
I question if he ever know it , ' say Hal , twinkle .
` Robin , how a ' mischief 's name be I to tell these innocent what come of sinful pride ? '
` Oh , we know all about that , ' say Una pertly .
` If you get too beany -- that 's cheeky -- you get sat upon , of course . '
Hal consider a moment , pen in air , and Puck say some long word .
` Aha !
that be my case too , ' he cry .
` Beany -- you say -- but certainly I do not conduct myself well .
I be proud of -- of such thing a porch -- a Galilee porch at Lincoln for choice -- proud of one Torrigiano 's arm on my shoulder , proud of my knighthood when I make the gilt scroll-work for the Sovereign -- our King 's ship .
But Father Roger sit in Merton Library , he do not forget me .
At the top of my pride , when I and no other should have build the porch at Lincoln , he lay it on me with a terrible forefinger to go back to my Sussex clay and rebuild , at my own charge , my own church , where u Dawes have be bury for six generation .
`` Out !
Son of my Art ! ''
say he .
`` Fight the Devil at home ere you call yourself a man and a craftsman . ''
And I quake , and I go ... How 's yon , Robin ? '
He flourish the finish sketch before Puck .
` Me !
Me past peradventure , ' say Puck , smirk like a man at a mirror .
` Ah , see !
The rain have take off !
I hate housen in daylight . '
` Whoop !
Holiday ! '
cry Hal , leap up .
` Who 's for my Little Lindens ?
We can talk there . '
They tumble downstairs , and turn past the dripping willow by the sunny mill-dam .
` Body o ' me , ' say Hal , star at the hop-garden , where the hop be just ready to blossom .
` What be these ?
Vines ?
No , not vine , and they twine the wrong way to bean . '
He begin to draw in his ready book .
` Hops .
New since your day , ' say Puck .
` They 're an herb of Mars , and their flower dry flavour ale .
We say -- ` Turkeys , Heresy , Hops , and Beer Came into England all in one year . '
` Heresy I know .
I 've see Hops -- God be praise for their beauty !
What be your Turkis ? '
The child laugh .
They know the Lindens turkey , and as soon a they reach Lindens orchard on the hill the full flock charge at them .
Out come Hal 's book at once .
` Hoity-toity ! '
he cry .
` Here 's Pride in purple feather !
Here 's wrathy contempt and the Pomps of the Flesh !
How d'you call them ? '
` Turkeys !
Turkeys ! '
the child shout , a the old gobbler rave and flame against Hal 's plum-coloured hose . ''
Save Your Magnificence ! '
he say .
` I 've draft two good new thing today . '
And he doff his cap to the bubbling bird .
Then they walk through the grass to the knoll where Little Lindens stand .
The old farmhouse , weather-tiled to the ground , take almost the colour of a blood-ruby in the afternoon light .
The pigeon peck at the mortar in the chimney-stacks ; the bee that have live under the tile since it be build fill the hot August air with their booming ; and the smell of the box-tree by the dairy-window mixed with the smell of earth after rain , bread after baking , and a tickle of wood-smoke .
The farmer 's wife come to the door , baby on arm , shade her brow against the sun , stoop to pluck a sprig of rosemary , and turn down the orchard .
The old spaniel in his barrel bark once or twice to show he be in charge of the empty house .
Puck click back the garden-gate .
'D ` you marvel that I love it ? '
say Hal , in a whisper .
` What can town folk know of the nature of housen -- or land ? '
They perch themselves arow on the old hacked oak bench in Lindens garden , look across the valley of the brook at the fern-covered dimple and hollow of the Forge behind Hobden 's cottage .
The old man be cut a faggot in his garden by the hive .
It be quite a second after his chopper fell that the chump of the blow reach their lazy ear .
` Eh -- yeh ! '
say Hal . '
I mind when where that old gaffer stand be Nether Forge -- Master John Collins 's foundry .
Many a night have his big trip-hammer shook me in my bed here .
Boom-bitty !
Boom-bitty !
If the wind be east , I could hear Master Tom Collins 's forge at Stockens answer his brother , Boom-oop !
Boom-oop !
and midway between , Sir John Pelham 's sledge-hammers at Brightling would strike in like a pack o ' scholar , and '' Hic-haec-hoc '' they 'd say , '' Hic-haec-hoc , '' till I fell asleep .
Yes .
The valley be a full o ' forge and finery a a May shaw o ' cuckoo .
All go to grass now ! '
` What do they make ? '
say Dan .
` Guns for the King 's ship -- and for others .
Serpentines and cannon mostly .
When the gun be cast , down would come the King 's Officers , and take our plough-oxen to haul them to the coast .
Look !
Here 's one of the first and fine craftsman of the Sea ! '
He flutter back a page of his book , and show them a young man 's head .
Underneath be write : ` Sebastianus . '
` He come down with a King 's Order on Master John Collins for twenty serpentines -LRB- wicked little cannon they be ! -RRB-
to furnish a venture of ship .
I draft him thus sit by our fire tell Mother of the new land he 'd find the far side the world .
And he find them , too !
There 's a nose to cleave through unknown sea !
Cabot be his name -- a Bristol lad -- half a foreigner .
I set a heap by him .
He help me to my church-building . ' '
I think that be Sir Andrew Barton , ' say Dan .
` Ay , but foundation before roof , ' Hal answer .
` Sebastian first put me in the way of it .
I have come down here , not to serve God a a craftsman should , but to show my people how great a craftsman I be .
They care not , and it serve me right , one split straw for my craft or my greatness .
What a murrain call have I , they say , to mell with old St Barnabas ' ?
Ruinous the church have be since the Black Death , and ruinous she would remain ; and I could hang myself in my new scaffold-ropes !
Gentle and simple , high and low -- the Hayes , the Fowles , the Fenners , the Collinses -- they be all in a tale against me .
Only Sir John Pelham up yonder at Brightling bid me heart-up and go on .
Yet how could I ?
Did I ask Master Collins for his timber-tug to haul beam ?
The ox have go to Lewes after lime .
Did he promise me a set of iron cramp or tie for the roof ?
They never come to hand , or else they be spaulty or crack .
So with everything .
Nothing say , but naught do except I stand by them , and then do amiss .
I think the countryside be fair bewitch . '
` It be , sure-ly , ' say Puck , knee under chin .
` Did you never suspect ary one ? '
` Not till Sebastian come for his gun , and John Collins play him the same dog 's trick a he 'd play me with my ironwork .
Week in , week out , two of three serpentines would be flaw in the casting , and only fit , they say , to be re-melted .
Then John Collins would shake his head , and vow he could pass no cannon for the King 's service that be not perfect .
Saints !
How Sebastian storm !
I know , for we sit on this bench share our sorrow inter-common .
` When Sebastian have fume away six week at Lindens and get just six serpentines , Dirk Brenzett , Master of the Cygnet hoy , send me word that the block of stone he be fetch me from France for our new font he 'd heave overboard to lighten his ship , chase by Andrew Barton up to Rye Port . '
` Ah !
The pirate ! '
say Dan .
` Yes .
And while I be tear my hair over this , Ticehurst Will , my best mason , come to me shake , and vow that the Devil , horn , tail , and chain , have run out on him from the church-tower , and the men would work there no more .
So I take 'em off the foundation , which we be strengthen , and go into the Bell Tavern for a cup of ale .
Says Master John Collins : `` Have it your own way , lad ; but if I be you , I 'd take the sinnification o ' the sign , and leave old Barnabas ' Church alone ! ''
And they all wag their sinful head , and agree .
Less afraid of the Devil than of me -- a I saw later .
` When I bring my sweet news to Lindens , Sebastian be limewashing the kitchen-beams for Mother .
He love her like a son . '
`` Cheer up , lad , '' he say .
`` God 's where He be .
Only you and I chance to be pure pute ass .
We 've be trick , Hal , and more shame to me , a sailor , that I do not guess it before !
You must leave your belfry alone , forsooth , because the Devil be adrift there ; and I can not get my serpentines because John Collins can not cast them aright .
Meantime Andrew Barton hawk off the Port of Rye .
And why ?
To take those very serpentines which poor Cabot must whistle for ; the say serpentines , I 'll wager my share of new continent , be now hide away in St Barnabas ' church-tower .
Clear a the Irish coast at noonday ! ''
`` They 'd sure never dare to do it , '' I say ; `` and , for another thing , sell cannon to the King 's enemy be black treason -- hanging and fine . '' '
`` It be sure , large profit .
Men 'll dare any gallows for that .
I have be a trader myself , '' say he .
`` We must be upsides with 'em for the honour of Bristol . ''
` Then he hatch a plot , sit on the limewash bucket .
We give out to ride o ' Tuesday to London and make a show of take farewell of our friend -- especially of Master John Collins .
But at Wadhurst Woods we turn ; ride home to the watermeadows ; hide our horse in a willow-tot at the foot of the glebe , and , come night , steal a-tiptoe up hill to Barnabas ' church again .
A thick mist , and a moon strike through . '
I have no sooner lock the tower-door behind u than over go Sebastian full length in the dark . '
`` Pest ! ''
he say .
`` Step high and feel low , Hal .
I 've stumble over gun before . '' '
I grope , and one by one -- the tower be pitchy dark -- I count the lither barrel of twenty serpentines lay out on pea straw .
No conceal at all ! '
`` There 's two demi-cannon my end , '' say Sebastian , slap metal .
`` They 'll be for Andrew Barton 's low deck .
Honest -- honest John Collins !
So this be his warehouse , his arsenal , his armoury !
Now see you why your poking and prying have raise the Devil in Sussex ?
You 've hinder John 's lawful trade for month , '' and he laugh where he lay . '
A clay-cold tower be no fireside at midnight , so we climb the belfry stair , and there Sebastian trip over a cow-hide with it horn and tail . '
`` Aha !
Your Devil have leave his doublet !
Does it become me , Hal ? ''
He draw it on and caper in the shaft of window-moonlight -- win ` erful devilish-like .
Then he sit on the stair , rap with his tail on a board , and his back-aspect be dread than his front , and a howlet lit in , and screech at the horn of him . '
`` If you 'd keep out the Devil , shut the door , '' he whisper .
`` And that 's another false proverb , Hal , for I can hear your tower-door opening . '' '
`` I lock it .
Who a-plague have another key , then ? ''
I say . '
`` All the congregation , to judge by their foot , '' he say , and peer into the blackness .
`` Still !
Still , Hal !
Hear 'em grunt !
That 's more o ' my serpentines , I 'll be bind .
One -- two -- three -- four they bear in !
Faith , Andrew equip himself like an Admiral !
Twenty-four serpentines in all ! ''
` As if it have be an echo , we hear John Collins 's voice come up all hollow : `` Twenty-four serpentines and two demi-cannon .
That 's the full tally for Sir Andrew Barton . '' '
`` Courtesy cost naught , '' whisper Sebastian .
`` Shall I drop my dagger on his head ? '' '
`` They go over to Rye o ' Thursday in the wool-wains , hid under the wool-packs .
Dirk Brenzett meet them at Udimore , a before , '' say John . '
`` Lord !
What a worn , handsmooth trade it be ! ''
say Sebastian .
`` I lay we be the sole two babe in the village that have not our lawful share in the venture . ''
` There be a full score folk below , talk like all Robertsbridge Market .
We count them by voice .
` Master John Collins pip : `` The gun for the French carrack must lie here next month .
Will , when do your young fool '' -LRB- me , so please you ! -RRB-
`` come back from Lunnon ? '' '
`` No odds , '' I hear Ticehurst Will answer .
`` Lay 'em just where you 've a mind , Mus ' Collins .
We 're all too afraid o ' the Devil to mell with the tower now . ''
And the long knave laugh . '
`` Ah !
't be easy enow for you to raise the Devil , Will , '' say another -- Ralph Hobden of the Forge . '
`` Aaa-men ! ''
roar Sebastian , and ere I could hold him , he leap down the stair -- win ` erful devilish-like howl no bound .
He have scarce time to lay out for the near than they run .
Saints , how they run !
We hear them pound on the door of the Bell Tavern , and then we run too . '
`` What 's next ? ''
say Sebastian , loop up his cow-tail a he leap the briar .
`` I 've break honest John 's face . '' '
`` Ride to Sir John Pelham 's , '' I say .
`` He be the only one that ever stand by me . ''
` We ride to Brightling , and past Sir John 's lodge , where the keeper would have shoot at u for deer-stealers , and we have Sir John down into his Justice 's chair , and when we have tell him our tale and show him the cow-hide which Sebastian wore still gird about him , he laugh till the tear run . '
`` Wel-a-well ! ''
he say .
`` I 'll see justice do before daylight .
What 's your complaint ?
Master Collins be my old friend . '' '
`` He 's none of mine , '' I cry .
`` When I think how he and his like have baulk and dozened and cozen me at every turn over the church '' -- and I choke at the thought . '
`` Ah , but ye see now they need it for another use , '' say he smoothly . '
`` So they do my serpentines , '' Sebastian cry .
`` I should be half across the Western Ocean by now if my gun have be ready .
But they 're sell to a Scotch pirate by your old friend -- '' ' `` Where 's your proof ? ''
say Sir John , stroke his beard . '
`` I break my shin over them not an hour since , and I hear John give order where they be to be take , '' say Sebastian . '
`` Words !
Words only , '' say Sir John .
`` Master Collins be somewhat of a liar at best . ''
` He carry it so gravely that , for the moment , I think he be dip in this secret traffick too , and that there be not an honest ironmaster in Sussex . '
`` Name o ' Reason ! ''
say Sebastian , and rap with his cow-tail on the table , `` whose gun be they , then ? '' '
`` Yours , manifestly , '' say Sir John .
`` You come with the King 's Order for 'em , and Master Collins cast them in his foundry .
If he choose to bring them up from Nether Forge and lay 'em out in the church-tower , why , they be e ` en so much the nearer to the main road and you be save a day 's hauling .
What a coil to make of a mere act of neighbourly kindness , lad ! '' '
`` I fear I have requite him very scurvily , '' say Sebastian , look at his knuckle .
`` But what of the demi-cannon ?
I could do with 'em well , but they be not in the King 's Order . '' '
`` Kindness -- loving-kindness , '' say Sir John .
`` Questionless , in his zeal for the King and his love for you , John add those two cannon a a gift .
'T be plain a this come daylight , ye stockfish ! '' '
`` So it be , '' say Sebastian .
`` Oh , Sir John , Sir John , why do you never use the sea ?
You be lose ashore . ''
And he look on him with great love . '
`` I do my best in my station . ''
Sir John stroke his beard again and roll forth his deep drumming Justice 's voice thus : `` But -- suffer me !
-- you two lad , on some midnight frolic into which I probe not , roystering around the tavern , surprise Master Collins at his '' -- he think a moment -- `` at his good deed do by stealth .
Ye surprise him , I say , cruelly . '' '
`` Truth , Sir John .
If you have see him run ! ''
say Sebastian . '
`` On this you ride breakneck to me with a tale of pirate , and wool-wains , and cow-hides , which , though it hath move my mirth a a man , offendeth my reason a a magistrate .
So I will e ` en accompany you back to the tower with , perhaps , some few of my own people , and three-four wagon , and I 'll be your warrant that Master John Collins will freely give you your gun and your demi-cannon , Master Sebastian . ''
He break into his proper voice -- `` I warn the old tod and his neighbour long ago that they 'd come to trouble with their side-sellings and bye-dealings ; but we can not have half Sussex hang for a little gun-running .
Are ye content , lad ? '' '
`` I 'd commit any treason for two demi-cannon , '' say Sebastian , and rub his hand . '
`` Ye have just compound with rank treason-felony for the same bribe , '' say Sir John .
`` Wherefore to horse , and get the gun . '' '
` But Master Collins mean the gun for Sir Andrew Barton all along , do n't he ? '
say Dan .
` Questionless , that he do , ' say Hal .
` But he lose them .
We pour into the village on the red edge of dawn , Sir John horse , in half-armour , his pennon fly ; behind him thirty stout Brightling knave , five abreast ; behind them four wool-wains , and behind them four trumpet to triumph over the jest , blowing : Our King go forth to Normandie .
When we halt and roll the ringing gun out of the tower , 't be for all the world like Friar Roger 's picture of the French siege in the Queen 's Missal-book . '
` And what do we -- I mean , what do our village do ? '
say Dan .
` Oh !
Bore it nobly -- nobly , ' cry Hal .
` Though they have trick me , I be proud of them .
They come out of their housen , look at that little army a though it have be a post , and go their shut-mouthed way .
Never a sign !
Never a word !
They 'd ha ' perished sooner than let Brightling overcrow u .
Even that villain , Ticehurst Will , come out of the Bell for his morning ale , he all but run under Sir John 's horse . ' ''
` Ware , Sirrah Devil ! ''
cry Sir John , rein back . '
`` Oh ! ''
say Will .
`` Market-day , be it ?
And all the bullock from Brightling here ? '' '
I spar him his belting for that -- the brazen knave !
` But John Collins be our masterpiece !
He happen along-street -LRB- his jaw tie up where Sebastian have clout him -RRB- when we be trundle the first demi-cannon through the lych-gate . '
`` I reckon you 'll find her middlin ' heavy , '' he say .
`` If you 've a mind to pay , I 'll loan ye my timber-tug .
She wo n't lie easy on ary wool-wain . ''
` That be the one time I ever saw Sebastian take flat aback .
He open and shut his mouth , fishy-like . '
`` No offence , '' say Master John .
`` You 've get her reasonable good cheap .
I think ye might not grudge me a groat if I help move her . ''
Ah , he be a masterpiece !
They say that morning 's work cost our John two hundred pound , and he never wink an eyelid , not even when he saw the gun all cart off to Lewes . '
` Neither then nor later ? '
say Puck .
` Once .
'T be after he give St Barnabas ' the new chime of bell .
-LRB- Oh , there be nothing the Collinses , or the Hayes , or the Fowles , or the Fenners would not do for the church then !
`` Ask and have '' be their song . -RRB-
We have ring 'em in , and he be in the tower with Black Nick Fowle , that give u our rood-screen .
The old man pinch the bell-rope one hand and scratch his neck with t ` other .
`` Sooner she be pull yon clapper than my neck , he say .
That be all !
That be Sussex -- seely Sussex for everlastin ' ! '
` And what happen after ? '
say Una . '
I go back into England , ' say Hal , slowly .
` I 'd have my lesson against pride .
But they tell me I leave St Barnabas ' a jewel -- justabout a jewel !
Wel-a-well !
'T be do for and among my own people , and -- Father Roger be right -- I never know such trouble or such triumph since .
That 's the nature o ' thing .
A dear -- dear land . '
He drop his chin on his chest .
` There 's your Father at the Forge .
What 's he talk to old Hobden about ? '
say Puck , open his hand with three leaf in it .
Dan look towards the cottage .
` Oh , I know .
It 's that old oak lie across the brook .
Pater always want it grub . '
In the still valley they could hear old Hobden 's deep tone .
` Have it a you 've a mind to , ' he be say .
` But the vivers of her root they hold the bank together .
If you grub her out , the bank she 'll all come tearin ' down , an ' next flood the brook 'll swarve up .
But have it a you 've a mind .
The Mistuss she set a heap by the fern on her trunk .
` Oh !
I 'll think it over , ' say the Pater .
Una laugh a little bubbling chuckle .
` What Devil 's in that belfry ? '
say Hal , with a lazy laugh .
` That should be a Hobden by his voice . '
` Why , the oak be the regular bridge for all the rabbit between the Three Acre and our meadow .
The best place for wire on the farm , Hobden say .
He 's get two there now , ' Una answer . '
He wo n't ever let it be grub ! '
` Ah , Sussex !
Sillly Sussex for everlastin ' , ' murmur Hal ; and the next moment their Father 's voice call across to Little Lindens break the spell a little St Barnabas ' clock strike five .
A SMUGGLERS ' SONG If You wake at midnight , and hear a horse 's foot , Do n't go draw back the blind , or look in the street , Them that ask no question be n't tell a lie .
Watch the wall , my darling , while the Gentlemen go by !
Five-and-twenty pony , Trotting through the dark -- Brandy for the Parson , ` Baccy for the Clerk ; Laces for a lady ; letter for a spy , And watch the wall , my darling , while the Gentlemen go by !
Running round the woodlump if you chance to find Little barrel , rope and tar , all full of brandy-wine ; Do n't you shout to come and look , nor take 'em for your play ; Put the brishwood back again , -- and they 'll be go next day !
If you see the stable-door setting open wide ; If you see a tired horse lie down inside ; If your mother mend a coat cut about and tore ; If the lining 's wet and warm -- do n't you ask no more !
If you meet King George 's men , dress in blue and red , You be careful what you say , and mindful what be say .
If they call you ` pretty maid , ' and chuck you ` neath the chin , Do n't you tell where no one be , nor yet where no one 's be !
Knocks and footstep round the house -- whistle after dark -- You 've no call for run out till the house-dogs bark .
Trusty 's here , and Pincher 's here , and see how dumb they lie -- They do n't fret to follow when the Gentlemen go by !
If you do a you 've be tell , ` likely there 's a chance , You 'll be give a dainty doll , all the way from France , With a cap of Valenciennes , and a velvet hood -- A present from the Gentlemen , along o ' be good !
Five-and-twenty pony , Trotting through the dark -- Brandy for the Parson , ` Baccy for the Clerk .
Them that ask no question be n't tell a lie -- Watch the wall , my darling , while the Gentlemen go by !
` DYMCHURCH FLIT ' THE BEE BOY 'S SONG Bees !
Bees !
Hark to your bee !
` Hide from your neighbour as much a you please , But all that have happen , to u you must tell , Or else we will give you no honey to sell ! '
A Maiden in her glory , Upon her wedding-day , Must tell her Bees the story , Or else they 'll fly away .
Fly away -- die away -- Dwindle down and leave you !
But if you do n't deceive your Bees , Your Bees will not deceive you .
Marriage , birth or buryin ' , News across the sea , All you 're sad or merry in , You must tell the Bees .
Tell 'em come in an ' out , Where the Fanners fan , 'Cause the Bees be justabout As curious a a man !
Do n't you wait where tree be , When the lightning play ; Nor do n't you hate where Bees be , Or else they 'll pine away .
Pine away -- dwine away -- Anything to leave you !
But if you never grieve your Bees , Your Bees 'll never grieve you !
Just at dusk , a soft September rain begin to fall on the hop-picker .
The mother wheel the bouncing perambulator out of the garden ; bin be put away , and tally-books make up .
The young couple stroll home , two to each umbrella , and the single men walk behind them laugh .
Dan and Una , who have be pick after their lesson , march off to roast potato at the oast-house , where old Hobden , with Blue-eyed Bess , his lurcher dog , live all the month through , dry the hop .
They settle themselves , a usual , on the sack-strewn cot in front of the fire , and , when Hobden draw up the shutter , star , a usual , at the flameless bed of coal spout it heat up the dark well of the old-fashioned roundel .
Slowly he crack off a few fresh piece of coal , pack them , with finger that never flinch , exactly where they would do most good ; slowly he reach behind him till Dan tilt the potato into his iron scoop of a hand ; carefully he arrange them round the fire , and then stand for a moment , black against the glare .
As he close the shutter , the oast-house seem dark before the day 's end , and he light the candle in the lanthorn .
The child like all these thing because they know them so well .
The Bee Boy , Hobden 's son , who be not quite right in his head , though he can do anything with bee , slip in like a shadow .
They only guess it when Bess 's stump-tail wag against them .
A big voice begin sing outside in the drizzle : ` Old Mother Laidinwool have nigh twelve month be dead , She hear the hop be doin ' well , and then pop up her head . '
` There ca n't be two people make to holler like that ! '
cry old Hobden , wheel round .
` For , ' say she , ` The boy I 've pick with when I be young and fair , They 're bind to be at hoppin ' , and I 'm -- ' A man show at the doorway .
` Well , well !
They do say hoppin ' 'll draw the very dead , and now I belieft 'em .
You , Tom ?
Tom Shoesmith ? '
Hobden lower his lanthorn .
` You 're a hem of a time makin ' your mind to it , Ralph ! '
The stranger strode in -- three full inch taller than Hobden , a grey-whiskered , brown-faced giant with clear blue eye .
They shake hand , and the child could hear the hard palm rasp together .
` You ai n't lose none o ' your grip , ' say Hobden .
` Was it thirty or forty year back you break my head at Peasmarsh Fair ? '
` Only thirty , an ' no odds ` tween u regardin ' head , neither .
You have it back at me with a hop-pole .
How do we get home that night ?
Swimmin ' ? '
` Same way the pheasant come into Gubbs 's pocket -- by a little luck an ' a deal o ' conjurin ' . '
Old Hobden laugh in his deep chest . '
I see you 've not forget your way about the wood .
D 'ye do any o ' this still ? '
The stranger pretend to look along a gun .
Hobden answer with a quick movement of the hand a though he be peg down a rabbit-wire .
` No .
That 's all that 's leave me now .
Age she must as Age she can .
An ' what 's your news since all these year ? '
` Oh , I 've bin to Plymouth , I 've bin to Dover -- I 've bin ramblin ' , boy , the wide world over , ' the man answer cheerily . '
I reckon I know as much of Old England a most . '
He turn towards the child and wink boldly . '
I lay they tell you a sight o ' lie , then .
I 've be into England fur a Wiltsheer once .
I be cheat proper over a pair of hedgin ' - glove , ' say Hobden .
` There 's fancy-talkin ' everywhere .
You 've cleave to your own part pretty middlin ' close , Ralph . '
` Ca n't shift an old tree ` thout it dyin ' , ' Hobden chuckle .
` An ' I be no more anxious to die than you look to be to help me with my hop tonight . '
The great man lean against the brickwork of the roundel , and swing his arm abroad .
` Hire me ! '
be all he say , and they stump upstairs laughing .
The child hear their shovel rasp on the cloth where the yellow hop lie dry above the fire , and all the oast-house fill with the sweet , sleepy smell a they be turn .
` Who be it ? '
Una whisper to the Bee Boy .
` Dunno , no more 'n you -- if you dunno , ' say he , and smile .
The voice on the drying-floor talked and chuckle together , and the heavy footstep move back and forth .
Presently a hop-pocket drop through the press-hole overhead , and stiffen and fatten a they shovel it full .
` Clank ! '
go the press , and ram the loose stuff into tight cake .
` Gently ! '
they hear Hobden cry .
` You 'll bust her crop if you lay on so .
You be as careless a Gleason 's bull , Tom .
Come an ' sit by the fire .
She 'll do now . '
They come down , and a Hobden open the shutter to see if the potato be do Tom Shoesmith say to the child , ` Put a plenty salt on 'em .
That 'll show you the sort o ' man I be . '
Again he wink , and again the Bee Boy laugh and Una star at Dan . '
I know what sort o ' man you be , ' old Hobden grunt , grope for the potato round the fire .
` Do ye ? '
Tom go on behind his back .
` Some of u ca n't abide Horseshoes , or Church Bells , or Running Water ; an ' , talkin ' o ' runnin ' water ' -- he turn to Hobden , who be back out of the roundel -- 'd ` you mind the great flood at Robertsbridge , when the miller 's man be drown in the street ? '
` Middlin ' well . '
Old Hobden let himself down on the coal by the fire-door . '
I be courtin ' my woman on the Marsh that year .
Carter to Mus ' Plum I be , gettin ' ten shillin 's week .
Mine be a Marsh woman . '
` Won ` erful odd-gates place -- Romney Marsh , ' say Tom Shoesmith .
` I 've hear say the world 's divide like into Europe , Ashy , Afriky , Ameriky , Australy , an ' Romney Marsh . '
` The Marsh folk think so , ' say Hobden . '
I have a hem o ' trouble to get my woman to leave it . '
` Where do she come out of ?
I 've forget , Ralph . '
` Dymchurch under the Wall , ' Hobden answer , a potato in his hand .
` Then she 'd be a Pett -- or a Whitgift , would she ? '
` Whitgift . '
Hobden break open the potato and eat it with the curious neatness of men who make most of their meal in the blowy open .
` She grow to be quite reasonable-like after livin ' in the Weald awhile , but our first twenty year or two she be odd-fashioned , no bound .
And she be a won ` erful hand with bee . '
He cut away a little piece of potato and throw it out to the door .
` Ah !
I 've hear say the Whitgifts could see far through a millstone than most , ' say Shoesmith .
` Did she , now ? '
` She be honest-innocent of any nigromancin ' , ' say Hobden .
` Only she 'd read sign and sinnifications out o ' bird flyin ' , star fallin ' , bee hivin ' , and such .
An , she 'd lie awake -- listenin ' for call , she say . '
` That do n't prove naught , ' say Tom .
` All Marsh folk have be smuggler since time everlastin ' .
` Twould be in her blood to listen out o ' night . '
` Nature-ally , ' old Hobden reply , smile . '
I mind when there be smugglin ' a sight nearer u than what the Marsh be .
But that be n't my woman 's trouble .
'T be a passel o ' no-sense talk ' -- he drop his voice -- ` about Pharisees . '
` Yes .
I 've hear Marsh men belieft in 'em . '
Tom look straight at the wide-eyed child beside Bess .
` Pharisees , ' cry Una .
` Fairies ?
Oh , I see ! '
` People o ' the Hills , ' say the Bee Boy , throw half of his potato towards the door .
` There you be ! '
say Hobden , point at him .
My boy -- he have her eye and her out-gate sense .
That 's what she call 'em ! '
` And what do you think of it all ? '
` Um -- um , ' Hobden rumble . '
A man that use field an ' shaw after dark as much a I 've do , he do n't go out of his road excep ' for keeper . '
` But settin ' that aside ? '
say Tom , coaxingly . '
I saw ye throw the Good Piece out-at-doors just now .
Do ye believe or -- do ye ? '
` There be a great black eye to that tater , ' say Hobden indignantly .
` My liddle eye do n't see un , then .
It look a if you mean it for -- for Any One that might need it .
But settin ' that aside , d 'ye believe or -- do ye ? ' '
I ai n't sayin ' nothin ' , because I 've hear naught , an ' I 've see naught .
But if you be to say there be more thing after dark in the shaw than men , or fur , or feather , or fin , I dunno a I 'd go far about to call you a liar .
Now turnagain , Tom .
What 's your say ? '
` I 'm like you .
I say nothin ' .
But I 'll tell you a tale , an ' you can fit it a how you please . '
` Passel o ' no-sense stuff , ' growl Hobden , but he fill his pipe .
` The Marsh men they call it Dymchurch Flit , ' Tom go on slowly .
` Hap you have hear it ? '
` My woman she 've tell it me score o ' time .
Dunno a I do n't end by belieftin ' it -- sometimes . '
Hobden cross over a he speak , and suck with his pipe at the yellow lanthorn flame .
Tom rest one great elbow on one great knee , where he sit among the coal .
` Have you ever bin in the Marsh ? '
he say to Dan .
` Only as far a Rye , once , ' Dan answer .
` Ah , that 's but the edge .
Back behind of her there 's steeple settin ' beside church , an ' wise woman settin ' beside their door , an ' the sea settin ' above the land , an ' duck herdin ' wild in the diks ' -LRB- he mean ditch -RRB- .
` The Marsh be justabout riddled with diks an ' sluice , an ' tide-gates an ' water-lets .
You can hear 'em bubblin ' an ' grummelin ' when the tide work in 'em , an ' then you hear the sea rangin ' left and right-handed all up along the Wall .
You 've see how flat she be -- the Marsh ?
You 'd think nothin ' easy than to walk eend-on acrost her ?
Ah , but the diks an ' the water-lets , they twist the road about as ravelly a witch-yarn on the spindle .
So ye get all turn round in broad daylight . '
` That 's because they 've dreened the water into the diks , ' say Hobden .
` When I court my woman the rush be green -- Eh me !
the rush be green -- an ' the Bailiff o ' the Marshes he ride up and down as free a the fog . '
` Who be he ? '
say Dan .
` Why , the Marsh fever an ' ague .
He 've clap me on the shoulder once or twice till I shake proper .
But now the dreenin ' off of the water have do away with the fever ; so they make a joke , like , that the Bailiff o ' the Marshes break his neck in a dik .
A won ` erful place for bee an ' duck 't be too . '
` An ' old , ' Tom go on .
` Flesh an ' Blood have be there since Time Everlastin ' Beyond .
Well , now , speakin ' among themselves , the Marsh men say that from Time Everlastin ' Beyond , the Pharisees favour the Marsh above the rest of Old England .
I lay the Marsh men ought to know .
They 've be out after dark , father an ' son , smugglin ' some one thing or t ` other , since ever wool grow to sheep 's back .
They say there be always a middlin ' few Pharisees to be see on the Marsh .
Impident a rabbit , they be .
They 'd dance on the nakid road in the nakid daytime ; they 'd flash their liddle green light along the diks , comin ' an ' goin ' , like honest smuggler .
Yes , an ' time they 'd lock the church door against parson an ' clerk of Sundays . '
` That ` ud be smuggler layin ' in the lace or the brandy till they could run it out o ' the Marsh .
I 've tell my woman so , ' say Hobden .
` I 'll lay she do n't belieft it , then -- not if she be a Whitgift .
A won ` erful choice place for Pharisees , the Marsh , by all account , till Queen Bess 's father he come in with his Reformatories . '
` Would that be a Act of Parliament like ? '
Hobden ask .
` Sure-ly .
Ca n't do nothing in Old England without Act , Warrant an ' Summons .
He get his Act allow him , an ' , they say , Queen Bess 's father he use the parish church something shameful .
Justabout tore the gizzard out of I dunnamany .
Some folk in England they hold with ` en ; but some they saw it different , an ' it eended in 'em takin ' side an ' burnin ' each other no bound , accordin ' which side be top , time bein ' .
That tarrified the Pharisees : for Goodwill among Flesh an ' Blood be meat an ' drink to 'em , an ' ill-will be poison . '
` Same a bee , ' say the Bee Boy .
` Bees wo n't stay by a house where there 's hat . '
` True , ' say Tom .
` This Reformatories tarrified the Pharisees same a the reaper goin ' round a last stand o ' wheat tarrifies rabbit .
They pack into the Marsh from all part , and they say , `` Fair or foul , we must flit out o ' this , for Merry England 's do with , an ' we 're reckon among the Images . '' '
` Did they all see it that way ? '
say Hobden .
` All but one that be call Robin -- if you 've hear of him .
What be you laughin ' at ? '
Tom turn to Dan .
` The Pharisees 's trouble do n't tech Robin , because he 'd cleave middlin ' close to people , like .
No more he never mean to go out of Old England -- not he ; so he be send messagin ' for help among Flesh an ' Blood .
But Flesh an ' Blood must always think of their own concern , an ' Robin could n't get through at 'em , ye see .
They think it be tide-echoes off the Marsh . '
` What do you -- what do the fai -- Pharisees want ? '
Una ask . '
A boat , to be sure .
Their liddle wing could no more cross Channel than so many tired butterfly .
A boat an ' a crew they desire to sail 'em over to France , where yet awhile folk have n't tore down the Images .
They could n't abide cruel Canterbury Bells ringin ' to Bulverhithe for more pore men an ' woman to be burnded , nor the King 's proud messenger ridin ' through the land givin ' order to tear down the Images .
They could n't abide it no shape .
Nor yet they could n't get their boat an ' crew to flit by without Leave an ' Good-will from Flesh an ' Blood ; an ' Flesh an ' Blood come an ' go about it own business the while the Marsh be swarvin ' up , an ' swarvin ' up with Pharisees from all England over , strivin ' all mean to get through at Flesh an ' Blood to tell 'em their sore need ... I do n't know a you 've ever hear say Pharisees be like chicken ? '
` My woman use to say that too , ' say Hobden , fold his brown arm .
` They be .
You run too many chicken together , an ' the ground sicken , like , an ' you get a squat , an ' your chicken die .
Same way , you crowd Pharisees all in one place -- they do n't die , but Flesh an ' Blood walkin ' among 'em be apt to sick up an ' pine off .
They do n't mean it , an ' Flesh an ' Blood do n't know it , but that 's the truth -- a I 've hear .
The Pharisees through bein ' all stenched up an ' fright , an ' try ' to come through with their supplication , they nature-ally change the thin air an ' humour in Flesh an ' Blood .
It lay on the Marsh like thunder .
Men saw their church ablaze with the wildfire in the window after dark ; they saw their cattle scatterin ' an ' no man scarin ' ; their sheep flockin ' an ' no man drivin ' ; their horse latherin ' an ' no man leadin ' ; they saw the liddle low green light more than ever in the dik-sides ; they hear the liddle foot patterin ' more than ever round the house ; an ' night an ' day , day an ' night , 't be all a though they be bein ' creep up on , an ' hint at by Some One or other that could n't rightly shape their trouble .
Oh , I lay they sweat !
Man an ' maid , woman an ' child , their nature do 'em no service all the week while the Marsh be swarvin ' up with Pharisees .
But they be Flesh an ' Blood , an ' Marsh men before all .
They reckon the sign sinnified trouble for the Marsh .
Or that the sea ` ud rear up against Dymchurch Wall an ' they 'd be drownded like Old Winchelsea ; or that the Plague be comin ' .
So they look for the meanin ' in the sea or in the cloud -- far an ' high up .
They never think to look near an ' knee-high , where they could see naught .
` Now there be a poor widow at Dymchurch under the Wall , which , lack man or property , she have the more time for feeling ; and she come to feel there be a Trouble outside her doorstep big an ' heavy than aught she 'd ever carry over it .
She have two son -- one born blind , an ' t ` other struck dumb through fallin ' off the Wall when he be liddle .
They be men grow , but not wage-earnin ' , an ' she work for 'em , keepin ' bee and answerin ' Questions . '
` What sort of question ? '
say Dan .
` Like where lose thing might be find , an ' what to put about a crooked baby 's neck , an ' how to join parted sweetheart .
She felt the Trouble on the Marsh same a eel feel thunder .
She be a wise woman . '
` My woman be win ` erful weather-tender , too , ' say Hobden .
` I 've see her brish spark like off an anvil out of her hair in thunderstorm .
But she never lay out to answer Questions . '
` This woman be a Seeker , like , an ' Seekers they sometimes find .
One night , while she lay abed , hot an ' achin ' , there come a Dream an ' tapped at her window , an ' `` Widow Whitgift , '' it say , `` Widow Whitgift ! ''
` First , by the wing an ' the whistlin ' , she think it be peewit , but last she arise an ' dress herself , an ' open her door to the Marsh , an ' she felt the Trouble an ' the Groanin ' all about her , strong a fever an ' ague , an ' she call : `` What be it ?
Oh , what be it ? ''
` Then 't be all like the frog in the diks peepin ' ; then 't be all like the reed in the diks clip-clappin ' ; an ' then the great Tide-wave rummelled along the Wall , an ' she could n't hear proper .
` Three time she call , an ' three time the Tide-wave do her down .
But she catch the quiet between , an ' she cry out , `` What be the Trouble on the Marsh that 's be lie down with my heart an ' arise with my body this month go ? ''
She felt a liddle hand lay hold on her gown-hem , an ' she stoop to the pull o ' that liddle hand . '
Tom Shoesmith spread his huge fist before the fire and smile at it . '
`` Will the sea drown the Marsh ? ''
she say .
She be a Marsh woman first an ' foremost . '
`` No , '' say the liddle voice .
`` Sleep sound for all o ' that . '' '
`` Is the Plague comin ' to the Marsh ? ''
she say .
Them be all the ill she know . '
`` No .
Sleep sound for all o ' that , '' say Robin .
` She turn about , half mindful to go in , but the liddle voice grieve that shrill an ' sorrowful she turn back , an ' she cry : `` If it be not a Trouble of Flesh an ' Blood , what can I do ? ''
` The Pharisees cry out upon her from all round to fetch them a boat to sail to France , an ' come back no more . '
`` There 's a boat on the Wall , '' she say , `` but I ca n't push it down to the sea , nor sail it when 't be there . '' '
`` Lend u your son , '' say all the Pharisees .
`` Give 'em Leave an ' Good-will to sail it for u , Mother -- O Mother ! '' '
`` One 's dumb , an ' t ` other 's blind , '' she say .
`` But all the dearer me for that ; and you 'll lose them in the big sea . ''
The voice justabout pierce through her ; an ' there be child 's voice too .
She stand out all she could , but she could n't rightly stand against that .
So she say : `` If you can draw my son for your job , I 'll not hinder 'em .
You ca n't ask no more of a Mother . ''
` She saw them liddle green light dance an ' cross till she be dizzy ; she hear them liddle foot patterin ' by the thousand ; she hear cruel Canterbury Bells ring to Bulverhithe , an ' she hear the great Tide-wave ranging along the Wall .
That be while the Pharisees be workin ' a Dream to wake her two son asleep : an ' while she bite on her finger she saw them two she 'd bore come out an ' pas her with never a word .
She follow 'em , cryin ' pitiful , to the old boat on the Wall , an ' that they take an ' runned down to the sea .
` When they 'd step mast an ' sail the blind son speak : `` Mother , we 're waitin ' your Leave an ' Good-will to take Them over . '' '
Tom Shoesmith throw back his head and half shut his eye .
` Eh , me ! '
he say .
` She be a fine , valiant woman , the Widow Whitgift .
She stand twistin ' the eends of her long hair over her finger , an ' she shake like a poplar , makin ' up her mind .
The Pharisees all about they hush their child from cryin ' an ' they wait dumb-still .
She be all their dependence .
` Thout her Leave an ' Good-will they could not pass ; for she be the Mother .
So she shake like a aps-tree makin ' up her mind .
` Last she drive the word past her teeth , an ' `` Go ! ''
she say .
`` Go with my Leave an ' Goodwill . ''
` Then I saw -- then , they say , she have to brace back same a if she be wadin ' in tide-water ; for the Pharisees just about flow past her -- down the beach to the boat , I dunnamany of 'em -- with their wife an ' childern an ' valooables , all escapin ' out of cruel Old England .
Silver you could hear chinkin ' , an ' liddle bundle heave down dunt on the bottom-boards , an ' passel o ' liddle sword an ' shield raklin ' , an ' liddle finger an ' toe scratchin ' on the boatside to board her when the two son push her off .
That boat she sink low an ' low , but all the Widow could see in it be her boys movin ' hampered-like to get at the tackle .
Up sail they do , an ' away they go , deep a a Rye barge , away into the off-shore mist , an ' the Widow Whitgift she sit down an ' ease her grief till mornin ' light . ' '
I never hear she be all alone , ' say Hobden . '
I remember now .
The one call Robin , he stay with her , they tell .
She be all too grievious to listen to his promise . '
` Ah !
She should ha ' make her bargain beforehand .
I allus told my woman so ! '
Hobden cry .
` No .
She loan her son for a pure love-loan , bein ' a she sense the Trouble on the Marshes , an ' be simple good-willin ' to ease it . '
Tom laugh softly .
` She do that .
Yes , she do that !
From Hithe to Bulverhithe , fretty man an ' maid , ailin ' woman an ' wailin ' child , they take the advantage of the change in the thin air just about as soon a the Pharisees flit .
Folks come out fresh an ' shinin ' all over the Marsh like snail after wet .
An ' that while the Widow Whitgift sit grievin ' on the Wall .
She might have belieft u -- she might have trust her son would be send back !
She fuss , no bound , when their boat come in after three day . '
` And , of course , the son be both quite cure ? '
say Una .
` No-o .
That would have be out o ' Nature .
She get 'em back a she send 'em .
The blind man he have n't see naught of anythin ' , an ' the dumb man nature-ally he could n't say aught of what he 'd see .
I reckon that be why the Pharisees pitch on 'em for the ferryin ' job . '
` But what do you -- what do Robin promise the Widow ? '
say Dan .
` What do he promise , now ? '
Tom pretend to think .
` Was n't your woman a Whitgift , Ralph ?
Did n't she ever say ? '
` She tell me a passel o ' no-sense stuff when he be bear . '
Hobden point at his son .
` There be always to be one of 'em that could see far into a millstone than most . '
` Me !
That 's me ! '
say the Bee Boy so suddenly that they all laugh .
` I 've get it now ! '
cried Tom , slap his knee .
` So long a Whitgift blood last , Robin promise there would allers be one o ' her stock that -- that no Trouble ` ud lie on , no Maid ` ud sigh on , no Night could frighten , no Fright could harm , no Harm could make sin , an ' no Woman could make a fool of . '
` Well , ai n't that just me ? '
say the Bee Boy , where he sit in the silver square of the great September moon that be star into the oast-house door .
` They be the exact word she tell me when we first find he be n't like others .
But it beat me how you know 'em , ' say Hobden .
` Aha !
There 's more under my hat besides hair ? '
Tom laugh and stretch himself .
` When I 've see these two young folk home , we 'll make a night of old day , Ralph , with passin ' old tale -- eh ?
An ' where might you live ? '
he say , gravely , to Dan .
` An ' do you think your Pa ` ud give me a drink for takin ' you there , Missy ? '
They giggle so at this that they have to run out .
Tom pick them both up , set one on each broad shoulder , and tramp across the ferny pasture where the cow puff milky puff at them in the moonlight .
` Oh , Puck !
Puck !
I guess you right from when you talk about the salt .
How could you ever do it ? '
Una cry , swing along delight .
` Do what ? '
he say , and climb the stile by the pollard oak .
` Pretend to be Tom Shoesmith , ' say Dan , and they duck to avoid the two little ash that grow by the bridge over the brook .
Tom be almost run .
` Yes .
That 's my name , Mus ' Dan , ' he say , hurry over the silent shin lawn , where a rabbit sit by the big white-thorn near the croquet ground .
` Here you be . '
He stride into the old kitchen yard , and slide them down a Ellen come to ask question .
` I 'm help in Mus ' Spray 's oast-house , ' he say to her .
` No , I 'm no foreigner .
I know this country ` fore your mother be bear ; an ' -- yes , it 's dry work oastin ' , Miss . .
Thank you . '
Ellen go to get a jug , and the child go in -- magicked once more by Oak , Ash , and Thorn !
A THREE-PART SONG I 'm just in love with all these three , The Weald an ' the Marsh an ' the Down countrie ; Nor I do n't know which I love the most , The Weald or the Marsh or the white chalk coast !
I 've bury my heart in a ferny hill , Twix ' a liddle low shaw an ' a great high gill .
Oh , hop-bine yaller an ' woodsmoke blue , I reckon you 'll keep her middle true !
I 've loose my mind for to out an ' run On a Marsh that be old when Kings begin : Oh , Romney level an ' Brenzett reed , I reckon you know what my mind need !
I 've give my soul to the Southdown grass , An ' sheep-bells tinkle where you pass .
Oh , Firle an ' Ditchling an ' sail at sea , I reckon you keep my soul for me !
THE TREASURE AND THE LAW SONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER When first by Eden Tree The Four Great Rivers run , To each be appoint a Man Her Prince and Ruler to be .
But after this be ordain , -LRB- The ancient legend tell -RRB- , There come dark Israel , For whom no River remain .
Then He That be Wholly Just Said to him : ` Fling on the ground A handful of yellow dust , And a Fifth Great River shall run , Mightier than these four , In secret the Earth around ; And Her secret evermore Shall be show to thee and thy Race .
So it be say and do .
And , deep in the vein of Earth , And , feed by a thousand spring That comfort the market-place , Or sap the power of Kings , The Fifth Great River have birth , Even a it be foretell -- The Secret River of Gold !
And Israel lay down His sceptre and his crown , To brood on that River bank , Where the water flash and sink , And burrow in earth and fell , And bid a season below ; For reason that none might know , Save only Israel .
He be Lord of the Last -- The Fifth , most wonderful , Flood .
He hear Her thunder past And Her song be in his blood .
He can foresay : ` She will fall , ' For he know which fountain dry Behind which desert-belt A thousand league to the South .
He can foresay : ` She will rise . '
He know what far snow melt ; Along what mountain-wall A thousand league to the North .
He snuff the come drought As he snuff the come rain , He know what each will bring forth , And turn it to his gain .
A Prince without a Sword , A Ruler without a Throne ; Israel follow his quest .
In every land a guest , Of many land a lord , In no land King be he .
But the Fifth Great River keep The secret of Her deep For Israel alone , As it be order to be .
The Treasure and the Law Now it be the third week in November , and the wood rang with the noise of pheasant-shooting .
No one hunt that steep , cramped country except the village beagle , who , as often a not , escape from their kennel and make a day of their own .
Dan and Una find a couple of them towling round the kitchen-garden after the laundry cat .
The little brute be only too pleased to go rabbiting , so the child run them all along the brook pasture and into Little Lindens farm-yard , where the old sow vanquish them -- and up to the quarry-hole , where they start a fox .
He head for Far Wood , and there they frighten out all the pheasant , who be shelter from a big beat across the valley .
Then the cruel gun begin again , and they grab the beagle l they should stray and get hurt . '
I would n't be a pheasant -- in November -- for a lot , ' Dan pant , a he catch Folly by the neck .
` Why do you laugh that horrid way ? ' '
I do n't , ' say Una , sit on Flora , the fat lady-dog .
` Oh , look !
The silly bird be go back to their own wood instead of ours , where they would be safe . '
` Safe till it please you to kill them . '
An old man , so tall he be almost a giant , step from behind the clump of holly by Volaterrae .
The child jump , and the dog drop like setter .
He wear a sweeping gown of dark thick stuff , line and edge with yellowish fur , and he bow a bent-down bow that make them feel both proud and ashamed .
Then he look at them steadily , and they star back without doubt or fear .
` You be not afraid ? '
he say , run his hand through his splendid grey beard .
` Not afraid that those men yonder ' -- he jerk his head towards the incessant pop-pop of the gun from the low wood -- ` will do you hurt ? '
` We-ell ' -- Dan like to be accurate , especially when he be shy -- ` old Hobd -- a friend of mine tell me that one of the beater get pepper last week -- hit in the leg , I mean .
You see , Mr Meyer will fire at rabbit .
But he give Waxy Garnett a quid -- sovereign , I mean -- and Waxy tell Hobden he 'd have stand both barrel for half the money . '
` He do n't understand , ' Una cry , watch the pale , troubled face .
` Oh , I wish -- ' She have scarcely say it when Puck rustle out of the holly and speak to the man quickly in foreign word .
Puck wear a long cloak too -- the afternoon be just frost down -- and it change his appearance altogether .
` Nay , nay ! '
he say at last .
` You do not understand the boy .
A freeman be a little hurt , by pure mischance , at the hunting . ' '
I know that mischance !
What do his Lord do ?
Laugh and ride over him ? '
the old man sneer .
` It be one of your own people do the hurt , Kadmiel . '
Puck 's eye twinkle maliciously .
` So he give the freeman a piece of gold , and no more be say . ' '
A Jew draw blood from a Christian and no more be say ? '
Kadmiel cry .
` Never !
When do they torture him ? '
` No man may be bind , or fin , or slay till he have be judge by his peer , ' Puck insist .
` There be but one Law in Old England for Jew or Christian -- the Law that be sign at Runnymede . '
` Why , that 's Magna Charta ! '
Dan whisper .
It be one of the few history date that he could remember .
Kadmiel turn on him with a sweep and a whirr of his spicy-scented gown .
` Dost thou know of that , babe ? '
he cry , and lift his hand in wonder .
` Yes , ' say Dan firmly .
` Magna Charta be sign by John , That Henry the Third put his heel upon .
And old Hobden say that if it have n't be for her -LRB- he call everything `` her '' , you know -RRB- , the keeper would have him clap in Lewes Gaol all the year round . '
Again Puck translate to Kadmiel in the strange , solemn-sounding language , and at last Kadmiel laugh .
` Out of the mouth of babe do we learn , ' say he .
` But tell me now , and I will not call you a babe but a Rabbi , why do the King sign the roll of the New Law at Runnymede ?
For he be a King . '
Dan look sideways at his sister .
It be her turn .
` Because he jolly well have to , ' say Una softly .
` The Barons make him . '
` Nay , ' Kadmiel answer , shake his head .
` You Christians always forget that gold do more than the sword .
Our good King sign because he could not borrow more money from u bad Jews . '
He curve his shoulder a he speak . '
A King without gold be a snake with a broken back , and ' -- his nose sneer up and his eyebrow frown down -- ` it be a good deed to break a snake 's back .
That be my work , ' he cry , triumphantly , to Puck .
` Spirit of Earth , bear witness that that be my work ! '
He shoot up to his full towering height , and his word ring like a trumpet .
He have a voice that change it tone almost a an opal change colour -- sometimes deep and thundery , sometimes thin and waily , but always it make you listen .
` Many people can bear witness to that , ' Puck answer .
` Tell these babes how it be do .
Remember , Master , they do not know Doubt or Fear . '
` So I saw in their face when we meet , ' say Kadmiel .
` Yet surely , surely they be taught to spit upon Jews ? '
` Are they ? '
say Dan , much interested .
` Where at ? '
Puck fell back a pace , laugh .
` Kadmiel be think of King John 's reign , ' he explain .
` His people be badly treat then . '
` Oh , we know that . '
they answer , and -LRB- it be very rude of them , but they could not help it -RRB- they star straight at Kadmiel 's mouth to see if his teeth be all there .
It stick in their lesson-memory that King John use to pull out Jews ' teeth to make them lend him money .
Kadmiel understand the look and smile bitterly .
` No .
Your King never draw my teeth : I think , perhaps , I draw his .
Listen !
I be not bear among Christians , but among Moors -- in Spain -- in a little white town under the mountain .
Yes , the Moors be cruel , but at least their learn men dare to think .
It be prophesy of me at my birth that I should be a Lawgiver to a People of a strange speech and a hard language .
We Jews be always look for the Prince and the Lawgiver to come .
Why not ?
My people in the town -LRB- we be very few -RRB- set me apart a a child of the prophecy -- the Chosen of the Chosen .
We Jews dream so many dream .
You would never guess it to see u slink about the rubbish-heaps in our quarter ; but at the day 's end -- door shut , candle light -- aha !
then we become the Chosen again . '
He pace back and forth through the wood a he talk .
The rattle of the shot-guns never cease , and the dog whimper a little and lay flat on the leaf . '
I be a Prince .
Yes !
Think of a little Prince who have never know rough word in his own house hand over to shout , beard Rabbis , who pull his ear and filliped his nose , all that he might learn -- learn -- learn to be King when his time come .
Hé !
Such a little Prince it be !
One eye he keep on the stone-throwing Moorish boy , and the other it rove about the street look for his Kingdom .
Yes , and he learn to cry softly when he be hunt up and down those street .
He learn to do all thing without noise .
He play beneath his father 's table when the Great Candle be light , and he listen a child listen to the talk of his father 's friend above the table .
They come across the mountain , from out of all the world , for my Prince 's father be their counsellor .
They come from behind the army of Sala-ud-Din : from Rome : from Venice : from England .
They steal down our alley , they tap secretly at our door , they take off their rag , they array themselves , and they talk to my father at the wine .
All over the world the heathen fought each other .
They bring news of these war , and while he play beneath the table , my Prince heard these meanly dressed one decide between themselves how , and when , and for how long King should draw sword against King , and People rise up against People .
Why not ?
There can be no war without gold , and we Jews know how the earth 's gold move with the season , and the crop , and the wind ; circle and loop and rise and sink away like a river -- a wonderful underground river .
How should the foolish Kings know that while they fight and steal and kill ? '
The child 's face show that they know nothing at all a , with open eye , they trot and turn beside the long-striding old man .
He twitch his gown over his shoulder , and a square plate of gold , stud with jewel , gleam for an instant through the fur , like a star through fly snow .
` No matter , ' he say .
` But , credit me , my Prince saw peace or war decide not once , but many time , by the fall of a coin spun between a Jew from Bury and a Jewess from Alexandria , in his father 's house , when the Great Candle be light .
Such power have we Jews among the Gentiles .
Ah , my little Prince !
Do you wonder that he learn quickly ?
Why not ? '
He mutter to himself and go on : -- ` My trade be that of a physician .
When I have learn it in Spain I go to the East to find my Kingdom .
Why not ?
A Jew be as free a a sparrow -- or a dog .
He go where he be hunt .
In the East I find library where men dare to think -- school of medicine where they dare to learn .
I be diligent in my business .
Therefore I stand before Kings .
I have be a brother to Princes and a companion to beggar , and I have walk between the living and the dead .
There be no profit in it .
I do not find my Kingdom .
So , in the tenth year of my travel , when I have reach the Uttermost Eastern Sea , I return to my father 's house .
God have wonderfully preserve my people .
None have be slain , none even wound , and only a few scourged .
I become once more a son in my father 's house .
Again the Great Candle be light ; again the meanly apparelled one tap on our door after dusk ; and again I hear them weigh out peace and war , a they weigh out the gold on the table .
But I be not rich -- not very rich .
Therefore , when those that have power and knowledge and wealth talk together , I sit in the shadow .
Why not ?
` Yet all my wandering have show me one sure thing , which be , that a King without money be like a spear without a head .
He can not do much harm .
I say , therefore , to Elias of Bury , a great one among our people : `` Why do our people lend any more to the Kings that oppress u ? ''
`` Because , '' say Elias , `` if we refuse they stir up their people against u , and the People be tenfold more cruel than Kings .
If thou doubtest , come with me to Bury in England and live a I live . '' '
I saw my mother 's face across the candle flame , and I say , `` I will come with thee to Bury .
Maybe my Kingdom shall be there . ''
` So I sail with Elias to the darkness and the cruelty of Bury in England , where there be no learned men .
How can a man be wise if he hate ?
At Bury I keep his account for Elias , and I saw men kill Jews there by the tower .
No -- none lay hand on Elias .
He lend money to the King , and the King 's favour be about him .
A King will not take the life so long a there be any gold .
This King -- yes , John -- oppress his people bitterly because they would not give him money .
Yet his land be a good land .
If he have only give it rest he might have crop it a a Christian crop his beard .
But even that little he do not know , for God have deprive him of all understanding , and have multiply pestilence , and famine , and despair upon the people .
Therefore his people turn against u Jews , who be all people 's dog .
Why not ?
Lastly the Barons and the people rise together against the King because of his cruelty .
Nay -- nay -- the Barons do not love the people , but they saw that if the King cut up and destroy the common people , he would presently destroy the Barons .
They join then , a cat and pig will join to slay a snake .
I keep the account , and I watch all these thing , for I remember the Prophecy . '
A great gathering of Barons -LRB- to most of whom we have lent money -RRB- come to Bury , and there , after much talk and a thousand runnings-about , they make a roll of the New Laws that they would force on the King .
If he swear to keep those Laws , they would allow him a little money .
That be the King 's God -- Money -- to waste .
They show u the roll of the New Laws .
Why not ?
We have lend them money .
We know all their counsel -- we Jews shiver behind our door in Bury . '
He throw out his hand suddenly .
` We do not seek to be pay all in money .
We seek Power -- Power -- Power !
That be our God in our captivity .
Power to use ! '
I say to Elias : `` These New Laws be good .
Lend no more money to the King : so long a he have money he will lie and slay the people . '' '
`` Nay , '' say Elias .
`` I know this people .
They be madly cruel .
Better one King than a thousand butcher .
I have lend a little money to the Barons , or they would torture u , but my most I will lend to the King .
He hath promise me a place near him at Court , where my wife and I shall be safe . '' '
`` But if the King be make to keep these New Laws , '' I say , `` the land will have peace , and our trade will grow .
If we lend he will fight again . '' '
`` Who make thee a Lawgiver in England ? ''
say Elias .
`` I know this people .
Let the dog tear one another !
I will lend the King ten thousand piece of gold , and he can fight the Barons at his pleasure . '' '
`` There be not two thousand piece of gold in all England this summer , '' I say , for I keep the account , and I know how the earth 's gold move -- that wonderful underground river .
Elias bar home the window , and , his hand about his mouth , he tell me how , when he be trade with small ware in a French ship , he have come to the Castle of Pevensey . '
` Oh ! '
say Dan .
` Pevensey again ! '
and look at Una , who nod and skip .
` There , after they have scatter his pack up and down the Great Hall , some young knight carry him to an upper room , and drop him into a well in a wall , that rise and fell with the tide .
They call him Joseph , and throw torch at his wet head .
Why not ? '
` Why , of course ! '
cry Dan .
` Did n't you know it be -- ' Puck hold up his hand to stop him , and Kadmiel , who never notice , go on .
` When the tide drop he think he stand on old armour , but feel with his toe , he rake up bar on bar of soft gold .
Some wicked treasure of the old day put away , and the secret cut off by the sword .
I have hear the like before . '
` So have we , ' Una whisper .
` But it be n't wicked a bit . '
` Elias take a little of the stuff with him , and thrice yearly he would return to Pevensey a a chapman , sell at no price or profit , till they suffer him to sleep in the empty room , where he would plumb and grope , and steal away a few bar .
The great store of it still remain , and by long brood he have come to look on it a his own .
Yet when we think how we should lift and convey it , we saw no way .
This be before the Word of the Lord have come to me .
A walled fortress possess by Normans ; in the midst a forty-foot tide-well out of which to remove secretly many horse-loads of gold !
Hopeless !
So Elias wept .
Adah , his wife , weep too .
She have hop to stand beside the Queen 's Christian tiring-maids at Court when the King should give them that place at Court which he have promise .
Why not ?
She be bear in England -- an odious woman .
` The present evil to u be that Elias , out of his strong folly , have , a it be , promise the King that he would arm him with more gold .
Wherefore the King in his camp stop his ear against the Barons and the people .
Wherefore men die daily .
Adah so desire her place at Court , she beseech Elias to tell the King where the treasure lay , that the King might take it by force , and -- they would trust in his gratitude .
Why not ?
This Elias refuse to do , for he look on the gold a his own .
They quarrel , and they weep at the evening meal , and late in the night come one Langton -- a priest , almost learn -- to borrow more money for the Barons .
Elias and Adah go to their chamber . '
Kadmiel laugh scornfully in his beard .
The shot across the valley stop a the shoot party change their ground for the last beat .
` So it be I , not Elias , ' he go on quietly , ` that make term with Langton touch the fortieth of the New Laws . '
` What term ? '
say Puck quickly .
` The Fortieth of the Great Charter say : `` To none will we sell , refuse , or delay right or justice . '' '
` True , but the Barons have write first : To no free man .
It cost me two hundred broad piece of gold to change those narrow word .
Langton , the priest , understood .
`` Jew though thou art , '' say he , `` the change be just , and if ever Christian and Jew come to be equal in England thy people may thank thee . ''
Then he go out stealthily , a men do who deal with Israel by night .
I think he spend my gift upon his altar .
Why not ?
I have speak with Langton .
He be such a man a I might have be if -- if we Jews have be a people .
But yet , in many thing , a child . '
I hear Elias and Adah abovestairs quarrel , and , know the woman be the strong , I saw that Elias would tell the King of the gold and that the King would continue in his stubbornness .
Therefore I saw that the gold must be put away from the reach of any man .
Of a sudden , the Word of the Lord come to me say , `` The Morning be come , O thou that dwellest in the land . '' '
Kadmiel halt , all black against the pale green sky beyond the wood -- a huge robed figure , like the Moses in the picture-Bible . '
I rise .
I go out , and a I shut the door on that House of Foolishness , the woman look from the window and whisper , `` I have prevail on my husband to tell the King ! ''
I answer : `` There be no need .
The Lord be with me . ''
` In that hour the Lord give me full understanding of all that I must do ; and His Hand cover me in my way .
First I go to London , to a physician of our people , who sell me certain drug that I need .
You shall see why .
Thence I go swiftly to Pevensey .
Men fight all around me , for there be neither ruler nor judge in the abominable land .
Yet when I walk by them they cry out that I be one Ahasuerus , a Jew , condemn , a they believe , to live for ever , and they flee from me everyways .
Thus the Lord save me for my work , and at Pevensey I buy me a little boat and moor it on the mud beneath the Marsh-gate of the Castle .
That also God show me . '
He be as calm a though he be speak of some stranger , and his voice fill the little bare wood with rolling music . '
I cast ' -- his hand go to his breast , and again the strange jewel gleam -- ' I cast the drug which I have prepare into the common well of the Castle .
Nay , I do no harm .
The more we physician know , the less do we do .
Only the fool say : `` I dare . ''
I cause a blotched and itch rash to break out upon their skin , but I know it would fade in fifteen day .
I do not stretch out my hand against their life .
They in the Castle think it be the Plague , and they run out , take with them their very dogs . '
A Christian physician , see that I be a Jew and a stranger , vow that I have bring the sickness from London .
This be the one time I have ever hear a Christian leech speak truth of any disease .
Thereupon the people beat me , but a merciful woman say : `` Do not kill him now .
Push him into our Castle with his Plague , and if , a he say , it will abate on the fifteenth day , we can kill him then . ''
Why not ?
They drive me across the drawbridge of the Castle , and flee back to their booth .
Thus I come to be alone with the treasure . '
` But do you know this be all go to happen just right ? '
say Una .
` My Prophecy be that I should be a Lawgiver to a People of a strange land and a hard speech .
I know I should not die .
I wash my cut .
I find the tide-well in the wall , and from Sabbath to Sabbath I dive and dig there in that empty , Christian-smelling fortress .
Hé !
I spoil the Egyptians !
Hé !
If they have only know !
I draw up many good load of gold , which I load by night into my boat .
There have be gold-dust too , but that have be wash out by the tide . '
` Did n't you ever wonder who have put it there ? '
say Dan , steal a glance at Puck 's calm , dark face under the hood of his gown .
Puck shake his head and purse his lip .
` Often ; for the gold be new to me , ' Kadmiel reply . '
I know the Golds .
I can judge them in the dark ; but this be heavy and red than any we deal in .
Perhaps it be the very gold of Parvaim .
Eh , why not ?
It go to my heart to heave it on to the mud , but I saw well that if the evil thing remain , or if even the hope of find it remain , the King would not sign the New Laws , and the land would perish . '
` Oh , Marvel ! '
say Puck , beneath his breath , rustle in the dead leaf .
` When the boat be load I wash my hand seven time , and par beneath my nail , for I would not keep one grain .
I go out by the little gate where the Castle 's refuse be throw .
I dare not hoist sail l men should see me ; but the Lord command the tide to bear me carefully , and I be far from land before the morning . '
` Were n't you afraid ? '
say Una .
` Why ?
There be no Christians in the boat .
At sunrise I make my prayer , and cast the gold -- all -- all that gold -- into the deep sea !
A King 's ransom -- no , the ransom of a People !
When I have loose hold of the last bar , the Lord command the tide to return me to a haven at the mouth of a river , and thence I walk across a wilderness to Lewes , where I have brother .
They open the door to me , and they say -- I have not eat for two day -- they say that I fell across the threshold , cry : `` I have sink an army with horseman in the sea ! '' '
` But you have n't , ' say Una .
` Oh , yes !
I see !
You mean that King John might have spend it on that ? '
` Even so , ' say Kadmiel .
The firing break out again close behind them .
The pheasant pour over the top of a belt of tall fir .
They could see young Mr Meyer , in his new yellow gaiter , very busy and excite at the end of the line , and they could hear the thud of the fall bird .
` But what do Elias of Bury do ? '
Puck demand .
` He have promise money to the King . '
Kadmiel smile grimly . '
I send him word from London that the Lord be on my side .
When he hear that the Plague have break out in Pevensey , and that a Jew have be thrust into the Castle to cure it , he understand my word be true .
He and Adah hurry to Lewes and ask me for an accounting .
He still look on the gold a his own .
I tell them where I have lay it , and I give them full leave to pick it up ... Eh , well !
The curse of a fool and the dust of a journey be two thing no wise man can escape ... But I pity Elias !
The King be wroth with him because he could not lend ; the Barons be wroth too because they hear that he would have lent to the King ; and Adah be wroth with him because she be an odious woman .
They take ship from Lewes to Spain .
That be wise ! '
` And you ?
Did you see the signing of the Law at Runnymede ? '
say Puck , a Kadmiel laugh noiselessly .
` Nay .
Who be I to meddle with thing too high for me ?
I return to Bury , and lent money on the autumn crop .
Why not ? '
There be a crackle overhead .
A cock-pheasant that have sheer aside after be hit spatter down almost on top of them , drive up the dry leaf like a shell .
Flora and Folly throw themselves at it ; the child rush forward , and when they have beat them off and smooth down the plumage Kadmiel have disappear .
` Well , ' say Puck calmly , ` what do you think of it ?
Weland give the Sword !
The Sword give the Treasure , and the Treasure give the Law .
It 's as natural a an oak grow . ' '
I do n't understand .
Did n't he know it be Sir Richard 's old treasure ? '
say Dan .
` And why do Sir Richard and Brother Hugh leave it lie about ?
And -- and -- ' ` Never mind , ' say Una politely .
` He 'll let u come and go and look and know another time .
Wo n't you , Puck ? '
` Another time maybe , ' Puck answer .
` Brr !
It 's cold -- and late .
I 'll race you towards home ! '
They hurry down into the sheltered valley .
The sun have almost sink behind Cherry Clack , the trodden ground by the cattle-gates be freeze at the edge , and the new-waked north wind blow the night on them from over the hill .
They pick up their foot and fly across the browned pasture , and when they halt , pant in the steam of their own breath , the dead leaf whirl up behind them .
There be Oak and Ash and Thorn enough in that year-end shower to magic away a thousand memory .
So they trot to the brook at the bottom of the lawn , wonder why Flora and Folly have miss the quarry-hole fox .
Old Hobden be just finish some hedge-work .
They saw his white smock glimmer in the twilight where he faggot the rubbish .
` Winter , he 's come , I reckon , Mus ' Dan , ' he call .
` Hard time now till Heffle Cuckoo Fair .
Yes , we 'll all be glad to see the Old Woman let the Cuckoo out o ' the basket for to start lawful Spring in England . '
They hear a crash , and a stamp and a splash of water a though a heavy old cow be cross almost under their nose .
Hobden run forward angrily to the ford .
` Gleason 's bull again , playin ' Robin all over the Farm !
Oh , look , Mus ' Dan -- his great footmark as big a a trencher .
No bound to his impidence !
He might count himself to be a man or -- or Somebody -- ' A voice the other side of the brook boom : ' I wonder who his cloak would turn When Puck have lead him round , Or where those walking fire would burn -- ' Then the child go in sing ` Farewell Rewards and Fairies ' at the top of their voice .
They have forget that they have not even say good-night to Puck .
THE CHILDREN 'S SONG Land of our Birth , we pledge to thee Our love and toil in the year to be ; When we be grown and take our place , As men and woman with our race .
Father in Heaven Who lovest all , Oh , help Thy child when they call ; That they may build from age to age , An undefiled heritage .
Teach u to bear the yoke in youth , With steadfastness and careful truth ; That , in our time , Thy Grace may give The Truth whereby the Nations live .
Teach u to rule ourselves alway , Controlled and cleanly night and day ; That we may bring , if need arise , No maim or worthless sacrifice .
Teach u to look in all our end , On Thee for judge , and not our friend ; That we , with Thee , may walk uncowed By fear or favour of the crowd .
Teach u the Strength that can not seek , By deed or thought , to hurt the weak ; That , under Thee , we may possess Man 's strength to comfort man 's distress .
Teach u Delight in simple thing , And Mirth that have no bitter spring ; Forgiveness free of evil do , And Love to all men ` neath the sun !

HOW FEAR CAME The stream be shrink -- the pool be dry , And we be comrade , thou and I ; With fevered jowl and dusty flank Each jostle each along the bank ; And by one drouthy fear make still , Forgoing thought of quest or kill .
Now ` neath his dam the fawn may see , The lean Pack-wolf as cow a he , And the tall buck , unflinching , note The fang that tear his father 's throat .
The pool be shrink -- the stream be dry , And we be playmate , thou and I , Till yonder cloud -- Good Hunting !
-- loose The rain that break our Water Truce .
The Law of the Jungle -- which be by far the old law in the world -- have arrange for almost every kind of accident that may befall the Jungle People , till now it code be as perfect a time and custom can make it .
You will remember that Mowgli spend a great part of his life in the Seeonee Wolf-Pack , learn the Law from Baloo , the Brown Bear ; and it be Baloo who tell him , when the boy grow impatient at the constant order , that the Law be like the Giant Creeper , because it drop across every one 's back and no one could escape .
`` When thou hast live as long a I have , Little Brother , thou wilt see how all the Jungle obeys at least one Law .
And that will be no pleasant sight , '' say Baloo .
This talk go in at one ear and out at the other , for a boy who spend his life eating and sleeping do not worry about anything till it actually star him in the face .
But , one year , Baloo 's word come true , and Mowgli saw all the Jungle work under the Law .
It begin when the winter Rains fail almost entirely , and Ikki , the Porcupine , meet Mowgli in a bamboo-thicket , tell him that the wild yam be dry up .
Now everybody know that Ikki be ridiculously fastidious in his choice of food , and will eat nothing but the very best and ripest .
So Mowgli laugh and say , `` What be that to me ? ''
`` Not much NOW , '' say Ikki , rattle his quill in a stiff , uncomfortable way , `` but later we shall see .
Is there any more diving into the deep rock-pool below the Bee-Rocks , Little Brother ? ''
`` No .
The foolish water be go all away , and I do not wish to break my head , '' say Mowgli , who , in those day , be quite sure that he know as much a any five of the Jungle People put together .
`` That be thy loss .
A small crack might let in some wisdom . ''
Ikki duck quickly to prevent Mowgli from pull his nose-bristles , and Mowgli tell Baloo what Ikki have say .
Baloo look very grave , and mumble half to himself : `` If I be alone I would change my hunting-grounds now , before the others begin to think .
And yet -- hunt among stranger end in fighting ; and they might hurt the Man-cub .
We must wait and see how the mohwa bloom . ''
That spring the mohwa tree , that Baloo be so fond of , never flower .
The greeny , cream-coloured , waxy blossom be heat-killed before they be bear , and only a few bad-smelling petal come down when he stand on his hind leg and shake the tree .
Then , inch by inch , the untempered heat crept into the heart of the Jungle , turn it yellow , brown , and at last black .
The green growth in the side of the ravine burn up to break wire and curl film of dead stuff ; the hidden pool sink down and cake over , keep the last least footmark on their edge a if it have be cast in iron ; the juicy-stemmed creeper fell away from the tree they cling to and die at their foot ; the bamboo wither , clank when the hot wind blow , and the moss peel off the rock deep in the Jungle , till they be a bare and as hot a the quiver blue boulder in the bed of the stream .
The bird and the monkey-people go north early in the year , for they know what be come ; and the deer and the wild pig break far away to the perished field of the village , die sometimes before the eye of men too weak to kill them .
Chil , the Kite , stay and grow fat , for there be a great deal of carrion , and even after even he bring the news to the beast , too weak to force their way to fresh hunting-grounds , that the sun be kill the Jungle for three day ' flight in every direction .
Mowgli , who have never know what real hunger meant , fell back on stale honey , three year old , scrap out of deserted rock-hives -- honey black a a sloe , and dusty with dried sugar .
He hunt , too , for deep-boring grub under the bark of the tree , and rob the wasp of their new brood .
All the game in the jungle be no more than skin and bone , and Bagheera could kill thrice in a night , and hardly get a full meal .
But the want of water be the bad , for though the Jungle People drink seldom they must drink deep .
And the heat go on and on , and suck up all the moisture , till at last the main channel of the Waingunga be the only stream that carry a trickle of water between it dead bank ; and when Hathi , the wild elephant , who live for a hundred year and more , saw a long , lean blue ridge of rock show dry in the very centre of the stream , he know that he be look at the Peace Rock , and then and there he lift up his trunk and proclaim the Water Truce , a his father before him have proclaim it fifty year ago .
The deer , wild pig , and buffalo take up the cry hoarsely ; and Chil , the Kite , fly in great circle far and wide , whistle and shriek the warning .
By the Law of the Jungle it be death to kill at the drinking-places when once the Water Truce have be declare .
The reason of this be that drink come before eat .
Every one in the Jungle can scramble along somehow when only game be scarce ; but water be water , and when there be but one source of supply , all hunt stop while the Jungle People go there for their need .
In good season , when water be plentiful , those who come down to drink at the Waingunga -- or anywhere else , for that matter -- do so at the risk of their life , and that risk make no small part of the fascination of the night 's doings .
To move down so cunningly that never a leaf stir ; to wade knee-deep in the roaring shallow that drown all noise from behind ; to drink , look backward over one shoulder , every muscle ready for the first desperate bound of keen terror ; to roll on the sandy margin , and return , wet-muzzled and well plump out , to the admire herd , be a thing that all tall-antlered young buck take a delight in , precisely because they know that at any moment Bagheera or Shere Khan might leap upon them and bear them down .
But now all that life-and-death fun be end , and the Jungle People come up , starve and weary , to the shrink river , -- tiger , bear , deer , buffalo , and pig , all together , -- drink the fouled water , and hung above them , too exhaust to move off .
The deer and the pig have tramp all day in search of something well than dry bark and wither leaf .
The buffalo have find no wallow to be cool in , and no green crop to steal .
The snake have leave the Jungle and come down to the river in the hope of find a stray frog .
They curl round wet stone , and never offer to strike when the nose of a rooting pig dislodge them .
The river-turtles have long ago be kill by Bagheera , cleverest of hunter , and the fish have bury themselves deep in the dry mud .
Only the Peace Rock lay across the shallow like a long snake , and the little tired ripple hiss a they dry on it hot side .
It be here that Mowgli come nightly for the cool and the companionship .
The most hungry of his enemy would hardly have care for the boy then , His naked hide make him seem more lean and wretched than any of his fellow .
His hair be bleach to tow colour by the sun ; his rib stand out like the rib of a basket , and the lump on his knee and elbow , where he be use to track on all four , give his shrunken limbs the look of knot grass-stems .
But his eye , under his matted forelock , be cool and quiet , for Bagheera be his adviser in this time of trouble , and tell him to go quietly , hunt slowly , and never , on any account , to lose his temper .
`` It be an evil time , '' say the Black Panther , one furnace-hot evening , `` but it will go if we can live till the end .
Is thy stomach full , Man-cub ? ''
`` There be stuff in my stomach , but I get no good of it .
Think you , Bagheera , the Rains have forget u and will never come again ? ''
`` Not I !
We shall see the mohwa in blossom yet , and the little fawns all fat with new grass .
Come down to the Peace Rock and hear the news .
On my back , Little Brother . ''
`` This be no time to carry weight .
I can still stand alone , but -- indeed we be no fatted bullock , we two . ''
Bagheera look along his ragged , dusty flank and whisper .
`` Last night I kill a bullock under the yoke .
So low be I bring that I think I should not have dare to spring if he have be loose .
WOU ! ''
Mowgli laugh .
`` Yes , we be great hunter now , '' say he .
`` I be very bold -- to eat grub , '' and the two come down together through the crackling undergrowth to the river-bank and the lace-work of shoal that run out from it in every direction .
`` The water can not live long , '' say Baloo , join them .
`` Look across .
Yonder be trail like the road of Man . ''
On the level plain of the farther bank the stiff jungle-grass have die standing , and , die , have mummied .
The beaten track of the deer and the pig , all head toward the river , have strip that colourless plain with dusty gully drive through the ten-foot grass , and , early a it be , each long avenue be full of first-comers hasten to the water .
You could hear the do and fawn coughing in the snuff-like dust .
Up-stream , at the bend of the sluggish pool round the Peace Rock , and Warden of the Water Truce , stand Hathi , the wild elephant , with his son , gaunt and gray in the moonlight , rock to and fro -- always rocking .
Below him a little be the vanguard of the deer ; below these , again , the pig and the wild buffalo ; and on the opposite bank , where the tall tree come down to the water 's edge , be the place set apart for the Eaters of Flesh -- the tiger , the wolf , the panther , the bear , and the others .
`` We be under one Law , indeed , '' say Bagheera , wad into the water and look across at the line of click horn and start eye where the deer and the pig push each other to and fro .
`` Good hunting , all you of my blood , '' he add , lie own at full length , one flank thrust out of the shallow ; and then , between his teeth , `` But for that which be the Law it would be VERY good hunting . ''
The quick-spread ear of the deer catch the last sentence , and a frightened whisper run along the rank .
`` The Truce !
Remember the Truce ! ''
`` Peace there , peace ! ''
gurgle Hathi , the wild elephant .
`` The Truce hold , Bagheera .
This be no time to talk of hunting . ''
`` Who should know good than I ? ''
Bagheera answer , roll his yellow eye up-stream .
`` I be an eater of turtle -- a fisher of frog .
Ngaayah !
Would I could get good from chew branch ! ''
`` WE wish so , very greatly , '' bleat a young fawn , who have only be bear that spring , and do not at all like it .
Wretched a the Jungle People be , even Hathi could not help chuckling ; while Mowgli , lie on his elbow in the warm water , laugh aloud , and beat up the scum with his foot .
`` Well speak , little bud-horn , '' Bagheera purr .
`` When the Truce end that shall be remember in thy favour , '' and he look keenly through the darkness to make sure of recognise the fawn again .
Gradually the talk spread up and down the drinking-places .
One could hear the scuffling , snort pig ask for more room ; the buffalo grunt among themselves a they lurch out across the sand-bars , and the deer tell pitiful story of their long foot-sore wandering in quest of food .
Now and again they ask some question of the Eaters of Flesh across the river , but all the news be bad , and the roaring hot wind of the Jungle come and go between the rock and the rattling branch , and scatter twig , and dust on the water .
`` The men-folk , too , they die beside their plough , '' say a young sambhur .
`` I pass three between sunset and night .
They lay still , and their Bullocks with them .
We also shall lie still in a little . ''
`` The river have fall since last night , '' say Baloo .
`` O Hathi , hast thou ever see the like of this drought ? ''
`` It will pass , it will pass , '' say Hathi , squirt water along his back and side .
`` We have one here that can not endure long , '' say Baloo ; and he look toward the boy he love .
`` I ? ''
say Mowgli indignantly , sit up in the water .
`` I have no long fur to cover my bone , but -- but if THY hide be take off , Baloo -- '' Hathi shake all over at the idea , and Baloo say severely : `` Man-cub , that be not seemly to tell a Teacher of the Law .
Never have I be see without my hide . ''
`` Nay , I mean no harm , Baloo ; but only that thou art , a it be , like the cocoanut in the husk , and I be the same cocoanut all naked .
Now that brown husk of thine -- '' Mowgli be sit cross-legged , and explain thing with his forefinger in his usual way , when Bagheera put out a paddy paw and pull him over backward into the water .
`` Worse and bad , '' say the Black Panther , a the boy rise splutter .
`` First Baloo be to be skin , and now he be a cocoanut .
Be careful that he do not do what the ripe cocoanut do . ''
`` And what be that ? ''
say Mowgli , off his guard for the minute , though that be one of the old catch in the Jungle .
`` Break thy head , '' say Bagheera quietly , pull him under again .
`` It be not good to make a jest of thy teacher , '' say the bear , when Mowgli have be duck for the third time .
`` Not good !
What would ye have ?
That naked thing run to and fro make a monkey-jest of those who have once be good hunter , and pull the best of u by the whisker for sport . ''
This be Shere Khan , the Lame Tiger , limp down to the water .
He wait a little to enjoy the sensation he make among the deer on the opposite to lap , growling : `` The jungle have become a whelping-ground for naked cub now .
Look at me , Man-cub ! ''
Mowgli look -- star , rather -- as insolently a he know how , and in a minute Shere Khan turn away uneasily .
`` Man-cub this , and Man-cub that , '' he rumble , go on with his drink , `` the cub be neither man nor cub , or he would have be afraid .
Next season I shall have to beg his leave for a drink .
Augrh ! ''
`` That may come , too , '' say Bagheera , look him steadily between the eye .
`` That may come , too -- Faugh , Shere Khan !
-- what new shame hast thou bring here ? ''
The Lame Tiger have dip his chin and jowl in the water , and dark , oily streak be float from it down-stream .
`` Man ! ''
say Shere Khan coolly , `` I kill an hour since . ''
He go on purring and growl to himself .
The line of beast shake and waver to and fro , and a whisper go up that grow to a cry .
`` Man !
Man !
He have kill Man ! ''
Then all look towards Hathi , the wild elephant , but he seem not to hear .
Hathi never do anything till the time come , and that be one of the reason why he live so long .
`` At such a season a this to kill Man !
Was no other game afoot ? ''
say Bagheera scornfully , draw himself out of the tainted water , and shake each paw , cat-fashion , a he do so .
`` I kill for choice -- not for food . ''
The horrified whisper begin again , and Hathi 's watchful little white eye cock itself in Shere Khan 's direction .
`` For choice , '' Shere Khan drawl .
`` Now come I to drink and make me clean again .
Is there any to forbid ? ''
Bagheera 's back begin to curve like a bamboo in a high wind , but Hathi lift up his trunk and speak quietly .
`` Thy kill be from choice ? ''
he ask ; and when Hathi ask a question it be best to answer .
`` Even so .
It be my right and my Night .
Thou knowest , O Hathi . ''
Shere Khan speak almost courteously .
`` Yes , I know , '' Hathi answer ; and , after a little silence , `` Hast thou drunk thy fill ? ''
`` For to-night , yes . ''
`` Go , then .
The river be to drink , and not to defile .
None but the Lame Tiger would so have boast of his right at this season when -- when we suffer together -- Man and Jungle People alike .
Clean or unclean , get to thy lair , Shere Khan ! ''
The last word ring out like silver trumpet , and Hathi 's three son roll forward half a pace , though there be no need .
Shere Khan slink away , not dare to growl , for he know -- what every one else know -- that when the last come to the last , Hathi be the Master of the Jungle .
`` What be this right Shere Khan speaks of ? ''
Mowgli whisper in Bagheera 's ear .
`` To kill Man be always , shameful .
The Law say so .
And yet Hathi say -- '' `` Ask him .
I do not know , Little Brother .
Right or no right , if Hathi have not speak I would have teach that lame butcher his lesson .
To come to the Peace Rock fresh from a kill of Man -- and to boast of it -- be a jackal 's trick .
Besides , he taint the good water . ''
Mowgli wait for a minute to pick up his courage , because no one care to address Hathi directly , and then he cry : `` What be Shere Khan 's right , O Hathi ? ''
Both bank echo his word , for all the People of the Jungle be intensely curious , and they have just see something that none except Baloo , who look very thoughtful , seem to understand .
`` It be an old tale , '' say Hathi ; `` a tale old than the Jungle .
Keep silence along the bank and I will tell that tale . ''
There be a minute or two of push a shouldering among the pig and the buffalo , and then the leader of the herd grunt , one after another , `` We wait , '' and Hathi strode forward , till he be nearly knee-deep in the pool by the Peace Rock .
Lean and wrinkled and yellow-tusked though he be , he look what the Jungle know him to be -- their master .
`` Ye know , child , '' he begin , `` that of all thing ye most fear Man ; '' and there be a mutter of agreement .
`` This tale touch thee , Little Brother , '' say Bagheera to Mowgli .
`` I ?
I be of the Pack -- a hunter of the Free People , '' Mowgli answer .
`` What have I to do with Man ? ''
`` And ye do not know why ye fear Man ? ''
Hathi go on .
`` This be the reason .
In the beginning of the Jungle , and none know when that be , we of the Jungle walk together , have no fear of one another .
In those day there be no drought , and leaf and flower and fruit grow on the same tree , and we eat nothing at all except leaf and flower and grass and fruit and bark . ''
`` I be glad I be not bear in those day , '' say Bagheera .
`` Bark be only good to sharpen claw . ''
`` And the Lord of the Jungle be Tha , the First of the Elephants .
He draw the Jungle out of deep water with his trunk ; and where he make furrow in the ground with his tusk , there the river run ; and where he strike with his foot , there rise pond of good water ; and when he blow through his trunk , -- thus , -- the tree fell .
That be the manner in which the Jungle be make by Tha ; and so the tale be tell to me . ''
`` It have not lose fat in the telling , '' Bagheera whisper , and Mowgli laugh behind his hand .
`` In those day there be no corn or melon or pepper or sugar-cane , nor be there any little hut such a ye have all see ; and the Jungle People know nothing of Man , but live in the Jungle together , make one people .
But presently they begin to dispute over their food , though there be graze enough for all .
They be lazy .
Each wish to eat where he lay , a sometimes we can do now when the spring rain be good .
Tha , the First of the Elephants , be busy make new jungle and lead the river in their bed .
He could not walk in all place ; therefore he make the First of the Tigers the master and the judge of the Jungle , to whom the Jungle People should bring their dispute .
In those day the First of the Tigers ate fruit and grass with the others .
He be as large a I be , and he be very beautiful , in colour all over like the blossom of the yellow creeper .
There be never stripe nor bar upon his hide in those good day when this the Jungle be new .
All the Jungle People come before him without fear , and his word be the Law of all the Jungle .
We be then , remember ye , one people .
`` Yet upon a night there be a dispute between two buck -- a grazing-quarrel such a ye now settle with the horn and the fore-feet -- and it be say that a the two speak together before the First of the First of the Tigers lying among the flower , a buck push him with his horn , and the First of the Tigers forget that he be the master and judge of the Jungle , and , leap upon that buck , break his neck .
`` Till that night never one of u have die , and the First of the Tigers , see what he have do , and be make foolish by the scent of the blood , run away into the marsh of the North , and we of the Jungle , leave without a judge , fell to fight among ourselves ; and Tha hear the noise of it and come back .
Then some of u say this and some of u say that , but he saw the dead buck among the flower , and ask who have kill , and we of the Jungle would not tell because the smell of the blood make u foolish .
We run to and fro in circle , caper and cry out and shake our head .
Then Tha give an order to the tree that hang low , and to the trail creeper of the Jungle , that they should mark the killer of the buck so that he should know him again , and he say , ` Who will now be master of the Jungle People ? '
Then up leap the Gray Ape who live in the branch , and say , ' I will now be master of the Jungle . ' ''
At this Tha laugh , and say , `` So be it , '' and go away very angry .
`` Children , ye know the Gray Ape .
He be then a he be now .
At the first he make a wise face for himself , but in a little while he begin to scratch and to leap up and down , and when Tha come back he find the Gray Ape hanging , head down , from a bough , mock those who stand below ; and they mock him again .
And so there be no Law in the Jungle -- only foolish talk and senseless word .
`` Then Tha call u all together and say : ` The first of your master have bring Death into the Jungle , and the second Shame .
Now it be time there be a Law , and a Law that ye must not break .
Now ye shall know Fear , and when ye have find him ye shall know that he be your master , and the rest shall follow . '
Then we of the jungle say , ` What be Fear ? '
And Tha say , ` Seek till ye find . '
So we go up and down the Jungle seek for Fear , and presently the buffalo -- '' `` Ugh ! ''
say Mysa , the leader of the buffalo , from their sand-bank .
`` Yes , Mysa , it be the buffalo .
They come back with the news that in a cave in the Jungle sit Fear , and that he have no hair , and go upon his hind leg .
Then we of the Jungle follow the herd till we come to that cave , and Fear stand at the mouth of it , and he be , a the buffalo have say , hairless , and he walk upon his hinder leg .
When he saw u he cry out , and his voice fill u with the fear that we have now of that voice when we hear it , and we run away , tramp upon and tear each other because we be afraid .
That night , so it be tell to me , we of the Jungle do not lie down together a use to be our custom , but each tribe draw off by itself -- the pig with the pig , the deer with the deer ; horn to horn , hoof to hoof , -- like keep to like , and so lay shaking in the Jungle .
`` Only the First of the Tigers be not with u , for he be still hide in the marsh of the North , and when word be bring to him of the Thing we have see in the cave , he say . '
I will go to this Thing and break his neck . '
So he run all the night till he come to the cave ; but the tree and the creeper on his path , remember the order that Tha have give , let down their branch and mark him a he run , draw their finger across his back , his flank , his forehead , and his jowl .
Wherever they touch him there be a mark and a stripe upon his yellow hide .
AND THOSE STRIPES DO THIS CHILDREN WEAR TO THIS DAY !
When he come to the cave , Fear , the Hairless One , put out his hand and call him ` The Striped One that come by night , ' and the First of the Tigers be afraid of the Hairless One , and run back to the swamp howl . ''
Mowgli chuckle quietly here , his chin in the water .
`` So loud do he howl that Tha hear him and say , ` What be the sorrow ? '
And the First of the Tigers , lift up his muzzle to the new-made sky , which be now so old , say : ` Give me back my power , O Tha .
I be make ashamed before all the Jungle , and I have run away from a Hairless One , and he have call me a shameful name . '
` And why ? '
say Tha .
` Because I be smear with the mud of the marsh , ' say the First of the Tigers .
` Swim , then , and roll on the wet grass , and if it be mud it will wash away , ' say Tha ; and the First of the Tigers swam , and roll and roll upon the grass , till the Jungle run round and round before his eye , but not one little bar upon all his hide be change , and Tha , watch him , laugh .
Then the First of the Tigers say : ` What have I do that this come to me ? '
Tha say , ` Thou hast kill the buck , and thou hast let Death loose in the Jungle , and with Death have come Fear , so that the people of the Jungle be afraid one of the other , a thou art afraid of the Hairless One . '
The First of the Tigers say , ` They will never fear me , for I know them since the beginning . '
Tha say , ` Go and see . '
And the First of the Tigers run to and fro , call aloud to the deer and the pig and the sambhur and the porcupine and all the Jungle Peoples , and they all run away from him who have be their judge , because they be afraid .
`` Then the First of the Tigers come back , and his pride be break in him , and , beat his head upon the ground , he tear up the earth with all his foot and say : ` Remember that I be once the Master of the Jungle .
Do not forget me , O Tha !
Let my child remember that I be once without shame or fear ! '
And Tha say : ` This much I will do , because thou and I together saw the Jungle make .
For one night in each year it shall be a it be before the buck be kill -- for thee and for thy child .
In that one night , if ye meet the Hairless One -- and his name be Man -- ye shall not be afraid of him , but he shall be afraid of you , a though ye be judge of the Jungle and master of all thing .
Show him mercy in that night of his fear , for thou hast know what Fear be . '
`` Then the First of the Tigers answer , ' I be content ' ; but when next he drink he saw the black stripe upon his flank and his side , and he remember the name that the Hairless One have give him , and he be angry .
For a year he live in the marsh wait till Tha should keep his promise .
And upon a night when the jackal of the Moon -LSB- the Evening Star -RSB- stand clear of the Jungle , he felt that his Night be upon him , and he go to that cave to meet the Hairless One .
Then it happen a Tha promise , for the Hairless One fell down before him and lay along the ground , and the First of the Tigers strike him and break his back , for he think that there be but one such Thing in the Jungle , and that he have kill Fear .
Then , nose above the kill , he hear Tha come down from the wood of the North , and presently the voice of the First of the Elephants , which be the voice that we hear now -- '' The thunder be roll up and down the dry , scarred hill , but it bring no rain -- only heat -- lightning that flicker along the ridge -- and Hathi go on : `` THAT be the voice he hear , and it say : ` Is this thy mercy ? '
The First of the Tigers lick his lip and say : ` What matter ?
I have kill Fear . '
And Tha say : ' O blind and foolish !
Thou hast untie the foot of Death , and he will follow thy trail till thou diest .
Thou hast taught Man to kill ! '
`` The First of the Tigers , stand stiffly to his kill , say .
` He be a the buck be .
There be no Fear .
Now I will judge the Jungle Peoples once more . '
`` And Tha say : ` Never again shall the Jungle Peoples come to thee .
They shall never cross thy trail , nor sleep near thee , nor follow after thee , nor browse by thy lair .
Only Fear shall follow thee , and with a blow that thou canst not see he shall bid thee wait his pleasure .
He shall make the ground to open under thy foot , and the creeper to twist about thy neck , and the tree-trunks to grow together about thee high than thou canst leap , and at the last he shall take thy hide to wrap his cub when they be cold .
Thou hast show him no mercy , and none will he show thee . '
`` The First of the Tigers be very bold , for his Night be still on him , and he say : ` The Promise of Tha be the Promise of Tha .
He will not take away my Night ? '
And Tha say : ` The one Night be thine , a I have say , but there be a price to pay .
Thou hast taught Man to kill , and he be no slow learner . '
`` The First of the Tigers say : ` He be here under my foot , and his back be break .
Let the Jungle know I have kill Fear . '
`` Then Tha laugh , and say : ` Thou hast kill one of many , but thou thyself shalt tell the Jungle -- for thy Night be end . '
`` So the day come ; and from the mouth of the cave go out another Hairless One , and he saw the kill in the path , and the First of the Tigers above it , and he take a pointed stick -- '' `` They throw a thing that cut now , '' say Ikki , rustle down the bank ; for Ikki be consider uncommonly good eating by the Gonds -- they call him Ho-Igoo -- and he know something of the wicked little Gondee axe that whirl across a clearing like a dragon-fly .
`` It be a pointed stick , such a they put in the foot of a pit-trap , '' say Hathi , `` and throw it , he strike the First of the Tigers deep in the flank .
Thus it happen a Tha say , for the First of the Tigers run howl up and down the Jungle till he tear out the stick , and all the Jungle know that the Hairless One could strike from far off , and they fear more than before .
So it come about that the First of the Tigers teach the Hairless One to kill -- and ye know what harm that have since do to all our people -- through the noose , and the pitfall , and the hidden trap , and the fly stick and the sting fly that come out of white smoke -LSB- Hathi mean the rifle -RSB- , and the Red Flower that drive u into the open .
Yet for one night in the year the Hairless One fear the Tiger , a Tha promise , and never have the Tiger give him cause to be less afraid .
Where he find him , there he kill him , remember how the First of the Tigers be make ashamed .
For the rest , Fear walk up and down the Jungle by day and by night . ''
`` Ahi !
Aoo ! ''
say the deer , thinking of what it all mean to them .
`` And only when there be one great Fear over all , a there be now , can we of the Jungle lay aside our little fear , and meet together in one place a we do now . ''
`` For one night only do Man fear the Tiger ? ''
say Mowgli .
`` For one night only , '' say Hathi .
`` But I -- but we -- but all the Jungle know that Shere Khan kill Man twice and thrice in a moon . ''
`` Even so .
THEN he spring from behind and turn his head aside a he strike , for he be full of fear .
If Man look at him he would run .
But on his one Night he go openly down to the village .
He walk between the house and thrust his head into the doorway , and the men fall on their face , and there he do his kill .
One kill in that Night . ''
`` Oh ! ''
say Mowgli to himself , roll over in the water .
`` NOW I see why it be Shere Khan bid me look at him !
He get no good of it , for he could not hold his eye steady , and -- and I certainly do not fall down at his foot .
But then I be not a man , be of the Free People . ''
`` Umm ! ''
say Bagheera deep in his furry throat .
`` Does the Tiger know his Night ? ''
`` Never till the Jackal of the Moon stand clear of the evening mist .
Sometimes it fall in the dry summer and sometimes in the wet rain -- this one Night of the Tiger .
But for the First of the Tigers , this would never have be , nor would any of u have know fear . ''
The deer grunt sorrowfully and Bagheera 's lip curl in a wicked smile .
`` Do men know this -- tale ? ''
say he .
`` None know it except the tiger , and we , the elephant -- the child of Tha .
Now ye by the pool have hear it , and I have speak . ''
Hathi dip his trunk into the water a a sign that he do not wish to talk .
`` But -- but -- but , '' say Mowgli , turn to Baloo , `` why do not the First of the Tigers continue to eat grass and leaf and tree ?
He do but break the buck 's neck .
He do not EAT .
What lead him to the hot meat ? ''
`` The tree and the creeper mark him , Little Brother , and make him the striped thing that we see .
Never again would he eat their fruit ; but from that day he revenge himself upon the deer , and the others , the Eaters of Grass , '' say Baloo .
`` Then THOU knowest the tale .
Heh ?
Why have I never hear ? ''
`` Because the Jungle be full of such tale .
If I make a beginning there would never be an end to them .
Let go my ear , Little Brother . ''
THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE Just to give you an idea of the immense variety of the Jungle Law , I have translate into verse -LRB- Baloo always recite them in a sort of sing-song -RRB- a few of the law that apply to the wolf .
There be , of course , hundred and hundred more , but these will do for specimen of the simpler ruling .
Now this be the Law of the Jungle -- a old and as true a the sky ; And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper , but the Wolf that shall break it must die .
As the creeper that girdle the tree-trunk the Law runneth forward and back -- For the strength of the Pack be the Wolf , and the strength of the Wolf be the Pack .
Wash daily from nose-tip to tail-tip ; drink deeply , but never too deep ; And remember the night be for hunt , and forget not the day be for sleep .
The jackal may follow the Tiger , but , Cub , when thy whisker be grow , Remember the Wolf be a hunter -- go forth and get food of thine own .
Keep peace with the Lords of the Jungle -- the Tiger , the Panther , the Bear ; And trouble not Hathi the Silent , and mock not the Boar in his lair .
When Pack meet with Pack in the Jungle , and neither will go from the trail , Lie down till the leader have speak -- it may be fair word shall prevail .
When ye fight with a Wolf of the Pack , ye must fight him alone and afar , Lest others take part in the quarrel , and the Pack be diminish by war .
The Lair of the Wolf be his refuge , and where he have make him his home , Not even the Head Wolf may enter , not even the Council may come .
The Lair of the Wolf be his refuge , but where he have digged it too plain , The Council shall send him a message , and so he shall change it again .
If ye kill before midnight , be silent , and wake not the wood with your bay , Lest ye frighten the deer from the crop , and the brother go empty away .
Ye may kill for yourselves , and your mate , and your cub a they need , and ye can ; But kill not for pleasure of killing , and SEVEN TIMES NEVER KILL MAN .
If ye plunder his Kill from a weak , devour not all in thy pride ; Pack-Right be the right of the mean ; so leave him the head and the hide .
The Kill of the Pack be the meat of the Pack .
Ye must eat where it lie ; And no one may carry away of that meat to his lair , or he die .
The Kill of the Wolf be the meat of the Wolf .
He may do what he will , But , till he have give permission , the Pack may not eat of that Kill .
Cub-Right be the right of the Yearling .
From all of his Pack he may claim Full-gorge when the killer have eat ; and none may refuse him the same .
Lair-Right be the right of the Mother .
From all of her year she may claim One haunch of each kill for her litter , and none may deny her the same .
Cave-Right be the right of the Father -- to hunt by himself for his own .
He be free of all call to the Pack ; he be judge by the Council alone .
Because of his age and his cunning , because of his gripe and his paw , In all that the Law leaveth open , the word of the Head Wolf be Law .
Now these be the Laws of the Jungle , and many and mighty be they ; But the head and the hoof of the Law and the haunch and the hump be -- Obey !
THE MIRACLE OF PURUN BHAGAT The night we felt the earth would move We stole and pluck him by the hand , Because we love him with the love That know but can not understand .
And when the roaring hillside break , And all our world fell down in rain , We save him , we the Little Folk ; But lo !
he do not come again !
Mourn now , we save him for the sake Of such poor love a wild one may .
Mourn ye !
Our brother will not wake , And his own kind drive u away !
Dirge of the Langurs .
There be once a man in India who be Prime Minister of one of the semi-independent native States in the north-western part of the country .
He be a Brahmin , so high-caste that caste cease to have any particular meaning for him ; and his father have be an important official in the gay-coloured tag-rag and bobtail of an old-fashioned Hindu Court .
But a Purun Dass grow up he felt that the old order of thing be change , and that if any one wish to get on in the world he must stand well with the English , and imitate all that the English believe to be good .
At the same time a native official must keep his own master 's favour .
This be a difficult game , but the quiet , close-mouthed young Brahmin , help by a good English education at a Bombay University , play it coolly , and rise , step by step , to be Prime Minister of the kingdom .
That be to say , he hold more real power than his master the Maharajah .
When the old king -- who be suspicious of the English , their railway and telegraph -- die , Purun Dass stand high with his young successor , who have be tutor by an Englishman ; and between them , though he always take care that his master should have the credit , they establish school for little girl , make road , and start State dispensary and show of agricultural implement , and publish a yearly blue-book on the `` Moral and Material Progress of the State , '' and the Foreign Office and the Government of India be delight .
Very few native States take up English progress altogether , for they will not believe , a Purun Dass show he do , that what be good for the Englishman must be twice as good for the Asiatic .
The Prime Minister become the honoured friend of Viceroys , and Governors , and Lieutenant-Governors , and medical missionary , and common missionary , and hard-riding English officer who come to shoot in the State preserve , as well a of whole host of tourist who travel up and down India in the cold weather , show how thing ought to be manage .
In his spare time he would endow scholarship for the study of medicine and manufacture on strictly English line , and write letter to the `` Pioneer '' , the great Indian daily paper , explain his master 's aim and object .
At last he go to England on a visit , and have to pay enormous sum to the priest when he come back ; for even so high-caste a Brahmin a Purun Dass lose caste by cross the black sea .
In London he meet and talk with every one worth know -- men whose name go all over the world -- and saw a great deal more than he say .
He be give honorary degree by learned university , and he make speech and talk of Hindu social reform to English lady in even dress , till all London cry , `` This be the most fascinating man we have ever meet at dinner since cloth be first laid . ''
When he return to India there be a blaze of glory , for the Viceroy himself make a special visit to confer upon the Maharajah the Grand Cross of the Star of India -- all diamond and ribbon and enamel ; and at the same ceremony , while the cannon boom , Purun Dass be make a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire ; so that his name stand Sir Purun Dass , K.C.I.E . .
That evening , at dinner in the big Viceregal tent , he stand up with the badge and the collar of the Order on his breast , and reply to the toast of his master 's health , make a speech few Englishmen could have better .
Next month , when the city have return to it sun-baked quiet , he do a thing no Englishman would have dream of do ; for , so far a the world 's affair go , he die .
The jewelled order of his knighthood go back to the Indian Government , and a new Prime Minister be appoint to the charge of affair , and a great game of General Post begin in all the subordinate appointment .
The priest know what have happen , and the people guess ; but India be the one place in the world where a man can do a he please and nobody ask why ; and the fact that Dewan Sir Purun Dass , K.C.I.E . , have resign position , palace , and power , and take up the begging-bowl and ochre-coloured dress of a Sunnyasi , or holy man , be consider nothing extraordinary .
He have be , a the Old Law recommend , twenty year a youth , twenty year a fighter , -- though he have never carry a weapon in his life , -- and twenty year head of a household .
He have use his wealth and his power for what he know both to be worth ; he have take honour when it come his way ; he have see men and city far and near , and men and city have stand up and honour him .
Now he would let those thing go , a a man drop the cloak he no longer need .
Behind him , a he walk through the city gate , an antelope skin and brass-handled crutch under his arm , and a begging-bowl of polished brown coco-de-mer in his hand , barefoot , alone , with eye cast on the ground -- behind him they be fire salute from the bastion in honour of his happy successor .
Purun Dass nod .
All that life be end ; and he bore it no more ill-will or good-will than a man bear to a colourless dream of the night .
He be a Sunnyasi -- a houseless , wander mendicant , depend on his neighbour for his daily bread ; and so long a there be a morsel to divide in India , neither priest nor beggar starves .
He have never in his life taste meat , and very seldom eat even fish .
A five-pound note would have cover his personal expense for food through any one of the many year in which he have be absolute master of million of money .
Even when he be be lionise in London he have hold before him his dream of peace and quiet -- the long , white , dusty Indian road , print all over with bare foot , the incessant , slow-moving traffic , and the sharp-smelling wood smoke curl up under the fig-trees in the twilight , where the wayfarer sit at their evening meal .
When the time come to make that dream true the Prime Minister take the proper step , and in three day you might more easily have find a bubble in the trough of the long Atlantic sea , than Purun Dass among the roving , gathering , separate million of India .
At night his antelope skin be spread where the darkness overtake him -- sometimes in a Sunnyasi monastery by the roadside ; sometimes by a mud-pillar shrine of Kala Pir , where the Jogis , who be another misty division of holy men , would receive him a they do those who know what cast and division be worth ; sometimes on the outskirt of a little Hindu village , where the child would steal up with the food their parent have prepare ; and sometimes on the pitch of the bare grazing-grounds , where the flame of his stick fire wake the drowsy camel .
It be all one to Purun Dass -- or Purun Bhagat , a he call himself now .
Earth , people , and food be all one .
But unconsciously his foot draw him away northward and eastward ; from the south to Rohtak ; from Rohtak to Kurnool ; from Kurnool to ruin Samanah , and then up-stream along the dried bed of the Gugger river that fill only when the rain fall in the hill , till one day he saw the far line of the great Himalayas .
Then Purun Bhagat smile , for he remember that his mother be of Rajput Brahmin birth , from Kulu way -- a Hill-woman , always home-sick for the snow -- and that the least touch of Hill blood draw a man in the end back to where he belong .
`` Yonder , '' say Purun Bhagat , breast the low slope of the Sewaliks , where the cactus stand up like seven-branched candlestick - `` yonder I shall sit down and get knowledge '' ; and the cool wind of the Himalayas whistle about his ear a he tread the road that lead to Simla .
The last time he have come that way it have be in state , with a clatter cavalry escort , to visit the gentle and most affable of Viceroys ; and the two have talk for an hour together about mutual friend in London , and what the Indian common folk really think of thing .
This time Purun Bhagat pay no call , but lean on the rail of the Mall , watch that glorious view of the Plains spread out forty mile below , till a native Mohammedan policeman tell him he be obstruct traffic ; and Purun Bhagat salaam reverently to the Law , because he know the value of it , and be seek for a Law of his own .
Then he move on , and sleep that night in an empty hut at Chota Simla , which look like the very last end of the earth , but it be only the beginning of his journey .
He follow the Himalaya-Thibet road , the little ten-foot track that be blast out of solid rock , or strut out on timber over gulfs a thousand foot deep ; that dip into warm , wet , shut-in valley , and climb out across bare , grassy hill-shoulders where the sun strike like a burning-glass ; or turn through dripping , dark forest where the tree-ferns dress the trunk from head to heel , and the pheasant call to his mate .
And he meet Thibetan herdsman with their dog and flock of sheep , each sheep with a little bag of borax on his back , and wander wood-cutters , and cloak and blanket Lamas from Thibet , come into India on pilgrimage , and envoy of little solitary Hill-states , post furiously on ring-streaked and piebald pony , or the cavalcade of a Rajah pay a visit ; or else for a long , clear day he would see nothing more than a black bear grunting and root below in the valley .
When he first start , the roar of the world he have leave still ring in his ear , a the roar of a tunnel ring long after the train have pass through ; but when he have put the Mutteeanee Pass behind him that be all do , and Purun Bhagat be alone with himself , walk , wonder , and thinking , his eye on the ground , and his thought with the cloud .
One evening he cross the high pas he have meet till then -- it have be a two-day 's climb -- and come out on a line of snow-peaks that band all the horizon -- mountain from fifteen to twenty thousand foot high , look almost near enough to hit with a stone , though they be fifty or sixty mile away .
The pas be crown with dense , dark forest -- deodar , walnut , wild cherry , wild olive , and wild pear , but mostly deodar , which be the Himalayan cedar ; and under the shadow of the deodar stand a deserted shrine to Kali -- who be Durga , who be Sitala , who be sometimes worship against the smallpox .
Purun Dass sweep the stone floor clean , smile at the grin statue , make himself a little mud fireplace at the back of the shrine , spread his antelope skin on a bed of fresh pine-needles , tuck his bairagi -- his brass-handled crutch -- under his armpit , and sit down to rest .
Immediately below him the hillside fell away , clean and clear for fifteen hundred foot , where a little village of stone-walled house , with roof of beaten earth , clung to the steep tilt .
All round it the tiny terraced field lay out like apron of patchwork on the knee of the mountain , and cow no big than beetle graze between the smooth stone circle of the threshing-floors .
Looking across the valley , the eye be deceive by the size of thing , and could not at first realise that what seem to be low scrub , on the opposite mountain-flank , be in truth a forest of hundred-foot pine .
Purun Bhagat saw an eagle swoop across the gigantic hollow , but the great bird dwindle to a dot ere it be half-way over .
A few band of scattered cloud string up and down the valley , catch on a shoulder of the hill , or rise up and die out when they be level with the head of the pas .
And `` Here shall I find peace , '' say Purun Bhagat .
Now , a Hill-man make nothing of a few hundred foot up or down , and as soon a the villager saw the smoke in the deserted shrine , the village priest climb up the terraced hillside to welcome the stranger .
When he meet Purun Bhagat 's eye -- the eye of a man use to control thousand -- he bow to the earth , take the begging-bowl without a word , and return to the village , say , `` We have at last a holy man .
Never have I see such a man .
He be of the Plains -- but pale-coloured -- a Brahmin of the Brahmins . ''
Then all the housewife of the village say , `` Think you he will stay with u ? ''
and each do her best to cook the most savoury meal for the Bhagat .
Hill-food be very simple , but with buckwheat and Indian corn , and rice and red pepper , and little fish out of the stream in the valley , and honey from the flue-like hive build in the stone wall , and dry apricot , and turmeric , and wild ginger , and bannock of flour , a devout woman can make good thing , and it be a full bowl that the priest carry to the Bhagat .
Was he go to stay ?
ask the priest .
Would he need a chela -- a disciple -- to beg for him ?
Had he a blanket against the cold weather ?
Was the food good ?
Purun Bhagat ate , and thank the giver .
It be in his mind to stay .
That be sufficient , say the priest .
Let the begging-bowl be place outside the shrine , in the hollow make by those two twisted root , and daily should the Bhagat be feed ; for the village felt honour that such a man -- he look timidly into the Bhagat 's face -- should tarry among them .
That day saw the end of Purun Bhagat 's wandering .
He have come to the place appoint for him -- the silence and the space .
After this , time stop , and he , sit at the mouth of the shrine , could not tell whether he be alive or dead ; a man with control of his limb , or a part of the hill , and the cloud , and the shifting rain and sunlight .
He would repeat a Name softly to himself a hundred hundred time , till , at each repetition , he seem to move more and more out of his body , sweep up to the door of some tremendous discovery ; but , just a the door be open , his body would drag him back , and , with grief , he felt he be lock up again in the flesh and bone of Purun Bhagat .
Every morning the fill begging-bowl be lay silently in the crutch of the root outside the shrine .
Sometimes the priest brought it ; sometimes a Ladakhi trader , lodge in the village , and anxious to get merit , trudge up the path ; but , more often , it be the woman who have cook the meal overnight ; and she would murmur , hardly above her breath .
`` Speak for me before the god , Bhagat .
Speak for such a one , the wife of so-and-so ! ''
Now and then some bold child would be allow the honour , and Purun Bhagat would hear him drop the bowl and run as fast a his little leg could carry him , but the Bhagat never come down to the village .
It be lay out like a map at his foot .
He could see the evening gathering , hold on the circle of the threshing-floors , because that be the only level ground ; could see the wonderful unnamed green of the young rice , the indigo blue of the Indian corn , the dock-like patch of buckwheat , and , in it season , the red bloom of the amaranth , whose tiny seed , be neither grain nor pulse , make a food that can be lawfully eat by Hindus in time of fast .
When the year turn , the roof of the hut be all little square of pure gold , for it be on the roof that they lay out their cob of the corn to dry .
Hiving and harvest , rice-sowing and husking , pass before his eye , all embroider down there on the many-sided plot of field , and he think of them all , and wonder what they all lead to at the long last .
Even in populate India a man can not a day sit still before the wild thing run over him a though he be a rock ; and in that wilderness very soon the wild thing , who know Kali 's Shrine well , come back to look at the intruder .
The langur , the big gray-whiskered monkey of the Himalayas , be , naturally , the first , for they be alive with curiosity ; and when they have upset the begging-bowl , and roll it round the floor , and try their teeth on the brass-handled crutch , and make face at the antelope skin , they decide that the human be who sit so still be harmless .
At even , they would leap down from the pine , and beg with their hand for thing to eat , and then swing off in graceful curve .
They like the warmth of the fire , too , and huddle round it till Purun Bhagat have to push them aside to throw on more fuel ; and in the morning , as often a not , he would find a furry ape share his blanket .
All day long , one or other of the tribe would sit by his side , star out at the snow , croon and look unspeakably wise and sorrowful .
After the monkey come the barasingh , that big deer which be like our red deer , but strong .
He wish to rub off the velvet of his horn against the cold stone of Kali 's statue , and stamp his foot when he saw the man at the shrine .
But Purun Bhagat never move , and , little by little , the royal stag edge up and nuzzle his shoulder .
Purun Bhagat slide one cool hand along the hot antler , and the touch soothe the fret beast , who bow his head , and Purun Bhagat very softly rub and ravel off the velvet .
Afterward , the barasingh bring his doe and fawn -- gentle thing that mumble on the holy man 's blanket -- or would come alone at night , his eye green in the fire-flicker , to take his share of fresh walnut .
At last , the musk-deer , the shyest and almost the small of the deerlets , come , too , her big rabbity ear erect ; even brindled , silent mushick-nabha must need find out what the light in the shrine meant , and drop out her moose-like nose into Purun Bhagat 's lap , come and go with the shadow of the fire .
Purun Bhagat call them all `` my brother , '' and his low call of `` Bhai !
Bhai ! ''
would draw them from the forest at noon if they be within ear shot .
The Himalayan black bear , moody and suspicious -- Sona , who have the V-shaped white mark under his chin -- pass that way more than once ; and since the Bhagat show no fear , Sona show no anger , but watch him , and come close , and beg a share of the caress , and a dole of bread or wild berry .
Often , in the still dawn , when the Bhagat would climb to the very crest of the pas to watch the red day walk along the peak of the snow , he would find Sona shuffle and grunt at his heel , thrust , a curious fore-paw under fall trunk , and bring it away with a WHOOF of impatience ; or his early step would wake Sona where he lay curl up , and the great brute , rise erect , would think to fight , till he hear the Bhagat 's voice and know his best friend .
Nearly all hermit and holy men who live apart from the big city have the reputation of be able to work miracle with the wild thing , but all the miracle lie in keep still , in never make a hasty movement , and , for a long time , at least , in never look directly at a visitor .
The villager saw the outline of the barasingh stalk like a shadow through the dark forest behind the shrine ; saw the minaul , the Himalayan pheasant , blaze in her best colour before Kali 's statue ; and the langur on their haunch , inside , play with the walnut shell .
Some of the child , too , have hear Sona sing to himself , bear-fashion , behind the fallen rock , and the Bhagat 's reputation a miracle-worker stand firm .
Yet nothing be far from his mind than miracle .
He believe that all thing be one big Miracle , and when a man know that much he know something to go upon .
He know for a certainty that there be nothing great and nothing little in this world : and day and night he strive to think out his way into the heart of thing , back to the place whence his soul have come .
So thinking , his untrimmed hair fell down about his shoulder , the stone slab at the side of the antelope skin be dent into a little hole by the foot of his brass-handled crutch , and the place between the tree-trunks , where the begging-bowl rest day after day , sunk and wore into a hollow almost as smooth a the brown shell itself ; and each beast know his exact place at the fire .
The field change their colour with the season ; the threshing-floors fill and empty , and fill again and again ; and again and again , when winter come , the langur frisk among the branch feather with light snow , till the mother-monkeys bring their sad-eyed little baby up from the warmer valley with the spring .
There be few change in the village .
The priest be old , and many of the little child who use to come with the begging-dish send their own child now ; and when you ask of the villager how long their holy man have live in Kali 's Shrine at the head of the pas , they answer , `` Always . ''
Then come such summer rain a have not be know in the Hills for many season .
Through three good month the valley be wrap in cloud and soaking mist -- steady , unrelenting downfall , break off into thunder-shower after thunder-shower .
Kali 's Shrine stand above the cloud , for the most part , and there be a whole month in which the Bhagat never catch a glimpse of his village .
It be pack away under a white floor of cloud that sway and shift and roll on itself and bulge upward , but never break from it pier -- the streaming flank of the valley .
All that time he hear nothing but the sound of a million little water , overhead from the tree , and underfoot along the ground , soak through the pine-needles , drip from the tongue of draggled fern , and spout in newly-torn muddy channel down the slope .
Then the sun come out , and draw forth the good incense of the deodar and the rhododendron , and that far-off , clean smell which the Hill people call `` the smell of the snow . ''
The hot sunshine last for a week , and then the rain gather together for their last downpour , and the water fell in sheet that flay off the skin of the ground and leap back in mud .
Purun Bhagat heap his fire high that night , for he be sure his brother would need warmth ; but never a beast come to the shrine , though he call and call till he drop asleep , wonder what have happen in the wood .
It be in the black heart of the night , the rain drum like a thousand drum , that he be rouse by a plucking at his blanket , and , stretch out , felt the little hand of a langur .
`` It be well here than in the tree , '' he say sleepily , loosen a fold of blanket ; `` take it and be warm . ''
The monkey catch his hand and pull hard .
`` Is it food , then ? ''
say Purun Bhagat .
`` Wait awhile , and I will prepare some . ''
As he kneel to throw fuel on the fire the langur run to the door of the shrine , croon and run back again , pluck at the man 's knee .
`` What be it ?
What be thy trouble , Brother ? ''
say Purun Bhagat , for the langur 's eye be full of thing that he could not tell .
`` Unless one of thy caste be in a trap -- and none set trap here -- I will not go into that weather .
Look , Brother , even the barasingh come for shelter ! ''
The deer 's antler clash a he stride into the shrine , clash against the grin statue of Kali .
He lower them in Purun Bhagat 's direction and stamp uneasily , hiss through his half-shut nostril .
`` Hai !
Hai !
Hai ! ''
say the Bhagat , snap his finger , `` Is THIS payment for a night 's lodging ? ''
But the deer push him toward the door , and a he do so Purun Bhagat hear the sound of something open with a sigh , and saw two slab of the floor draw away from each other , while the sticky earth below smack it lip .
`` Now I see , '' say Purun Bhagat .
`` No blame to my brother that they do not sit by the fire to-night .
The mountain be fall .
And yet -- why should I go ? ''
His eye fell on the empty begging-bowl , and his face change .
`` They have give me good food daily since -- since I come , and , if I be not swift , to-morrow there will not be one mouth in the valley .
Indeed , I must go and warn them below .
Back there , Brother !
Let me get to the fire . ''
The barasingh back unwillingly a Purun Bhagat drive a pine torch deep into the flame , twirl it till it be well lit .
`` Ah !
ye come to warn me , '' he say , rise .
`` Better than that we shall do ; good than that .
Out , now , and lend me thy neck , Brother , for I have but two foot . ''
He clutch the bristle withers of the barasingh with his right hand , hold the torch away with his left , and step out of the shrine into the desperate night .
There be no breath of wind , but the rain nearly drown the flare a the great deer hurry down the slope , slide on his haunch .
As soon a they be clear of the forest more of the Bhagat 's brother join them .
He hear , though he could not see , the langur press about him , and behind them the uhh !
uhh !
of Sona .
The rain mat his long white hair into rope ; the water splash beneath his bare foot , and his yellow robe clung to his frail old body , but he step down steadily , lean against the barasingh .
He be no long a holy man , but Sir Purun Dass , K.C.I.E . , Prime Minister of no small State , a man accustom to command , go out to save life .
Down the steep , plashy path they pour all together , the Bhagat and his brother , down and down till the deer 's foot click and stumble on the wall of a threshing-floor , and he snort because he smelt Man .
Now they be at the head of the one crook village street , and the Bhagat beat with his crutch on the barred window of the blacksmith 's house , a his torch blaze up in the shelter of the eaves .
`` Up and out ! ''
cry Purun Bhagat ; and he do not know his own voice , for it be year since he have speak aloud to a man .
`` The hill fall !
The hill be fall !
Up and out , oh , you within ! ''
`` It be our Bhagat , '' say the blacksmith 's wife .
`` He stand among his beast .
Gather the little one and give the call . ''
It run from house to house , while the beast , cramp in the narrow way , surge and huddle round the Bhagat , and Sona puff impatiently .
The people hurry into the street -- they be no more than seventy soul all tell -- and in the glare of the torch they saw their Bhagat hold back the terrified barasingh , while the monkey pluck piteously at his skirt , and Sona sit on his haunch and roar .
`` Across the valley and up the next hill ! ''
shout Purun Bhagat .
`` Leave none behind !
We follow ! ''
Then the people run a only Hill folk can run , for they know that in a landslip you must climb for the high ground across the valley .
They flee , splash through the little river at the bottom , and pant up the terraced field on the far side , while the Bhagat and his brother follow .
Up and up the opposite mountain they climb , call to each other by name -- the roll-call of the village -- and at their heel toil the big barasingh , weight by the failing strength of Purun Bhagat .
At last the deer stop in the shadow of a deep pinewood , five hundred foot up the hillside .
His instinct , that have warn him of the come slide , tell him he would he safe here .
Purun Bhagat drop fainting by his side , for the chill of the rain and that fierce climb be kill him ; but first he call to the scattered torch ahead , `` Stay and count your number '' ; then , whisper to the deer a he saw the light gather in a cluster : `` Stay with me , Brother .
Stay -- till -- I -- go ! ''
There be a sigh in the air that grow to a mutter , and a mutter that grow to a roar , and a roar that pass all sense of hearing , and the hillside on which the villager stand be hit in the darkness , and rock to the blow .
Then a note a steady , deep , and true a the deep C of the organ drown everything for perhaps five minute , while the very root of the pine quiver to it .
It die away , and the sound of the rain fall on mile of hard ground and grass change to the muffle drum of water on soft earth .
That tell it own tale .
Never a villager -- not even the priest -- be bold enough to speak to the Bhagat who have save their life .
They crouch under the pine and wait till the day .
When it come they look across the valley and saw that what have be forest , and terrace field , and track-threaded grazing-ground be one raw , red , fan-shaped smear , with a few tree fling head-down on the scarp .
That red ran high up the hill of their refuge , dam back the little river , which have begin to spread into a brick-coloured lake .
Of the village , of the road to the shrine , of the shrine itself , and the forest behind , there be no trace .
For one mile in width and two thousand foot in sheer depth the mountain-side have come away bodily , plan clean from head to heel .
And the villager , one by one , creep through the wood to pray before their Bhagat .
They saw the barasingh standing over him , who flee when they come near , and they hear the langur wail in the branch , and Sona moan up the hill ; but their Bhagat be dead , sit cross-legged , his back against a tree , his crutch under his armpit , and his face turn to the north-east .
The priest say : `` Behold a miracle after a miracle , for in this very attitude must all Sunnyasis be bury !
Therefore where he now be we will build the temple to our holy man . ''
They build the temple before a year be end -- a little stone-and-earth shrine -- and they call the hill the Bhagat 's hill , and they worship there with light and flower and offering to this day .
But they do not know that the saint of their worship be the late Sir Purun Dass , K.C.I.E . , D.C.L . , Ph.D. , etc . , once Prime Minister of the progressive and enlightened State of Mohiniwala , and honorary or corresponding member of more learned and scientific society than will ever do any good in this world or the next .
A SONG OF KABIR Oh , light be the world that he weigh in his hand !
Oh , heavy the tale of his fief and his land !
He have go from the guddee and put on the shroud , And depart in guise of bairagi avow !
Now the white road to Delhi be mat for his foot , The sal and the kikar must guard him from heat ; His home be the camp , and the waste , and the crowd -- He be seek the Way a bairagi avow !
He have look upon Man , and his eyeball be clear -LRB- There be One ; there be One , and but One , saith Kabir -RRB- ; The Red Mist of Doing have thin to a cloud -- He have take the Path for bairagi avow !
To learn and discern of his brother the clod , Of his brother the brute , and his brother the God .
He have go from the council and put on the shroud -LRB- `` Can ye hear ? ''
saith Kabir -RRB- , a bairagi avowed !
LETTING IN THE JUNGLE Veil them , cover them , wall them round -- Blossom , and creeper , and weed -- Let u forget the sight and the sound , The smell and the touch of the breed !
Fat black ash by the altar-stone , Here be the white-foot rain , And the do bring forth in the field unsown , And none shall affright them again ; And the blind wall crumble , unknown , o'erthrown And none shall inhabit again !
You will remember that after Mowgli have pin Shere Khan 's hide to the Council Rock , he tell as many a be leave of the Seeonee Pack that henceforward he would hunt in the Jungle alone ; and the four child of Mother and Father Wolf say that they would hunt with him .
But it be not easy to change one 's life all in a minute -- particularly in the Jungle .
The first thing Mowgli do , when the disorderly Pack have slink off , be to go to the home-cave , and sleep for a day and a night .
Then he tell Mother Wolf and Father Wolf as much a they could understand of his adventure among men ; and when he make the morning sun flicker up and down the blade of his skinning-knife , -- the same he have skin Shere Khan with , -- they say he have learn something .
Then Akela and Gray Brother have to explain their share of the great buffalo-drive in the ravine , and Baloo toil up the hill to hear all about it , and Bagheera scratch himself all over with pure delight at the way in which Mowgli have manage his war .
It be long after sunrise , but no one dreamed of go to sleep , and from time to time , during the talk , Mother Wolf would throw up her head , and sniff a deep snuff of satisfaction a the wind bring her the smell of the tiger-skin on the Council Rock .
`` But for Akela and Gray Brother here , '' Mowgli say , at the end , `` I could have do nothing .
Oh , mother , mother !
if thou hadst see the black herd-bulls pour down the ravine , or hurry through the gate when the Man-Pack flung stone at me ! ''
`` I be glad I do not see that last , '' say Mother Wolf stiffly .
`` It be not MY custom to suffer my cub to be drive to and fro like jackal .
I would have take a price from the Man-Pack ; but I would have spar the woman who give thee the milk .
Yes , I would have spar her alone . ''
`` Peace , peace , Raksha ! ''
say Father Wolf , lazily .
`` Our Frog have come back again -- so wise that his own father must lick his foot ; and what be a cut , more or less , on the head ?
Leave Men alone . ''
Baloo and Bagheera both echoed : `` Leave Men alone . ''
Mowgli , his head on Mother Wolf 's side , smile contentedly , and say that , for his own part , he never wish to see , or hear , or smell Man again .
`` But what , '' say Akela , cock one ear -- `` but what if men do not leave thee alone , Little Brother ? ''
`` We be FIVE , '' say Gray Brother , look round at the company , and snap his jaw on the last word .
`` We also might attend to that hunting , '' say Bagheera , with a little switch-switch of his tail , look at Baloo .
`` But why think of men now , Akela ? ''
`` For this reason , '' the Lone Wolf answer : `` when that yellow chief 's hide be hang up on the rock , I go back along our trail to the village , step in my track , turn aside , and lie down , to make a mixed trail in case one should follow u .
But when I have foul the trail so that I myself hardly know it again , Mang , the Bat , come hawk between the tree , and hang up above me . ''
Said Mang , `` The village of the Man-Pack , where they cast out the Man-cub , hum like a hornet 's nest . ''
`` It be a big stone that I throw , '' chuckle Mowgli , who have often amuse himself by throw ripe paw-paws into a hornet 's nest , and race off to the near pool before the hornet catch him .
`` I ask of Mang what he have see .
He say that the Red Flower blossom at the gate of the village , and men sit about it carry gun .
Now I know , for I have good cause , '' -- Akela look down at the old dry scar on his flank and side , -- `` that men do not carry gun for pleasure .
Presently , Little Brother , a man with a gun follow our trail -- if , indeed , he be not already on it . ''
`` But why should he ?
Men have cast me out .
What more do they need ? ''
say Mowgli angrily .
`` Thou art a man , Little Brother , '' Akela return .
`` It be not for US , the Free Hunters , to tell thee what thy brother do , or why . ''
He have just time to snatch up his paw a the skinning-knife cut deep into the ground below .
Mowgli strike quick than an average human eye could follow but Akela be a wolf ; and even a dog , who be very far remove from the wild wolf , his ancestor , can be wake out of deep sleep by a cart-wheel touch his flank , and can spring away unharmed before that wheel come on .
`` Another time , '' Mowgli say quietly , return the knife to it sheath , `` speak of the Man-Pack and of Mowgli in TWO breath -- not one . ''
`` Phff !
That be a sharp tooth , '' say Akela , snuff at the blade 's cut in the earth , `` but live with the Man-Pack have spoil thine eye , Little Brother .
I could have kill a buck while thou wast striking . ''
Bagheera sprang to his foot , thrust up his head as far a he could , sniff , and stiffen through every curve in his body .
Gray Brother follow his example quickly , keep a little to his left to get the wind that be blow from the right , while Akela bound fifty yard up wind , and , half-crouching , stiffen too .
Mowgli look on enviously .
He could smell thing a very few human being could , but he have never reach the hair-trigger-like sensitiveness of a Jungle nose ; and his three month in the smoky village have set him back sadly .
However , he dampen his finger , rub it on his nose , and stand erect to catch the upper scent , which , though it be the faint , be the truest .
`` Man ! ''
Akela growl , drop on his haunch .
`` Buldeo ! ''
say Mowgli , sit down .
`` He follow our trail , and yonder be the sunlight on his gun .
Look ! ''
It be no more than a splash of sunlight , for a fraction of a second , on the brass clamp of the old Tower musket , but nothing in the Jungle wink with just that flash , except when the cloud race over the sky .
Then a piece of mica , or a little pool , or even a highly-polished leaf will flash like a heliograph .
But that day be cloudless and still .
`` I know men would follow , '' say Akela triumphantly .
`` Not for nothing have I lead the Pack . ''
The four cub say nothing , but run down hill on their belly , melt into the thorn and under-brush a a mole melt into a lawn .
`` Where go ye , and without word ? ''
Mowgli call .
`` H'sh !
We roll his skull here before mid-day ! ''
Gray Brother answer .
`` Back !
Back and wait !
Man do not eat Man ! ''
Mowgli shriek .
`` Who be a wolf but now ?
Who drive the knife at me for think he might be Man ? ''
say Akela , a the four wolf turn back sullenly and drop to heel .
`` Am I to give reason for all I choose to , do ? ''
say Mowgli furiously .
`` That be Man !
There speak Man ! ''
Bagheera mutter under his whisker .
`` Even so do men talk round the King 's cage at Oodeypore .
We of the Jungle know that Man be wise of all .
If we trust our ear we should know that of all thing he be most foolish . ''
Raising his voice , he add , `` The Man-cub be right in this .
Men hunt in pack .
To kill one , unless we know what the others will do , be bad hunting .
Come , let u see what this Man mean toward u . ''
`` We will not come , '' Gray Brother growl .
`` Hunt alone , Little Brother .
WE know our own mind .
The skull would have be ready to bring by now . ''
Mowgli have be look from one to the other of his friend , his chest heaving and his eye full of tear .
He stride forward to the wolf , and , drop on one knee , say : `` Do I not know my mind ?
Look at me ! ''
They look uneasily , and when their eye wander , he call them back again and again , till their hair stand up all over their body , and they tremble in every limb , while Mowgli star and star .
`` Now , '' say he , `` of u five , which be leader ? ''
`` Thou art leader , Little Brother , '' say Gray Brother , and he lick Mowgli 's foot .
`` Follow , then , '' say Mowgli , and the four follow at his heel with their tail between their leg .
`` This come of live with the Man-Pack , '' say Bagheera , slip down after them .
`` There be more in the Jungle now than Jungle Law , Baloo . ''
The old bear say nothing , but he think many thing .
Mowgli cut across noiselessly through the Jungle , at right angle to Buldeo 's path , till , part the undergrowth , he saw the old man , his musket on his shoulder , run up the trail of overnight at a dog-trot .
You will remember that Mowgli have leave the village with the heavy weight of Shere Khan 's raw hide on his shoulder , while Akela and Gray Brother trot behind , so that the triple trail be very clearly mark .
Presently Buldeo come to where Akela , a you know , have go back and mixed it all up .
Then he sit down , and cough and grunt , and make little cast round and about into the Jungle to pick it up again , and , all the time he could have throw a stone over those who be watch him .
No one can be so silent a a wolf when he do not care to be hear ; and Mowgli , though the wolf think he move very clumsily , could come and go like a shadow .
They ring the old man a a school of porpoise ring a steamer at full speed , and a they ring him they talk unconcernedly , for their speech begin below the low end of the scale that untrained human being can hear .
-LSB- The other end be bound by the high squeak of Mang , the Bat , which very many people can not catch at all .
From that note all the bird and bat and insect talk take on . -RSB-
`` This be well than any kill , '' say Gray Brother , a Buldeo stoop and peer and puffed .
`` He look like a lose pig in the Jungles by the river .
What do he say ? ''
Buldeo be mutter savagely .
Mowgli translate .
`` He say that pack of wolf must have dance round me .
He say that he never saw such a trail in his life .
He say he be tire . ''
`` He will be rest before he pick it up again , '' say Bagheera coolly , a he slip round a tree-trunk , in the game of blindman 's - buff that they be play .
`` NOW , what do the lean thing do ? ''
`` Eat or blow smoke out of his mouth .
Men always play with their mouth , '' say Mowgli ; and the silent trailer saw the old man fill and light and puff at a water-pipe , and they take good note of the smell of the tobacco , so a to be sure of Buldeo in the dark night , if necessary .
Then a little knot of charcoal-burners come down the path , and naturally halt to speak to Buldeo , whose fame a a hunter reach for at least twenty mile round .
They all sit down and smoked , and Bagheera and the others come up and watch while Buldeo begin to tell the story of Mowgli , the Devil-child , from one end to another , with addition and invention .
How he himself have really kill Shere Khan ; and how Mowgli have turn himself into a wolf , and fought with him all the afternoon , and change into a boy again and bewitch Buldeo 's rifle , so that the bullet turn the corner , when he point it at Mowgli , and kill one of Buldeo 's own buffalo ; and how the village , know him to be the brave hunter in Seeonee , have send him out to kill this Devil-child .
But meantime the village have get hold of Messua and her husband , who be undoubtedly the father and mother of this Devil-child , and have barricade them in their own hut , and presently would torture them to make them confess they be witch and wizard , and then they would be burn to death .
`` When ? ''
say the charcoal-burners , because they would very much like to be present at the ceremony .
Buldeo say that nothing would be do till he return , because the village wish him to kill the Jungle Boy first .
After that they would dispose of Messua and her husband , and divide their land and buffalo among the village .
Messua 's husband have some remarkably fine buffalo , too .
It be an excellent thing to destroy wizard , Buldeo think ; and people who entertain Wolf-children out of the Jungle be clearly the bad kind of witch .
But , say the charcoal-burners , what would happen if the English heard of it ?
The English , they have hear , be a perfectly mad people , who would not let honest farmer kill witch in peace .
Why , say Buldeo , the head-man of the village would report that Messua and her husband have die of snake-bite .
THAT be all arrange , and the only thing now be to kill the Wolf-child .
They do not happen to have see anything of such a creature ?
The charcoal-burners look round cautiously , and thank their star they have not ; but they have no doubt that so brave a man a Buldeo would find him if any one could .
The sun be get rather low , and they have an idea that they would push on to Buldeo 's village and see that wicked witch .
Buldeo say that , though it be his duty to kill the Devil-child , he could not think of let a party of unarmed men go through the Jungle , which might produce the Wolf-demon at any minute , without his escort .
He , therefore , would accompany them , and if the sorcerer 's child appear -- well , he would show them how the best hunter in Seeonee dealt with such thing .
The Brahmin , he say , have give him a charm against the creature that make everything perfectly safe .
`` What say he ?
What say he ?
What say he ? ''
the wolf repeat every few minute ; and Mowgli translate until he come to the witch part of the story , which be a little beyond him , and then he say that the man and woman who have be so kind to him be trap .
`` Does Man trap Man ? ''
say Bagheera .
`` So he say .
I can not understand the talk .
They be all mad together .
What have Messua and her man to do with me that they should be put in a trap ; and what be all this talk about the Red Flower ?
I must look to this .
Whatever they would do to Messua they will not do till Buldeo return .
And so -- '' Mowgli think hard , with his finger play round the haft of the skinning-knife , while Buldeo and the charcoal-burners go off very valiantly in single file .
`` I go hot-foot back to the Man-Pack , '' Mowgli say at last .
`` And those ? ''
say Gray Brother , look hungrily after the brown back of the charcoal-burners .
`` Sing them home , '' say Mowgli , with a grin ; `` I do not wish them to be at the village gate till it be dark .
Can ye hold them ? ''
Gray Brother bar his white teeth in contempt .
`` We can head them round and round in circle like tethered goat -- if I know Man . ''
`` That I do not need .
Sing to them a little , l they be lonely on the road , and , Gray Brother , the song need not be of the sweet .
Go with them , Bagheera , and help make that song .
When night be shut down , meet me by the village -- Gray Brother know the place . ''
`` It be no light hunt to work for a Man-cub .
When shall I sleep ? ''
say Bagheera , yawning , though his eye show that he be delight with the amusement .
`` Me to sing to naked men !
But let u try . ''
He lower his head so that the sound would travel , and cry a long , long , `` Good hunting '' -- a midnight call in the afternoon , which be quite awful enough to begin with .
Mowgli hear it rumble , and rise , and fall , and die off in a creepy sort of whine behind him , and laugh to himself a he run through the Jungle .
He could see the charcoal-burners huddle in a knot ; old Buldeo 's gun-barrel waving , like a banana-leaf , to every point of the compass at once .
Then Gray Brother give the Ya-la-hi !
Yalaha !
call for the buck-driving , when the Pack drive the nilghai , the big blue cow , before them , and it seem to come from the very end of the earth , nearer , and nearer , and nearer , till it end in a shriek snap off short .
The other three answer , till even Mowgli could have vow that the full Pack be in full cry , and then they all break into the magnificent Morning-song in the Jungle , with every turn , and flourish , and grace-note that a deep-mouthed wolf of the Pack know .
This be a rough rendering of the song , but you must imagine what it sound like when it break the afternoon hush of the Jungle : -- One moment past our body cast No shadow on the plain ; Now clear and black they stride our track , And we run home again .
In morning hush , each rock and bush Stands hard , and high , and raw : Then give the Call : `` Good rest to all That keep The Jungle Law ! ''
Now horn and pelt our people melt In covert to abide ; Now , crouch and still , to cave and hill Our Jungle Barons glide .
Now , stark and plain , Man 's ox strain , That draw the new-yoked plough ; Now , strip and dread , the dawn be red Above the lit talao .
Ho !
Get to lair !
The sun 's aflare Behind the breathe grass : And crack through the young bamboo The warning whisper pass .
By day make strange , the wood we range With blink eye we scan ; While down the sky the wild duck cry `` The Day -- the Day to Man ! ''
The dew be dry that drench our hide Or wash about our way ; And where we drink , the puddled bank Is crisp into clay .
The traitor Dark give up each mark Of stretched or hooded claw ; Then hear the Call : `` Good rest to all That keep the Jungle Law ! ''
But no translation can give the effect of it , or the yelping scorn the Four throw into every word of it , a they hear the tree crash when the men hastily climb up into the branch , and Buldeo begin repeat incantation and charm .
Then they lay down and sleep , for , like all who live by their own exertion , they be of a methodical cast of mind ; and no one can work well without sleep .
Meantime , Mowgli be put the mile behind him , nine to the hour , swing on , delight to find himself so fit after all his cramped month among men .
The one idea in his head be to get Messua and her husband out of the trap , whatever it be ; for he have a natural mistrust of trap .
Later on , he promise himself , he would pay his debt to the village at large .
It be at twilight when he saw the well-remembered grazing-grounds , and the dhak-tree where Gray Brother have wait for him on the morning that he kill Shere Khan .
Angry a he be at the whole breed and community of Man , something jump up in his throat and make him catch his breath when he look at the village roof .
He notice that every one have come in from the field unusually early , and that , instead of get to their evening cooking , they gather in a crowd under the village tree , and chatter , and shout .
`` Men must always be make trap for men , or they be not content , '' say Mowgli .
`` Last night it be Mowgli -- but that night seem many Rains ago .
To-night it be Messua and her man .
To-morrow , and for very many night after , it will be Mowgli 's turn again . ''
He creep along outside the wall till he come to Messua 's hut , and look through the window into the room .
There lay Messua , gag , and bound hand and foot , breathe hard , and groaning : her husband be tie to the gaily-painted bedstead .
The door of the hut that open into the street be shut fast , and three or four people be sit with their back to it .
Mowgli know the manner and custom of the villager very fairly .
He argue that so long a they could eat , and talk , and smoke , they would not do anything else ; but as soon a they have feed they would begin to be dangerous .
Buldeo would be come in before long , and if his escort have do it duty , Buldeo would have a very interesting tale to tell .
So he go in through the window , and , stoop over the man and the woman , cut their thong , pull out the gag , and look round the hut for some milk .
Messua be half wild with pain and fear -LRB- she have be beat and stone all the morning -RRB- , and Mowgli put his hand over her mouth just in time to stop a scream .
Her husband be only bewildered and angry , and sit pick dust and thing out of his torn beard .
`` I know -- I know he would come , '' Messua sob at last .
`` Now do I KNOW that he be my son ! ''
and she hug Mowgli to her heart .
Up to that time Mowgli have be perfectly steady , but now he begin to tremble all over , and that surprise him immensely .
`` Why be these thong ?
Why have they tie thee ? ''
he ask , after a pause .
`` To be put to the death for make a son of thee -- what else ? ''
say the man sullenly .
`` Look !
I bleed . ''
Messua say nothing , but it be at her wound that Mowgli look , and they hear him grit his teeth when he saw the blood .
`` Whose work be this ? ''
say he .
`` There be a price to pay . ''
`` The work of all the village .
I be too rich .
I have too many cattle .
THEREFORE she and I be witch , because we give thee shelter . ''
`` I do not understand .
Let Messua tell the tale . ''
`` I give thee milk , Nathoo ; dost thou remember ? ''
Messua say timidly .
`` Because thou wast my son , whom the tiger take , and because I love thee very dearly .
They say that I be thy mother , the mother of a devil , and therefore worthy of death . ''
`` And what be a devil ? ''
say Mowgli .
`` Death I have see . ''
The man look up gloomily , but Messua laugh .
`` See ! ''
she say to her husband , `` I know -- I say that he be no sorcerer .
He be my son -- my son ! ''
`` Son or sorcerer , what good will that do u ? ''
the man answer .
`` We be a dead already . ''
`` Yonder be the road to the Jungle '' -- Mowgli point through the window .
`` Your hand and foot be free .
Go now . ''
`` We do not know the Jungle , my son , as -- a thou knowest , '' Messua begin .
`` I do not think that I could walk far . ''
`` And the men and woman would be upon our back and drag u here again , '' say the husband .
`` H 'm ! ''
say Mowgli , and he tickle the palm of his hand with the tip of his skinning-knife ; `` I have no wish to do harm to any one of this village -- YET .
But I do not think they will stay thee .
In a little while they will have much else to think upon .
Ah ! ''
he lift his head and listen to shout and trample outside .
`` So they have let Buldeo come home at last ? ''
`` He be send out this morning to kill thee , '' Messua cry .
`` Didst thou meet him ? ''
`` Yes -- we -- I meet him .
He have a tale to tell and while he be tell it there be time to do much .
But first I will learn what they mean .
Think where ye would go , and tell me when I come back . ''
He bound through the window and run along again outside the wall of the village till he come within ear-shot of the crowd round the peepul-tree .
Buldeo be lie on the ground , cough and groaning , and every one be ask him question .
His hair have fall about his shoulder ; his hand and leg be skin from climb up tree , and he could hardly speak , but he felt the importance of his position keenly .
From time to time he say something about devil and sing devil , and magic enchantment , just to give the crowd a taste of what be come .
Then he call for water .
`` Bah ! ''
say Mowgli .
`` Chatter -- chatter !
Talk , talk !
Men be blood-brothers of the Bandar-log .
Now he must wash his mouth with water ; now he must blow smoke ; and when all that be do he have still his story to tell .
They be very wise people -- men .
They will leave no one to guard Messua till their ear be stuff with Buldeo 's tale .
And -- I grow as lazy a they ! ''
He shake himself and glide back to the hut .
Just a he be at the window he felt a touch on his foot .
`` Mother , '' say he , for he know that tongue well , `` what dost THOU here ? ''
`` I hear my child sing through the wood , and I follow the one I love best .
Little Frog , I have a desire to see that woman who give thee milk , '' say Mother Wolf , all wet with the dew .
`` They have bind and mean to kill her .
I have cut those tie , and she go with her man through the Jungle . ''
`` I also will follow .
I be old , but not yet toothless . ''
Mother Wolf rear herself up on end , and look through the window into the dark of the hut .
In a minute she drop noiselessly , and all she say be : `` I give thee thy first milk ; but Bagheera speak truth : Man go to Man at the last . ''
`` Maybe , '' say Mowgli , with a very unpleasant look on his face ; `` but to-night I be very far from that trail .
Wait here , but do not let her see . ''
`` THOU wast never afraid of ME , Little Frog , '' say Mother Wolf , back into the high grass , and blot herself out , a she know how .
`` And now , '' say Mowgli cheerfully , a he swing into the hut again , `` they be all sit round Buldeo , who be say that which do not happen .
When his talk be finish , they say they will assuredly come here with the Red -- with fire and burn you both .
And then ? ''
`` I have speak to my man , '' say Messua .
`` Khanhiwara be thirty mile from here , but at Khanhiwara we may find the English -- '' `` And what Pack be they ? ''
say Mowgli .
`` I do not know .
They be white , and it be say that they govern all the land , and do not suffer people to burn or beat each other without witness .
If we can get thither to-night , we live .
Otherwise we die . ''
`` Live , then .
No man pass the gate to-night .
But what do HE do ? ''
Messua 's husband be on his hand and knee dig up the earth in one corner of the hut .
`` It be his little money , '' say Messua .
`` We can take nothing else . ''
`` Ah , yes .
The stuff that pass from hand to hand and never grow warmer .
Do they need it outside this place also ? ''
say Mowgli .
The man star angrily .
`` He be a fool , and no devil , '' he mutter .
`` With the money I can buy a horse .
We be too bruise to walk far , and the village will follow u in an hour . ''
`` I say they will NOT follow till I choose ; but a horse be well think of , for Messua be tire . ''
Her husband stand up and knot the last of the rupee into his waist-cloth .
Mowgli help Messua through the window , and the cool night air revive her , but the Jungle in the starlight look very dark and terrible .
`` Ye know the trail to Khanhiwara ? ''
Mowgli whisper .
They nod .
`` Good .
Remember , now , not to be afraid .
And there be no need to go quickly .
Only -- only there may be some small singing in the Jungle behind you and before . ''
`` Think you we would have risk a night in the Jungle through anything less than the fear of burning ?
It be well to be kill by beast than by men , '' say Messua 's husband ; but Messua look at Mowgli and smile .
`` I say , '' Mowgli go on , just a though he be Baloo repeat an old Jungle Law for the hundredth time to a foolish cub -- `` I say that not a tooth in the Jungle be bar against you ; not a foot in the Jungle be lift against you .
Neither man nor beast shall stay you till you come within eye-shot of Khanhiwara .
There will be a watch about you . ''
He turn quickly to Messua , say , `` HE do not believe , but thou wilt believe ? ''
`` Ay , surely , my son .
Man , ghost , or wolf of the Jungle , I believe . ''
`` HE will be afraid when he hear my people sing .
Thou wilt know and understand .
Go now , and slowly , for there be no need of any haste .
The gate be shut . ''
Messua fling herself sob at Mowgli 's foot , but he lift her very quickly with a shiver .
Then she hang about his neck and call him every name of bless she could think of , but her husband look enviously across his field , and say : `` IF we reach Khanhiwara , and I get the ear of the English , I will bring such a lawsuit against the Brahmin and old Buldeo and the others a shall eat the village to the bone .
They shall pay me twice over for my crop untilled and my buffalo unfed .
I will have a great justice . ''
Mowgli laugh .
`` I do not know what justice be , but -- come next Rains .
and see what be leave . ''
They go off toward the Jungle , and Mother Wolf leap from her place of hiding .
`` Follow ! ''
say Mowgli ; `` and look to it that all the Jungle know these two be safe .
Give tongue a little .
I would call Bagheera . ''
The long , low howl rise and fell , and Mowgli saw Messua 's husband flinch and turn , half mind to run back to the hut .
`` Go on , '' Mowgli call cheerfully .
`` I say there might be sing .
That call will follow up to Khanhiwara .
It be Favour of the Jungle . ''
Messua urge her husband forward , and the darkness shut down on them and Mother Wolf a Bagheera rise up almost under Mowgli 's foot , tremble with delight of the night that drive the Jungle People wild .
`` I be ashamed of thy brother , '' he say , purr .
`` What ?
Did they not sing sweetly to Buldeo ? ''
say Mowgli .
`` Too well !
Too well !
They make even ME forget my pride , and , by the Broken Lock that free me , I go sing through the Jungle a though I be out woo in the spring !
Didst thou not hear u ? ''
`` I have other game afoot .
Ask Buldeo if he like the song .
But where be the Four ?
I do not wish one of the Man-Pack to leave the gate to-night . ''
`` What need of the Four , then ? ''
say Bagheera , shift from foot to foot , his eye ablaze , and purr louder than ever .
`` I can hold them , Little Brother .
Is it kill at last ?
The singing and the sight of the men climb up the tree have make me very ready .
Who be Man that we should care for him -- the naked brown digger , the hairless and toothless , the eater of earth ?
I have follow him all day -- at noon -- in the white sunlight .
I herd him a the wolf herd buck .
I be Bagheera !
Bagheera !
Bagheera !
As I dance with my shadow , so danced I with those men .
Look ! ''
The great panther leap a a kitten leap at a dead leaf whirl overhead , struck leave and right into the empty air , that sang under the stroke , land noiselessly , and leap again and again , while the half purr , half growl gather head a steam rumble in a boiler .
`` I be Bagheera -- in the jungle -- in the night , and my strength be in me .
Who shall stay my stroke ?
Man-cub , with one blow of my paw I could beat thy head flat a a dead frog in the summer ! ''
`` Strike , then ! ''
say Mowgli , in the dialect of the village , NOT the talk of the Jungle , and the human word bring Bagheera to a full stop , fling back on haunch that quiver under him , his head just at the level of Mowgli 's .
Once more Mowgli star , a he have star at the rebellious cub , full into the beryl-green eye till the red glare behind their green go out like the light of a lighthouse shut off twenty mile across the sea ; till the eye drop , and the big head with them -- drop low and low , and the red rasp of a tongue grate on Mowgli 's instep .
`` Brother -- Brother -- Brother ! ''
the boy whisper , stroke steadily and lightly from the neck along the heaving back .
`` Be still , be still !
It be the fault of the night , and no fault of thine . ''
`` It be the smell of the night , '' say Bagheera penitently .
`` This air cry aloud to me .
But how dost THOU know ? ''
Of course the air round an Indian village be full of all kind of smell , and to any creature who do nearly all his thinking through his nose , smell be as madden a music and drug be to human being .
Mowgli gentle the panther for a few minute longer , and he lay down like a cat before a fire , his paw tuck under his breast , and his eye half shut .
`` Thou art of the Jungle and NOT of the Jungle , '' he say at last .
`` And I be only a black panther .
But I love thee , Little Brother . ''
`` They be very long at their talk under the tree , '' Mowgli say , without notice the last sentence .
`` Buldeo must have tell many tale .
They should come soon to drag the woman and her man out of the trap and put them into the Red Flower .
They will find that trap sprung .
Ho !
ho ! ''
`` Nay , listen , '' say Bagheera .
`` The fever be out of my blood now .
Let them find ME there !
Few would leave their house after meet me .
It be not the first time I have be in a cage ; and I do not think they will tie ME with cord . ''
`` Be wise , then , '' say Mowgli , laughing ; for he be begin to feel as reckless a the panther , who have glide into the hut .
`` Pah ! ''
Bagheera grunt .
`` This place be rank with Man , but here be just such a bed a they give me to lie upon in the King 's cage at Oodeypore .
Now I lie down . ''
Mowgli hear the string of the cot crack under the great brute 's weight .
`` By the Broken Lock that free me , they will think they have catch big game !
Come and sit beside me , Little Brother ; we will give them ` good hunting ' together ! ''
`` No ; I have another thought in my stomach .
The Man-Pack shall not know what share I have in the sport .
Make thine own hunt .
I do not wish to see them . ''
`` Be it so , '' say Bagheera .
`` Ah , now they come ! ''
The conference under the peepul-tree have be grow noisy and noisy , at the far end of the village .
It break in wild yell , and a rush up the street of men and woman , wave club and bamboo and sickle and knife .
Buldeo and the Brahmin be at the head of it , but the mob be close at their heel , and they cry , `` The witch and the wizard !
Let u see if hot coin will make them confess !
Burn the hut over their head !
We will teach them to shelter wolf-devils !
Nay , beat them first !
Torches !
More torch !
Buldeo , heat the gun-barrels ! ''
Here be some little difficulty with the catch of the door .
It have be very firmly fasten , but the crowd tear it away bodily , and the light of the torch stream into the room where , stretch at full length on the bed , his paw cross and lightly hang down over one end , black a the Pit , and terrible a a demon , be Bagheera .
There be one half-minute of desperate silence , a the front rank of the crowd claw and tear their way back from the threshold , and in that minute Bagheera raise his head and yawn -- elaborately , carefully , and ostentatiously -- a he would yawn when he wish to insult an equal .
The fringed lip draw back and up ; the red tongue curl ; the low jaw drop and drop till you could see half-way down the hot gullet ; and the gigantic dog-teeth stood clear to the pit of the gum till they ring together , upper and under , with the snick of steel-faced ward shoot home round the edge of a safe .
Next instant the street be empty ; Bagheera have leap back through the window , and stand at Mowgli 's side , while a yelling , scream torrent scramble and tumble one over another in their panic haste to get to their own hut .
`` They will not stir till day come , '' say Bagheera quietly .
`` And now ? ''
The silence of the afternoon sleep seem to have overtake the village ; but , a they listen , they could hear the sound of heavy grain-boxes be drag over earthen floor and set down against door .
Bagheera be quite right ; the village would not stir till daylight .
Mowgli sit still , and think , and his face grow darker and darker .
`` What have I do ? ''
say Bagheera , at last come to his foot , fawning .
`` Nothing but great good .
Watch them now till the day .
I sleep . ''
Mowgli run off into the Jungle , and drop like a dead man across a rock , and slept and sleep the day round , and the night back again .
When he wake , Bagheera be at his side , and there be a newly-killed buck at his foot .
Bagheera watch curiously while Mowgli go to work with his skinning-knife , ate and drank , and turn over with his chin in his hand .
`` The man and the woman be come safe within eye-shot of Khanhiwara , '' Bagheera say .
`` Thy lair mother send the word back by Chil , the Kite .
They find a horse before midnight of the night they be free , and go very quickly .
Is not that well ? ''
`` That be well , '' say Mowgli .
`` And thy Man-Pack in the village do not stir till the sun be high this morning .
Then they eat their food and run back quickly to their house . ''
`` Did they , by chance , see thee ? ''
`` It may have be .
I be roll in the dust before the gate at dawn , and I may have make also some small song to myself .
Now , Little Brother , there be nothing more to do .
Come hunting with me and Baloo .
He have new hive that he wish to show , and we all desire thee back again a of old .
Take off that look which make even me afraid !
The man and woman will not be put into the Red Flower , and all go well in the Jungle .
Is it not true ?
Let u forget the Man-Pack . ''
`` They shall be forget in a little while .
Where do Hathi fee to-night ? ''
`` Where he choose .
Who can answer for the Silent One ?
But why ?
What be there Hathi can do which we can not ? ''
`` Bid him and his three son come here to me . ''
`` But , indeed , and truly , Little Brother , it be not -- it be not seemly to say ` Come , ' and ` Go , ' to Hathi .
Remember , he be the Master of the Jungle , and before the Man-Pack change the look on thy face , he teach thee the Master-words of the Jungle . ''
`` That be all one .
I have a Master-word for him now .
Bid him come to Mowgli , the Frog : and if he do not hear at first , bid him come because of the Sack of the Fields of Bhurtpore . ''
`` The Sack of the Fields of Bhurtpore , '' Bagheera repeat two or three time to make sure .
`` I go .
Hathi can but be angry at the bad , and I would give a moon 's hunting to hear a Master-word that compel the Silent One . ''
He go away , leave Mowgli stab furiously with his skinning-knife into the earth .
Mowgli have never see human blood in his life before till he have see , and -- what mean much more to him -- smell Messua 's blood on the thong that bind her .
And Messua have be kind to him , and , so far a he know anything about love , he love Messua as completely a he hat the rest of mankind .
But deeply a he loathe them , their talk , their cruelty , and their cowardice , not for anything the Jungle have to offer could he bring himself to take a human life , and have that terrible scent of blood back again in his nostril .
His plan be simple , but much more thorough ; and he laugh to himself when he think that it be one of old Buldeo 's tale tell under the peepul-tree in the evening that have put the idea into his head .
`` It WAS a Master-word , '' Bagheera whisper in his ear .
`` They be feed by the river , and they obey a though they be bullock .
Look where they come now ! ''
Hathi and his three son have arrive , in their usual way , without a sound .
The mud of the river be still fresh on their flank , and Hathi be thoughtfully chew the green stem of a young plantain-tree that he have gouge up with his tusk .
But every line in his vast body show to Bagheera , who could see thing when he come across them , that it be not the Master of the Jungle speaking to a Man-cub , but one who be afraid come before one who be not .
His three son roll side by side , behind their father .
Mowgli hardly lift his head a Hathi give him `` Good hunting . ''
He keep him swing and rocking , and shift from one foot to another , for a long time before he speak ; and when he open his mouth it be to Bagheera , not to the elephant .
`` I will tell a tale that be tell to me by the hunter ye hunt to-day , '' say Mowgli .
`` It concern an elephant , old and wise , who fell into a trap , and the sharpened stake in the pit scar him from a little above his heel to the crest of his shoulder , leave a white mark . ''
Mowgli throw out his hand , and a Hathi wheel the moonlight show a long white scar on his slaty side , a though he have be strike with a red-hot whip .
`` Men come to take him from the trap , '' Mowgli continue , `` but he break his rope , for he be strong , and go away till his wound be heal .
Then come he , angry , by night to the field of those hunter .
And I remember now that he have three son .
These thing happen many , many Rains ago , and very far away -- among the field of Bhurtpore .
What come to those field at the next reaping , Hathi ? ''
`` They be reap by me and by my three son , '' say Hathi .
`` And to the ploughing that follow the reaping ? ''
say Mowgli .
`` There be no ploughing , '' say Hathi .
`` And to the men that live by the green crop on the ground ? ''
say Mowgli .
`` They go away . ''
`` And to the hut in which the men sleep ? ''
say Mowgli .
`` We tear the roof to piece , and the Jungle swallow up the wall , '' say Hathi .
`` And what more ? ''
say Mowgli .
`` As much good ground a I can walk over in two night from the east to the west , and from the north to the south as much a I can walk over in three night , the Jungle take .
We let in the Jungle upon five village ; and in those village , and in their land , the grazing-ground and the soft crop-grounds , there be not one man to-day who take his food from the ground .
That be the Sack of the Fields of Bhurtpore , which I and my three son do ; and now I ask , Man-cub , how the news of it come to thee ? ''
say Hathi .
`` A man tell me , and now I see even Buldeo can speak truth .
It be well do , Hathi with the white mark ; but the second time it shall be do well , for the reason that there be a man to direct .
Thou knowest the village of the Man-Pack that cast me out ?
They be idle , senseless , and cruel ; they play with their mouth , and they do not kill the weak for food , but for sport .
When they be full-fed they would throw their own breed into the Red Flower .
This I have see .
It be not well that they should live here any more .
I hate them ! ''
`` Kill , then , '' say the young of Hathi 's three son , pick up a tuft of grass , dust it against his fore-legs , and throw it away , while his little red eye glance furtively from side to side .
`` What good be white bone to me ? ''
Mowgli answer angrily .
`` Am I the cub of a wolf to play in the sun with a raw head ?
I have kill Shere Khan , and his hide rot on the Council Rock ; but -- but I do not know whither Shere Khan be go , and my stomach be still empty .
Now I will take that which I can see and touch .
Let in the Jungle upon that village , Hathi ! ''
Bagheera shiver , and cower down .
He could understand , if the bad come to the bad , a quick rush down the village street , and a right and leave blow into a crowd , or a crafty killing of men a they plough in the twilight ; but this scheme for deliberately blot out an entire village from the eye of man and beast frighten him .
Now he saw why Mowgli have send for Hathi .
No one but the long-lived elephant could plan and carry through such a war .
`` Let them run a the men run from the field of Bhurtpore , till we have the rain-water for the only plough , and the noise of the rain on the thick leave for the pattering of their spindle -- till Bagheera and I lair in the house of the Brahmin , and the buck drink at the tank behind the temple !
Let in the Jungle , Hathi ! ''
`` But I -- but we have no quarrel with them , and it need the red rage of great pain ere we tear down the place where men sleep , '' say Hathi doubtfully .
`` Are ye the only eater of grass in the Jungle ?
Drive in your people .
Let the deer and the pig and the nilghai look to it .
Ye need never show a hand 's - breadth of hide till the field be naked .
Let in the Jungle , Hathi ! ''
`` There will be no killing ?
My tusk be red at the Sack of the Fields of Bhurtpore , and I would not wake that smell again . ''
`` Nor I. I do not wish even their bone to lie on the clean earth .
Let them go and find a fresh lair .
They can not stay here .
I have see and smell the blood of the woman that give me food -- the woman whom they would have kill but for me .
Only the smell of the new grass on their door-steps can take away that smell .
It burn in my mouth .
Let in the Jungle , Hathi ! ''
`` Ah ! ''
say Hathi .
`` So do the scar of the stake burn on my hide till we watch the village die under in the spring growth .
Now I see .
Thy war shall be our war .
We will let in the jungle ! ''
Mowgli have hardly time to catch his breath -- he be shake all over with rage and hate before the place where the elephant have stand be empty , and Bagheera be look at him with terror .
`` By the Broken Lock that free me ! ''
say the Black Panther at last .
`` Art THOU the naked thing I speak for in the Pack when all be young ?
Master of the Jungle , when my strength go , speak for me -- speak for Baloo -- speak for u all !
We be cubs before thee !
Snapped twig under foot !
Fawns that have lose their doe ! ''
The idea of Bagheera be a stray fawn upset Mowgli altogether , and he laugh and catch his breath , and sob and laugh again , till he have to jump into a pool to make himself stop .
Then he swim round and round , duck in and out of the bar of the moonlight like the frog , his namesake .
By this time Hathi and his three son have turn , each to one point of the compass , and be stride silently down the valley a mile away .
They go on and on for two day ' march -- that be to say , a long sixty mile -- through the Jungle ; and every step they take , and every wave of their trunk , be know and note and talk over by Mang and Chil and the Monkey People and all the bird .
Then they begin to fee , and feed quietly for a week or so .
Hathi and his son be like Kaa , the Rock Python .
They never hurry till they have to .
At the end of that time -- and none knew who have start it -- a rumour go through the Jungle that there be good food and water to be find in such and such a valley .
The pig -- who , of course , will go to the end of the earth for a full meal -- move first by company , scuffle over the rock , and the deer follow , with the small wild fox that live on the dead and dying of the herd ; and the heavy-shouldered nilghai move parallel with the deer , and the wild buffalo of the swamp come after the nilghai .
The least little thing would have turn the scattered , straggle drove that graze and saunter and drank and graze again ; but whenever there be an alarm some one would rise up and soothe them .
At one time it would be Ikki the Porcupine , full of news of good feed just a little farther on ; at another Mang would cry cheerily and flap down a glade to show it be all empty ; or Baloo , his mouth full of root , would shamble alongside a wavering line and half frighten , half romp it clumsily back to the proper road .
Very many creature break back or run away or lose interest , but very many be leave to go forward .
At the end of another ten day or so the situation be this .
The deer and the pig and the nilghai be mill round and round in a circle of eight or ten mile radius , while the Eaters of Flesh skirmish round it edge .
And the centre of that circle be the village , and round the village the crop be ripen , and in the crop sit men on what they call machans -- platform like pigeon-perches , make of stick at the top of four pole -- to scare away bird and other stealer .
Then the deer be coaxed no more .
The Eaters of Flesh be close behind them , and force them forward and inward .
It be a dark night when Hathi and his three son slip down from the Jungle , and break off the pole of the machans with their trunk ; they fell a a snapped stalk of hemlock in bloom fall , and the men that tumble from them hear the deep gurgling of the elephant in their ear .
Then the vanguard of the bewildered army of the deer break down and flood into the village grazing-grounds and the ploughed field ; and the sharp-hoofed , root wild pig come with them , and what the deer leave the pig spoil , and from time to time an alarm of wolf would shake the herd , and they would rush to and fro desperately , tread down the young barley , and cut flat the bank of the irrigating channel .
Before the dawn break the pressure on the outside of the circle give way at one point .
The Eaters of Flesh have fall back and leave an open path to the south , and drive upon drove of buck flee along it .
Others , who be bolder , lay up in the thicket to finish their meal next night .
But the work be practically do .
When the villager look in the morning they saw their crop be lose .
And that mean death if they do not get away , for they live year in and year out a near to starvation a the Jungle be near to them .
When the buffalo be send to graze the hungry brute find that the deer have clear the grazing-grounds , and so wander into the Jungle and drift off with their wild mate ; and when twilight fell the three or four pony that belong to the village lay in their stable with their head beat in .
Only Bagheera could have give those stroke , and only Bagheera would have think of insolently drag the last carcass to the open street .
The villager have no heart to make fire in the field that night , so Hathi and his three son go glean among what be leave ; and where Hathi glean there be no need to follow .
The men decide to live on their store seed-corn until the rain have fall , and then to take work a servant till they could catch up with the lost year ; but a the grain-dealer be think of his well-filled crate of corn , and the price he would levy at the sale of it , Hathi 's sharp tusk be pick out the corner of his mud-house , and smash open the big wicker chest , leeped with cow-dung , where the precious stuff lay .
When that last loss be discover , it be the Brahmin 's turn to speak .
He have pray to his own Gods without answer .
It might be , he say , that , unconsciously , the village have offend some one of the Gods of the Jungle , for , beyond doubt , the Jungle be against them .
So they send for the head-man of the near tribe of wander Gonds -- little , wise , and very black hunter , live in the deep Jungle , whose father come of the old race in India -- the aboriginal owner of the land .
They make the Gond welcome with what they have , and he stand on one leg , his bow in his hand , and two or three poison arrow stick through his top-knot , look half afraid and half contemptuously at the anxious villager and their ruin field .
They wish to know whether his Gods -- the Old Gods -- be angry with them and what sacrifice should be offer .
The Gond say nothing , but pick up a trail of the Karela , the vine that bear the bitter wild gourd , and lace it to and fro across the temple door in the face of the staring red Hindu image .
Then he push with his hand in the open air along the road to Khanhiwara , and go back to his Jungle , and watch the Jungle People drift through it .
He know that when the Jungle move only white men can hope to turn it aside .
There be no need to ask his meaning .
The wild gourd would grow where they have worship their God , and the sooner they save themselves the good .
But it be hard to tear a village from it mooring .
They stay on as long a any summer food be leave to them , and they try to gather nut in the Jungle , but shadow with glare eye watch them , and roll before them even at mid-day ; and when they run back afraid to their wall , on the tree-trunks they have pass not five minute before the bark would be strip and chisel with the stroke of some great taloned paw .
The more they keep to their village , the bolder grow the wild thing that gambol and bellow on the grazing-grounds by the Waingunga .
They have no time to patch and plaster the rear wall of the empty byre that back on to the Jungle ; the wild pig trample them down , and the knotty-rooted vine hurry after and throw their elbow over the new-won ground , and the coarse grass bristle behind the vine like the lance of a goblin army follow a retreat .
The unmarried men run away first , and carry the news far and near that the village be doom .
Who could fight , they say , against the Jungle , or the Gods of the Jungle , when the very village cobra have leave his hole in the platform under the peepul-tree ?
So their little commerce with the outside world shrunk a the trodden path across the open grow few and fainter .
At last the nightly trumpetings of Hathi and his three son cease to trouble them ; for they have no more to be rob of .
The crop on the ground and the seed in the ground have be take .
The outlying field be already lose their shape , and it be time to throw themselves on the charity of the English at Khanhiwara .
Native fashion , they delay their departure from one day to another till the first Rains catch them and the unmended roof let in a flood , and the grazing-ground stood ankle deep , and all life come on with a rush after the heat of the summer .
Then they wad out -- men , woman , and child -- through the blinding hot rain of the morning , but turn naturally for one farewell look at their home .
They heard , a the last burdened family file through the gate , a crash of fall beam and thatch behind the wall .
They saw a shiny , snaky black trunk lift for an instant , scatter sodden thatch .
It disappear , and there be another crash , follow by a squeal .
Hathi have be pluck off the roof of the hut a you pluck water-lilies , and a rebounding beam have prick him .
He need only this to unchain his full strength , for of all thing in the Jungle the wild elephant enrage be the most wantonly destructive .
He kick backward at a mud wall that crumble at the stroke , and , crumble , melt to yellow mud under the torrent of rain .
Then he wheel and squeal , and tore through the narrow street , lean against the hut right and leave , shiver the crazy door , and crumple up the cave ; while his three son rag behind a they have rag at the Sack of the Fields of Bhurtpore .
`` The Jungle will swallow these shell , '' say a quiet voice in the wreckage .
`` It be the outer wall that must lie down , '' and Mowgli , with the rain sluicing over his bare shoulder and arm , leap back from a wall that be settle like a tired buffalo .
`` All in good time , '' pant Hathi .
`` Oh , but my tusk be red at Bhurtpore ; To the outer wall , child !
With the head !
Together !
Now ! ''
The four push side by side ; the outer wall bulge , split , and fell , and the villager , dumb with horror , saw the savage , clay-streaked head of the wrecker in the ragged gap .
Then they flee , houseless and foodless , down the valley , a their village , shred and toss and trample , melt behind them .
A month later the place be a dimpled mound , cover with soft , green young stuff ; and by the end of the Rains there be the roar jungle in full blast on the spot that have be under plough not six month before .
MOWGLI 'S SONG AGAINST PEOPLE I will let loose against you the fleet-footed vine -- I will call in the Jungle to stamp out your line !
The roof shall fade before it , The house-beams shall fall , And the Karela , the bitter Karela , Shall cover it all !
In the gate of these your council my people shall sing , In the door of these your garner the Bat-folk shall cling ; And the snake shall be your watchman , By a hearthstone unswept ; For the Karela , the bitter Karela , Shall fruit where ye slept !
Ye shall not see my striker ; ye shall hear them and guess ; By night , before the moon-rise , I will send for my ce , And the wolf shall be your herdsman By a landmark remove , For the Karela , the bitter Karela , Shall seed where ye love !
I will reap your field before you at the hand of a host ; Ye shall glean behind my reaper , for the bread that be lose , And the deer shall be your ox By a headland untilled , For the Karela , the bitter Karela , Shall leaf where ye build !
I have untie against you the club-footed vine , I have send in the Jungle to swamp out your line .
The tree -- the tree be on you !
The house-beams shall fall , And the Karela , the bitter Karela , Shall cover you all !
THE UNDERTAKERS When ye say to Tabaqui , `` My Brother ! ''
when ye call the Hyena to meat , Ye may cry the Full Truce with Jacala -- the Belly that run on four foot .
Jungle Law `` Respect the aged ! ''
`` It be a thick voice -- a muddy voice that would have make you shudder -- a voice like something soft breaking in two .
There be a quaver in it , a croak and a whine .
`` Respect the aged !
O Companions of the River -- respect the aged ! ''
Nothing could be see on the broad reach of the river except a little fleet of square-sailed , wooden-pinned barge , load with building-stone , that have just come under the railway bridge , and be drive down-stream .
They put their clumsy helm over to avoid the sand-bar make by the scour of the bridge-piers , and a they pass , three abreast , the horrible voice begin again : `` O Brahmins of the River -- respect the aged and infirm ! ''
A boatman turn where he sit on the gunwale , lift up his hand , say something that be not a blessing , and the boat creak on through the twilight .
The broad Indian river , that look more like a chain of little lake than a stream , be as smooth a glass , reflect the sandy-red sky in mid-channel , but splash with patch of yellow and dusky purple near and under the low bank .
Little creek run into the river in the wet season , but now their dry mouth hang clear above water-line .
On the left shore , and almost under the railway bridge , stand a mud-and-brick and thatch-and-stick village , whose main street , full of cattle go back to their byre , run straight to the river , and end in a sort of rude brick pier-head , where people who want to wash could wade in step by step .
That be the Ghaut of the village of Mugger-Ghaut .
Night be fall fast over the field of lentil and rice and cotton in the low-lying ground yearly flood by the river ; over the reed that fringe the elbow of the bend , and the tangled jungle of the grazing-grounds behind the still reeds .
The parrot and crow , who have be chatter and shout over their evening drink , have fly inland to roost , cross the out-going battalion of the flying-foxes ; and cloud upon cloud of water-birds come whistling and `` honking '' to the cover of the reed-beds .
There be geese , barrel-headed and black-backed , teal , widgeon , mallard , and sheldrake , with curlew , and here and there a flamingo .
A lumbering Adjutant-crane bring up the rear , fly a though each slow stroke would be his last .
`` Respect the aged !
Brahmins of the River -- respect the aged ! ''
The Adjutant half turn his head , sheer a little in the direction of the voice , and land stiffly on the sand-bar below the bridge .
Then you saw what a ruffianly brute he really be .
His back view be immensely respectable , for he stand nearly six foot high , and look rather like a very proper bald-headed parson .
In front it be different , for his Ally Sloper-like head and neck have not a feather to them , and there be a horrible raw-skin pouch on his neck under his chin -- a hold-all for the thing his pick-axe beak might steal .
His leg be long and thin and skinny , but he move them delicately , and look at them with pride a he preen down his ashy-gray tail-feathers , glance over the smooth of his shoulder , and stiffen into `` Stand at attention . ''
A mangy little Jackal , who have be yap hungrily on a low bluff , cock up his ear and tail , and scuttered across the shallow to join the Adjutant .
He be the low of his caste -- not that the best of jackal be good for much , but this one be peculiarly low , be half a beggar , half a criminal -- a cleaner-up of village rubbish-heaps , desperately timid or wildly bold , everlastingly hungry , and full of cunning that never do him any good .
`` Ugh ! ''
he say , shake himself dolefully a he land .
`` May the red mange destroy the dog of this village !
I have three bite for each flea upon me , and all because I look -- only look , mark you -- at an old shoe in a cow-byre .
Can I eat mud ? ''
He scratch himself under his left ear .
`` I hear , '' say the Adjutant , in a voice like a blunt saw go through a thick board -- `` I HEARD there be a new-born puppy in that same shoe . ''
`` To hear be one thing ; to know be another , '' say the Jackal , who have a very fair knowledge of proverb , pick up by listen to men round the village fire of an evening .
`` Quite true .
So , to make sure , I take care of that puppy while the dog be busy elsewhere . ''
`` They be VERY busy , '' say the Jackal .
`` Well , I must not go to the village hunt for scrap yet awhile .
And so there truly be a blind puppy in that shoe ? ''
`` It be here , '' say the Adjutant , squint over his beak at his full pouch .
`` A small thing , but acceptable now that charity be dead in the world . ''
`` Ahai !
The world be iron in these day , '' wail the Jackal .
Then his restless eye catch the least possible ripple on the water , and he go on quickly : `` Life be hard for u all , and I doubt not that even our excellent master , the Pride of the Ghaut and the Envy of the River -- '' `` A liar , a flatterer , and a Jackal be all hatch out of the same egg , '' say the Adjutant to nobody in particular ; for he be rather a fine sort of a liar on his own account when he take the trouble .
`` Yes , the Envy of the River , '' the Jackal repeat , raise his voice .
`` Even he , I doubt not , find that since the bridge have be build good food be more scarce .
But on the other hand , though I would by no mean say this to his noble face , he be so wise and so virtuous -- a I , alas I be not -- '' `` When the Jackal own he be gray , how black must the Jackal be ! ''
mutter the Adjutant .
He could not see what be come .
`` That his food never fail , and in consequence -- '' There be a soft grating sound , a though a boat have just touch in shoal water .
The Jackal spun round quickly and face -LRB- it be always best to face -RRB- the creature he have be talk about .
It be a twenty-four-foot crocodile , case in what look like treble-riveted boiler-plate , stud and keel and crest ; the yellow point of his upper teeth just overhang his beautifully flute low jaw .
It be the blunt-nosed Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut , old than any man in the village , who have give his name to the village ; the demon of the ford before the railway bridge , come -- murderer , man-eater , and local fetish in one .
He lay with his chin in the shallow , keep his place by an almost invisible rippling of his tail , and well the Jackal know that one stroke of that same tail in the water would carry the Mugger up the bank with the rush of a steam-engine .
`` Auspiciously meet , Protector of the Poor ! ''
he fawn , back at every word .
`` A delectable voice be hear , and we come in the hope of sweet conversation .
My tailless presumption , while wait here , lead me , indeed , to speak of thee .
It be my hope that nothing be overheard . ''
Now the Jackal have speak just to be listen to , for he know flattery be the best way of get thing to eat , and the Mugger know that the Jackal have speak for this end , and the Jackal know that the Mugger know , and the Mugger know that the Jackal know that the Mugger know , and so they be all very content together .
The old brute push and pant and grunt up the bank , mumbling , `` Respect the aged and infirm ! ''
and all the time his little eye burn like coal under the heavy , horny eyelid on the top of his triangular head , a he shove his bloated barrel-body along between his crutched leg .
Then he settle down , and , accustom a the Jackal be to his way , he could not help starting , for the hundredth time , when he saw how exactly the Mugger imitate a log adrift on the bar .
He have even take pain to lie at the exact angle a naturally strand log would make with the water , have regard to the current of the season at the time and place .
All this be only a matter of habit , of course , because the Mugger have come ashore for pleasure ; but a crocodile be never quite full , and if the Jackal have be deceive by the likeness he would not have live to philosophise over it .
`` My child , I hear nothing , '' say the Mugger , shut one eye .
`` The water be in my ear , and also I be faint with hunger .
Since the railway bridge be build my people at my village have cease to love me ; and that be break my heart . ''
`` Ah , shame ! ''
say the Jackal .
`` So noble a heart , too !
But men be all alike , to my mind . ''
`` Nay , there be very great difference indeed , '' the Mugger answer gently .
`` Some be as lean a boat-poles .
Others again be fat a young ja -- dog .
Never would I causelessly revile men .
They be of all fashion , but the long year have show me that , one with another , they be very good .
Men , woman , and child -- I have no fault to find with them .
And remember , child , he who rebuke the World be rebuke by the World . ''
`` Flattery be bad than an empty tin can in the belly .
But that which we have just hear be wisdom , '' say the Adjutant , bring down one foot .
`` Consider , though , their ingratitude to this excellent one , '' begin the Jackal tenderly .
`` Nay , nay , not ingratitude ! ''
the Mugger say .
`` They do not think for others ; that be all .
But I have notice , lie at my station below the ford , that the stair of the new bridge be cruelly hard to climb , both for old people and young child .
The old , indeed , be not so worthy of consideration , but I be grieve -- I be truly grieve -- on account of the fat child .
Still , I think , in a little while , when the newness of the bridge have wear away , we shall see my people 's bare brown leg bravely splash through the ford a before .
Then the old Mugger will be honour again . ''
`` But surely I saw Marigold wreath float off the edge of the Ghaut only this noon , '' say the Adjutant .
Marigold wreath be a sign of reverence all India over .
`` An error -- an error .
It be the wife of the sweetmeat-seller .
She lose her eyesight year by year , and can not tell a log from me -- the Mugger of the Ghaut .
I saw the mistake when she throw the garland , for I be lie at the very foot of the Ghaut , and have she take another step I might have show her some little difference .
Yet she mean well , and we must consider the spirit of the offering . ''
`` What good be marigold wreath when one be on the rubbish-heap ? ''
say the Jackal , hunt for flea , but keep one wary eye on his Protector of the Poor .
`` True , but they have not yet begin to make the rubbish-heap that shall carry ME .
Five time have I see the river draw back from the village and make new land at the foot of the street .
Five time have I see the village rebuilt on the bank , and I shall see it build yet five time more .
I be no faithless , fish-hunting Gavial , I , at Kasi to-day and Prayag to-morrow , a the saying be , but the true and constant watcher of the ford .
It be not for nothing , child , that the village bear my name , and ` he who watch long , ' a the saying be , ` shall at last have his reward . ' '' ''
I have watch long -- very long -- nearly all my life , and my reward have be bite and blow , '' say the Jackal .
`` Ho !
ho !
ho ! ''
roar the Adjutant .
`` In August be the Jackal born ; The Rains fell in September ; ` Now such a fearful flood a this , ' Says he , ' I ca n't remember ! ' ''
There be one very unpleasant peculiarity about the Adjutant .
At uncertain time he suffer from acute attack of the fidget or cramp in his leg , and though he be more virtuous to behold than any of the crane , who be all immensely respectable , he fly off into wild , cripple-stilt war-dances , half open his wing and bob his bald head up and down ; while for reason best know to himself he be very careful to time his bad attack with his nasty remark .
At the last word of his song he come to attention again , ten time adjutaunter than before .
The Jackal wince , though he be full three season old , but you can not resent an insult from a person with a beak a yard long , and the power of drive it like a javelin .
The Adjutant be a most notorious coward , but the Jackal be bad .
`` We must live before we can learn , '' say the Mugger , `` and there be this to say : Little jackal be very common , child , but such a mugger a I be be not common .
For all that , I be not proud , since pride be destruction ; but take notice , it be Fate , and against his Fate no one who swim or walk or run should say anything at all .
I be well content with Fate .
With good luck , a keen eye , and the custom of consider whether a creek or a backwater have an outlet to it ere you ascend , much may be do . ''
`` Once I hear that even the Protector of the Poor make a mistake , '' say the Jackal viciously .
`` True ; but there my Fate help me .
It be before I have come to my full growth -- before the last famine but three -LRB- by the Right and Left of Gunga , how full use the stream to be in those day ! -RRB-
.
Yes , I be young and unthinking , and when the flood come , who so pleased a I ?
A little made me very happy then .
The village be deep in flood , and I swim above the Ghaut and go far inland , up to the rice-fields , and they be deep in good mud .
I remember also a pair of bracelet -LRB- glass they be , and trouble me not a little -RRB- that I find that evening .
Yes , glass bracelet ; and , if my memory serve me well , a shoe .
I should have shake off both shoe , but I be hungry .
I learn well later .
Yes .
And so I feed and rest me ; but when I be ready to go to the river again the flood have fall , and I walk through the mud of the main street .
Who but I ?
Came out all my people , priest and woman and child , and I look upon them with benevolence .
The mud be not a good place to fight in .
Said a boatman , ` Get ax and kill him , for he be the Mugger of the ford . '
` Not so , ' say the Brahmin .
` Look , he be drive the flood before him !
He be the godling of the village . '
Then they throw many flower at me , and by happy thought one lead a goat across the road . ''
`` How good -- how very good be goat ! ''
say the Jackal .
`` Hairy -- too hairy , and when find in the water more than likely to hide a cross-shaped hook .
But that goat I accept , and go down to the Ghaut in great honour .
Later , my Fate send me the boatman who have desire to cut off my tail with an axe .
His boat ground upon an old shoal which you would not remember . ''
`` We be not ALL jackal here , '' say the Adjutant .
`` Was it the shoal make where the stone-boats sank in the year of the great drouth -- a long shoal that last three flood ? ''
`` There be two , '' say the Mugger ; `` an upper and a low shoal . ''
`` Ay , I forget .
A channel divide them , and later dry up again , '' say the Adjutant , who pride himself on his memory .
`` On the low shoal my well-wisher 's craft ground .
He be sleep in the bow , and , half awake , leap over to his waist -- no , it be no more than to his knee -- to push off .
His empty boat go on and touch again below the next reach , a the river run then .
I follow , because I know men would come out to drag it ashore . ''
`` And do they do so ? ''
say the Jackal , a little awe-stricken .
This be hunt on a scale that impress him .
`` There and low down they do .
I go no farther , but that give me three in one day -- well-fed manjis -LRB- boatman -RRB- all , and , except in the case of the last -LRB- then I be careless -RRB- , never a cry to warn those on the bank . ''
`` Ah , noble sport !
But what cleverness and great judgment it require ! ''
say the Jackal .
`` Not cleverness , child , but only think .
A little thought in life be like salt upon rice , a the boatman say , and I have think deeply always .
The Gavial , my cousin , the fish-eater , have tell me how hard it be for him to follow his fish , and how one fish differs from the other , and how he must know them all , both together and apart .
I say that be wisdom ; but , on the other hand , my cousin , the Gavial , live among his people .
MY people do not swim in company , with their mouth out of the water , a Rewa do ; nor do they constantly rise to the surface of the water , and turn over on their side , like Mohoo and little Chapta ; nor do they gather in shoal after flood , like Batchua and Chilwa . ''
`` All be very good eating , '' say the Adjutant , clatter his beak .
`` So my cousin say , and make a great to-do over hunt them , but they do not climb the bank to escape his sharp nose .
MY people be otherwise .
Their life be on the land , in the house , among the cattle .
I must know what they do , and what they be about to do ; and add the tail to the trunk , a the saying be , I make up the whole elephant .
Is there a green branch and an iron ring hang over a doorway ?
The old Mugger know that a boy have be bear in that house , and must some day come down to the Ghaut to play .
Is a maiden to be marry ?
The old Mugger know , for he see the men carry gift back and forth ; and she , too , come down to the Ghaut to bathe before her wedding , and -- he be there .
Has the river change it channel , and make new land where there be only sand before ?
The Mugger know . ''
`` Now , of what use be that knowledge ? ''
say the Jackal .
`` The river have shift even in my little life . ''
Indian river be nearly always move about in their bed , and will shift , sometimes , as much a two or three mile in a season , drown the field on one bank , and spread good silt on the other .
`` There be no knowledge so useful , '' say the Mugger , `` for new land mean new quarrel .
The Mugger know .
Oho !
the Mugger know .
As soon a the water have drain off , he creep up the little creek that men think would not hide a dog , and there he wait .
Presently come a farmer say he will plant cucumber here , and melon there , in the new land that the river have give him .
He feel the good mud with his bare toe .
Anon come another , say he will put onion , and carrot , and sugar-cane in such and such place .
They meet a boat adrift meet , and each roll his eye at the other under the big blue turban .
The old Mugger see and hears .
Each call the other ` Brother , ' and they go to mark out the boundary of the new land .
The Mugger hurry with them from point to point , shuffle very low through the mud .
Now they begin to quarrel !
Now they say hot word !
Now they pull turban !
Now they lift up their lathis -LRB- club -RRB- , and , at last , one fall backward into the mud , and the other run away .
When he come back the dispute be settle , a the iron-bound bamboo of the loser witness .
Yet they be not grateful to the Mugger .
No , they cry ` Murder ! '
and their family fight with stick , twenty a-side .
My people be good people -- upland Jats -- Malwais of the Bet .
They do not give blow for sport , and , when the fight be do , the old Mugger wait far down the river , out of sight of the village , behind the kikar-scrub yonder .
Then come they down , my broad-shouldered Jats -- eight or nine together under the star , bear the dead man upon a bed .
They be old men with gray beard , and voice as deep a mine .
They light a little fire -- ah !
how well I know that fire !
-- and they drink tobacco , and they nod their head together forward in a ring , or sideways toward the dead man upon the bank .
They say the English Law will come with a rope for this matter , and that such a man 's family will be ashamed , because such a man must be hang in the great square of the Jail .
Then say the friend of the dead , ` Let him hang ! '
and the talk be all to do over again -- once , twice , twenty time in the long night .
Then say one , at last , ` The fight be a fair fight .
Let u take blood-money , a little more than be offer by the slayer , and we will say no more about it . '
Then do they haggle over the blood-money , for the dead be a strong man , leave many son .
Yet before amratvela -LRB- sunrise -RRB- they put the fire to him a little , a the custom be , and the dead man come to me , and HE say no more about it .
Aha !
my child , the Mugger know -- the Mugger know -- and my Malwah Jats be a good people ! ''
`` They be too close -- too narrow in the hand for my crop , '' croak the Adjutant .
`` They waste not the polish on the cow 's horn , a the saying be ; and , again , who can glean after a Malwai ? ''
`` Ah , I -- glean -- THEM , '' say the Mugger .
`` Now , in Calcutta of the South , in the old day , '' the Adjutant go on , `` everything be throw into the street , and we pick and choose .
Those wear dainty season .
But to-day they keep their street as clean a the outside of an egg , and my people fly away .
To be clean be one thing ; to dust , sweep , and sprinkle seven time a day weary the very Gods themselves . ''
`` There be a down-country jackal have it from a brother , who tell me , that in Calcutta of the South all the jackal be as fat a otter in the Rains , '' say the Jackal , his mouth watering at the bare thought of it .
`` Ah , but the white-faces be there -- the English , and they bring dog from somewhere down the river in boat -- big fat dog -- to keep those same jackal lean , '' say the Adjutant .
`` They be , then , as hard-hearted a these people ?
I might have know .
Neither earth , sky , nor water show charity to a jackal .
I saw the tent of a white-face last season , after the Rains , and I also take a new yellow bridle to eat .
The white-faces do not dress their leather in the proper way .
It make me very sick . ''
`` That be good than my case , '' say the Adjutant .
`` When I be in my third season , a young and a bold bird , I go down to the river where the big boat come in .
The boat of the English be thrice as big a this village . ''
`` He have be as far a Delhi , and say all the people there walk on their head , '' mutter the Jackal .
The Mugger open his left eye , and look keenly at the Adjutant .
`` It be true , '' the big bird insist .
`` A liar only lie when he hop to be believe .
No one who have not see those boat COULD believe this truth . ''
`` THAT be more reasonable , '' say the Mugger .
`` And then ? ''
`` From the inside of this boat they be take out great piece of white stuff , which , in a little while , turn to water .
Much split off , and fell about on the shore , and the rest they swiftly put into a house with thick wall .
But a boatman , who laugh , take a piece no large than a small dog , and throw it to me .
I -- all my people -- swallow without reflection , and that piece I swallow a be our custom .
Immediately I be afflict with an excessive cold which , begin in my crop , run down to the extreme end of my toe , and deprive me even of speech , while the boatman laugh at me .
Never have I felt such cold .
I dance in my grief and amazement till I could recover my breath and then I dance and cry out against the falseness of this world ; and the boatman deride me till they fell down .
The chief wonder of the matter , set aside that marvellous coldness , be that there be nothing at all in my crop when I have finish my lamentings ! ''
The Adjutant have do his very best to describe his feeling after swallow a seven-pound lump of Wenham Lake ice , off an American ice-ship , in the day before Calcutta make her ice by machinery ; but a he do not know what ice be , and a the Mugger and the Jackal know rather less , the tale miss fire .
`` Anything , '' say the Mugger , shut his left eye again -- `` ANYTHING be possible that come out of a boat thrice the size of Mugger-Ghaut .
My village be not a small one . ''
There be a whistle overhead on the bridge , and the Delhi Mail slid across , all the carriage gleam with light , and the shadow faithfully follow along the river .
It clank away into the dark again ; but the Mugger and the Jackal be so well use to it that they never turn their head .
`` Is that anything less wonderful than a boat thrice the size of Mugger-Ghaut ? ''
say the bird , look up .
`` I saw that build , child .
Stone by stone I saw the bridge-piers rise , and when the men fell off -LRB- they be wondrous sure-footed for the most part -- but WHEN they fell -RRB- I be ready .
After the first pier be make they never think to look down the stream for the body to burn .
There , again , I save much trouble .
There be nothing strange in the building of the bridge , '' say the Mugger .
`` But that which go across , pull the roofed cart !
That be strange , '' the Adjutant repeat .
`` It be , past any doubt , a new breed of bullock .
Some day it will not be able to keep it foothold up yonder , and will fall a the men do .
The old Mugger will then be ready . ''
The Jackal look at the Adjutant and the Adjutant look at the Jackal .
If there be one thing they be more certain of than another , it be that the engine be everything in the wide world except a bullock .
The Jackal have watch it time and again from the aloe hedge by the side of the line , and the Adjutant have see engine since the first locomotive ran in India .
But the Mugger have only look up at the thing from below , where the brass dome seem rather like a bullock 's hump .
`` M -- yes , a new kind of bullock , '' the Mugger repeat ponderously , to make himself quite sure in his own mind ; and `` Certainly it be a bullock , '' say the Jackal .
`` And again it might be -- '' begin the Mugger pettishly .
`` Certainly -- most certainly , '' say the Jackal , without wait for the other to finish .
`` What ? ''
say the Mugger angrily , for he could feel that the others know more than he do .
`` What might it be ?
I never finish my word .
You say it be a bullock . ''
`` It be anything the Protector of the Poor plea .
I be HIS servant -- not the servant of the thing that cross the river . ''
`` Whatever it be , it be white-face work , '' say the Adjutant ; `` and for my own part , I would not lie out upon a place so near to it a this bar . ''
`` You do not know the English a I do , '' say the Mugger .
`` There be a white-face here when the bridge be build , and he would take a boat in the evening and shuffle with his foot on the bottom-boards , and whisper : ` Is he here ?
Is he there ?
Bring me my gun . '
I could hear him before I could see him -- each sound that he make -- creaking and puffing and rattle his gun , up and down the river .
As surely a I have pick up one of his workman , and thus save great expense in wood for the burning , so surely would he come down to the Ghaut , and shout in a loud voice that he would hunt me , and rid the river of me -- the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut !
ME !
Children , I have swim under the bottom of his boat for hour after hour , and hear him fire his gun at log ; and when I be well sure he be weary , I have rise by his side and snap my jaw in his face .
When the bridge be finish he go away .
All the English hunt in that fashion , except when they be hunt . ''
`` Who hunt the white-faces ? ''
yap the Jackal excitedly .
`` No one now , but I have hunt them in my time . ''
`` I remember a little of that Hunting .
I be young then , '' say the Adjutant , clatter his beak significantly .
`` I be well establish here .
My village be be build for the third time , a I remember , when my cousin , the Gavial , bring me word of rich water above Benares .
At first I would not go , for my cousin , who be a fish-eater , do not always know the good from the bad ; but I hear my people talk in the evening , and what they say make me certain . ''
`` And what do they say ? ''
the Jackal ask .
`` They say enough to make me , the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut , leave water and take to my foot .
I go by night , use the little stream a they serve me ; but it be the beginning of the hot weather , and all stream be low .
I cross dusty road ; I go through tall grass ; I climb hill in the moonlight .
Even rock do I climb , child -- consider this well .
I cross the tail of Sirhind , the waterless , before I could find the set of the little river that flow Gungaward .
I be a month 's journey from my own people and the river that I know .
That be very marvellous ! ''
`` What food on the way ? ''
say the Jackal , who keep his soul in his little stomach , and be not a bit impressed by the Mugger 's land travel .
`` That which I could find -- COUSIN , '' say the Mugger slowly , drag each word .
Now you do not call a man a cousin in India unless you think you can establish some kind of blood-relationship , and a it be only in old fairy-tales that the Mugger ever marry a jackal , the Jackal know for what reason he have be suddenly lift into the Mugger 's family circle .
If they have be alone he would not have care , but the Adjutant 's eye twinkle with mirth at the ugly jest .
`` Assuredly , Father , I might have know , '' say the Jackal .
A mugger do not care to be call a father of jackal , and the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut say a much -- and a great deal more which there be no use in repeat here .
`` The Protector of the Poor have claim kinship .
How can I remember the precise degree ?
Moreover , we eat the same food .
He have say it , '' be the Jackal 's reply .
That make matter rather bad , for what the Jackal hint at be that the Mugger must have eat his food on that land-march fresh and fresh every day , instead of keep it by him till it be in a fit and proper condition , a every self-respecting mugger and most wild beast do when they can .
Indeed , one of the bad term of contempt along the River-bed be `` eater of fresh meat . ''
It be nearly as bad a call a man a cannibal .
`` That food be eat thirty season ago , '' say the Adjutant quietly .
`` If we talk for thirty season more it will never come back .
Tell u , now , what happen when the good water be reach after thy most wonderful land journey .
If we listen to the howling of every jackal the business of the town would stop , a the saying be . ''
The Mugger must have be grateful for the interruption , because he go on , with a rush : `` By the Right and Left of Gunga !
when I come there never do I see such water ! ''
`` Were they good , then , than the big flood of last season ? ''
say the Jackal .
`` Better !
That flood be no more than come every five year -- a handful of drowned stranger , some chicken , and a dead bullock in muddy water with cross-currents .
But the season I think of , the river be low , smooth , and even , and , a the Gavial have warn me , the dead English come down , touch each other .
I get my girth in that season -- my girth and my depth .
From Agra , by Etawah and the broad water by Allahabad -- '' `` Oh , the eddy that set under the wall of the fort at Allahabad ! ''
say the Adjutant .
`` They come in there like widgeon to the reed , and round and round they swing -- thus ! ''
He go off into his horrible dance again , while the Jackal look on enviously .
He naturally could not remember the terrible year of the Mutiny they be talk about .
The Mugger continue : `` Yes , by Allahabad one lay still in the slack-water and let twenty go by to pick one ; and , above all , the English be not cumber with jewellery and nose-rings and anklet a my woman be nowadays .
To delight in ornament be to end with a rope for a necklace , a the saying be .
All the mugger of all the river grow fat then , but it be my Fate to be fat than them all .
The news be that the English be be hunt into the river , and by the Right and Left of Gunga !
we believe it be true .
So far a I go south I believe it to be true ; and I go down-stream beyond Monghyr and the tomb that look over the river . ''
`` I know that place , '' say the Adjutant .
`` Since those day Monghyr be a lost city .
Very few live there now . ''
`` Thereafter I work up-stream very slowly and lazily , and a little above Monghyr there come down a boatful of white-faces -- alive !
They be , a I remember , woman , lie under a cloth spread over stick , and cry aloud .
There be never a gun fire at u , the watcher of the ford in those day .
All the gun be busy elsewhere .
We could hear them day and night inland , come and go a the wind shift .
I rise up full before the boat , because I have never see white-faces alive , though I know them well -- otherwise .
A naked white child kneel by the side of the boat , and , stoop over , must need try to trail his hand in the river .
It be a pretty thing to see how a child love running water .
I have feed that day , but there be yet a little unfilled space within me .
Still , it be for sport and not for food that I rise at the child 's hand .
They be so clear a mark that I do not even look when I close ; but they be so small that though my jaw rang true -- I be sure of that -- the child draw them up swiftly , unhurt .
They must have pass between tooth and tooth -- those small white hand .
I should have catch him cross-wise at the elbow ; but , a I say , it be only for sport and desire to see new thing that I rise at all .
They cry out one after another in the boat , and presently I rise again to watch them .
The boat be too heavy to push over .
They be only woman , but he who trust a woman will walk on duckweed in a pool , a the saying be : and by the Right and Left of Gunga , that be truth ! ''
`` Once a woman give me some dry skin from a fish , '' say the Jackal .
`` I have hop to get her baby , but horse-food be well than the kick of a horse , a the saying be .
What do thy woman do ? ''
`` She fire at me with a short gun of a kind I have never see before or since .
Five time , one after another '' -LRB- the Mugger must have meet with an old-fashioned revolver -RRB- ; `` and I stay open-mouthed and gaping , my head in the smoke .
Never do I see such a thing .
Five time , as swiftly a I wave my tail -- thus ! ''
The Jackal , who have be grow more and more interested in the story , have just time to leap back a the huge tail swung by like a scythe .
`` Not before the fifth shot , '' say the Mugger , a though he have never dream of stun one of his listener -- `` not before the fifth shot do I sink , and I rise in time to hear a boatman tell all those white woman that I be most certainly dead .
One bullet have go under a neck-plate of mine .
I know not if it be there still , for the reason I can not turn my head .
Look and see , child .
It will show that my tale be true . ''
`` I ? ''
say the Jackal .
`` Shall an eater of old shoe , a bone-cracker , presume , to doubt the word of the Envy of the River ?
May my tail be bite off by blind puppy if the shadow of such a thought have cross my humble mind !
The Protector of the Poor have condescend to inform me , his slave , that once in his life he have be wound by a woman .
That be sufficient , and I will tell the tale to all my child , ask for no proof . ''
`` Over-much civility be sometimes no good than over-much discourtesy , for , a the saying be , one can choke a guest with curd .
I do NOT desire that any child of thine should know that the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut take his only wound from a woman .
They will have much else to think of if they get their meat as miserably a do their father . ''
`` It be forget long ago !
It be never say !
There never be a white woman !
There be no boat !
Nothing whatever happen at all . ''
The Jackal wave his brush to show how completely everything be wipe out of his memory , and sit down with an air .
`` Indeed , very many thing happen , '' say the Mugger , beaten in his second attempt that night to get the good of his friend .
-LRB- Neither bore malice , however .
Eat and be eat be fair law along the river , and the Jackal come in for his share of plunder when the Mugger have finish a meal . -RRB-
`` I leave that boat and go up-stream , and , when I have reach Arrah and the back-waters behind it , there be no more dead English .
The river be empty for a while .
Then come one or two dead , in red coat , not English , but of one kind all -- Hindus and Purbeeahs -- then five and six abreast , and at last , from Arrah to the North beyond Agra , it be a though whole village have walk into the water .
They come out of little creek one after another , a the log come down in the Rains .
When the river rise they rise also in company from the shoal they have rest upon ; and the fall flood drag them with it across the field and through the Jungle by the long hair .
All night , too , go North , I hear the gun , and by day the shod foot of men cross ford , and that noise which a heavy cart-wheel make on sand under water ; and every ripple bring more dead .
At last even I be afraid , for I say : ` If this thing happen to men , how shall the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut escape ? '
There be boat , too , that come up behind me without sail , burn continually , a the cotton-boats sometimes burn , but never sinking . ''
`` Ah ! ''
say the Adjutant .
`` Boats like those come to Calcutta of the South .
They be tall and black , they beat up the water behind them with a tail , and they -- '' `` Are thrice as big a my village .
MY boat be low and white ; they beat up the water on either side of them and be no large than the boat of one who speak truth should be .
They make me very afraid , and I leave water and go back to this my river , hiding by day and walking by night , when I could not find little stream to help me .
I come to my village again , but I do not hope to see any of my people there .
Yet they be plough and sow and reaping , and go to and fro in their field , as quietly a their own cattle . ''
`` Was there still good food in the river ? ''
say the Jackal .
`` More than I have any desire for .
Even I -- and I do not eat mud -- even I be tire , and , a I remember , a little frightened of this constant come down of the silent one .
I hear my people say in my village that all the English be dead ; but those that come , face down , with the current be NOT English , a my people saw .
Then my people say that it be best to say nothing at all , but to pay the tax and plough the land .
After a long time the river clear , and those that come down it have be clearly drown by the flood , a I could well see ; and though it be not so easy then to get food , I be heartily glad of it .
A little killing here and there be no bad thing -- but even the Mugger be sometimes satisfied , a the saying be . ''
`` Marvellous !
Most truly marvellous ! ''
say the Jackal .
`` I be become fat through merely hear about so much good eating .
And afterward what , if it be permit to ask , do the Protector of the Poor do ? ''
`` I say to myself -- and by the Right and Left of Gunga !
I lock my jaw on that vow -- I say I would never go rove any more .
So I live by the Ghaut , very close to my own people , and I watch over them year after year ; and they love me so much that they throw marigold wreath at my head whenever they saw it lift .
Yes , and my Fate have be very kind to me , and the river be good enough to respect my poor and infirm presence ; only -- '' `` No one be all happy from his beak to his tail , '' say the Adjutant sympathetically .
`` What do the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut need more ? ''
`` That little white child which I do not get , '' say the Mugger , with a deep sigh .
`` He be very small , but I have not forget .
I be old now , but before I die it be my desire to try one new thing .
It be true they be a heavy-footed , noisy , and foolish people , and the sport would be small , but I remember the old day above Benares , and , if the child live , he will remember still .
It may be he go up and down the bank of some river , tell how he once pass his hand between the teeth of the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut , and live to make a tale of it .
My Fate have be very kind , but that plague me sometimes in my dream -- the thought of the little white child in the bow of that boat . ''
He yawn , and close his jaw .
`` And now I will rest and think .
Keep silent , my child , and respect the aged . ''
He turn stiffly , and shuffle to the top of the sand-bar , while the Jackal draw back with the Adjutant to the shelter of a tree strand on the end near the railway bridge .
`` That be a pleasant and profitable life , '' he grin , look up inquiringly at the bird who tower above him .
`` And not once , mark you , do he think fit to tell me where a morsel might have be leave along the bank .
Yet I have tell HIM a hundred time of good thing wallow down-stream .
How true be the say , ` All the world forget the Jackal and the Barber when the news have be tell ! '
Now he be go to sleep !
Arrh ! ''
`` How can a jackal hunt with a Mugger ? ''
say the Adjutant coolly .
`` Big thief and little thief ; it be easy to say who get the picking . ''
The Jackal turn , whine impatiently , and be go to curl himself up under the tree-trunk , when suddenly he cower , and look up through the draggled branch at the bridge almost above his head .
`` What now ? ''
say the Adjutant , open his wing uneasily .
`` Wait till we see .
The wind blow from u to them , but they be not look for u -- those two men . ''
`` Men , be it ?
My office protect me .
All India know I be holy . ''
The Adjutant , be a first-class scavenger , be allow to go where he please , and so this one never flinch .
`` I be not worth a blow from anything good than an old shoe , '' say the Jackal , and listen again .
`` Hark to that footfall ! ''
he go on .
`` That be no country leather , but the shod foot of a white-face .
Listen again !
Iron hit iron up there !
It be a gun !
Friend , those heavy-footed , foolish English be come to speak with the Mugger . ''
`` Warn him , then .
He be call Protector of the Poor by some one not unlike a starving Jackal but a little time ago . ''
`` Let my cousin protect his own hide .
He have tell me again and again there be nothing to fear from the white-faces .
They must be white-faces .
Not a villager of Mugger-Ghaut would dare to come after him .
See , I say it be a gun !
Now , with good luck , we shall fee before daylight .
He can not hear well out of water , and -- this time it be not a woman ! ''
A shiny barrel glitter for a minute in the moonlight on the girder .
The Mugger be lie on the sand-bar as still a his own shadow , his fore-feet spread out a little , his head drop between them , snore like a -- mugger .
A voice on the bridge whisper : `` It 's an odd shot -- straight down almost -- but as safe a house .
Better try behind the neck .
Golly !
what a brute !
The villager will be wild if he 's shot , though .
He 's the deota -LSB- godling -RSB- of these part . ''
`` Do n't care a rap , '' another voice answer ; `` he take about fifteen of my best cooly while the bridge be building , and it 's time he be put a stop to .
I 've be after him in a boat for week .
Stand by with the Martini as soon a I 've give him both barrel of this . ''
`` Mind the kick , then .
A double four-bore 's no joke . ''
`` That 's for him to decide .
Here go ! ''
There be a roar like the sound of a small cannon -LRB- the big sort of elephant-rifle be not very different from some artillery -RRB- , and a double streak of flame , follow by the stinging crack of a Martini , whose long bullet make nothing of a crocodile 's plate .
But the explosive bullet do the work .
One of them strike just behind the Mugger 's neck , a hand 's - breadth to the left of the backbone , while the other burst a little low down , at the beginning of the tail .
In ninety-nine case out of a hundred a mortally-wounded crocodile can scramble to deep water and get away ; but the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut be literally break into three piece .
He hardly move his head before the life go out of him , and he lay as flat a the Jackal .
`` Thunder and lightning !
Lightning and thunder ! ''
say that miserable little beast .
`` Has the thing that pull the covered cart over the bridge tumble at last ? ''
`` It be no more than a gun , '' say the Adjutant , though his very tail-feathers quiver .
`` Nothing more than a gun .
He be certainly dead .
Here come the white-faces . ''
The two Englishmen have hurry down from the bridge and across to the sand-bar , where they stand admire the length of the Mugger .
Then a native with an axe cut off the big head , and four men drag it across the spit .
`` The last time that I have my hand in a Mugger 's mouth , '' say one of the Englishmen , stoop down -LRB- he be the man who have build the bridge -RRB- , `` it be when I be about five year old -- come down the river by boat to Monghyr .
I be a Mutiny baby , a they call it .
Poor mother be in the boat , too , and she often tell me how she fire dad 's old pistol at the beast 's head . ''
`` Well , you 've certainly have your revenge on the chief of the clan -- even if the gun have make your nose bleed .
Hi , you boatmen !
Haul that head up the bank , and we 'll boil it for the skull .
The skin 's too knock about to keep .
Come along to bed now .
This be worth sit up all night for , be n't it ? ''
***** Curiously enough , the Jackal and the Adjutant make the very same remark not three minute after the men have leave .
A RIPPLE SONG Once a ripple come to land In the golden sunset burning -- Lapped against a maiden 's hand , By the ford returning .
Dainty foot and gentle breast -- Here , across , be glad and rest .
`` Maiden , wait , '' the ripple saith .
`` Wait awhile , for I be Death ! ''
`` Where my lover call I go -- Shame it be to treat him coldly -- 'T be a fish that circle so , Turning over boldly . ''
Dainty foot and tender heart , Wait the loaded ferry-cart .
`` Wait , ah , wait ! ''
the ripple saith ; `` Maiden , wait , for I be Death ! ''
`` When my lover call I haste -- Dame Disdain be never wed ! ''
Ripple-ripple round her waist , Clear the current eddied .
Foolish heart and faithful hand , Little foot that touch no land .
Far away the ripple speed , Ripple -- ripple -- run red !
THE KING 'S ANKUS These be the Four that be never content , that have never be fill since the Dews begin -- Jacala 's mouth , and the glut of the Kite , and the hand of the Ape , and the Eyes of Man .
Jungle Saying .
Kaa , the big Rock Python , have change his skin for perhaps the two-hundredth time since his birth ; and Mowgli , who never forget that he owe his life to Kaa for a night 's work at Cold Lairs , which you may perhaps remember , go to congratulate him .
Skin-changing always make a snake moody and depress till the new skin begin to shine and look beautiful .
Kaa never make fun of Mowgli any more , but accept him , a the other Jungle People do , for the Master of the Jungle , and bring him all the news that a python of his size would naturally hear .
What Kaa do not know about the Middle Jungle , a they call it , -- the life that run close to the earth or under it , the boulder , burrow , and the tree-bole life , -- might have be write upon the small of his scale .
That afternoon Mowgli be sit in the circle of Kaa 's great coil , finger the flaked and broken old skin that lay all loop and twist among the rock just a Kaa have leave it .
Kaa have very courteously pack himself under Mowgli 's broad , bare shoulder , so that the boy be really rest in a living arm-chair .
`` Even to the scale of the eye it be perfect , '' say Mowgli , under his breath , play with the old skin .
`` Strange to see the covering of one 's own head at one 's own foot ! ''
`` Ay , but I lack foot , '' say Kaa ; `` and since this be the custom of all my people , I do not find it strange .
Does thy skin never feel old and harsh ? ''
`` Then go I and wash , Flathead ; but , it be true , in the great heat I have wish I could slough my skin without pain , and run skinless . ''
`` I wash , and ALSO I take off my skin .
How look the new coat ? ''
Mowgli run his hand down the diagonal checkerings of the immense back .
`` The Turtle be harder-backed , but not so gay , '' he say judgmatically .
`` The Frog , my name-bearer , be more gay , but not so hard .
It be very beautiful to see -- like the mottling in the mouth of a lily . ''
`` It need water .
A new skin never come to full colour before the first bath .
Let u go bathe . ''
`` I will carry thee , '' say Mowgli ; and he stoop down , laugh , to lift the middle section of Kaa 's great body , just where the barrel be thickest .
A man might just , as well have try to heave up a two-foot water-main ; and Kaa lay still , puff with quiet amusement .
Then the regular evening game begin -- the Boy in the flush of his great strength , and the Python in his sumptuous new skin , stand up one against the other for a wrestling match -- a trial of eye and strength .
Of course , Kaa could have crush a dozen Mowglis if he have let himself go ; but he play carefully , and never loose one-tenth of his power .
Ever since Mowgli be strong enough to endure a little rough handling , Kaa have teach him this game , and it supple his limb a nothing else could .
Sometimes Mowgli would stand lap almost to his throat in Kaa 's shifting coil , strive to get one arm free and catch him by the throat .
Then Kaa would give way limply , and Mowgli , with both quick-moving foot , would try to cramp the purchase of that huge tail a it fling backward feel for a rock or a stump .
They would rock to and fro , head to head , each wait for his chance , till the beautiful , statue-like group melt in a whirl of black-and-yellow coil and struggle leg and arm , to rise up again and again .
`` Now !
now !
now ! ''
say Kaa , make feint with his head that even Mowgli 's quick hand could not turn aside .
`` Look !
I touch thee here , Little Brother !
Here , and here !
Are thy hand numb ?
Here again ! ''
The game always end in one way -- with a straight , drive blow of the head that knock the boy over and over .
Mowgli could never learn the guard for that lightning lunge , and , a Kaa say , there be not the least use in try .
`` Good hunting ! ''
Kaa grunt at last ; and Mowgli , a usual , be shoot away half a dozen yard , gasp and laugh .
He rise with his finger full of grass , and follow Kaa to the wise snake 's pet bathing-place -- a deep , pitchy-black pool surround with rock , and make interesting by sunken tree-stumps .
The boy slip in , Jungle-fashion , without a sound , and dive across ; rise , too , without a sound , and turn on his back , his arm behind his head , watch the moon rise above the rock , and break up her reflection in the water with his toe .
Kaa 's diamond-shaped head cut the pool like a razor , and come out to rest on Mowgli 's shoulder .
They lay still , soak luxuriously in the cool water .
`` It be VERY good , '' say Mowgli at last , sleepily .
`` Now , in the Man-Pack , at this hour , a I remember , they lay them down upon hard piece of wood in the inside of a mud-trap , and , have carefully shut out all the clean wind , draw foul cloth over their heavy head and make evil song through their nose .
It be well in the Jungle . ''
A hurrying cobra slip down over a rock and drank , give them `` Good hunting ! ''
and go away .
`` Sssh ! ''
say Kaa , a though he have suddenly remember something .
`` So the Jungle give thee all that thou hast ever desire , Little Brother ? ''
`` Not all , '' say Mowgli , laughing ; `` else there would be a new and strong Shere Khan to kill once a moon .
Now , I could kill with my own hand , ask no help of buffalo .
And also I have wish the sun to shine in the middle of the Rains , and the Rains to cover the sun in the deep of summer ; and also I have never go empty but I wish that I have kill a goat ; and also I have never kill a goat but I wish it have be buck ; nor buck but I wish it have be nilghai .
But thus do we feel , all of u . ''
`` Thou hast no other desire ? ''
the big snake demand .
`` What more can I wish ?
I have the Jungle , and the favour of the Jungle !
Is there more anywhere between sunrise and sunset ? ''
`` Now , the Cobra say -- '' Kaa begin .
`` What cobra ?
He that go away just now say nothing .
He be hunt . ''
`` It be another . ''
`` Hast thou many dealing with the Poison People ?
I give them their own path .
They carry death in the fore-tooth , and that be not good -- for they be so small .
But what hood be this thou hast speak with ? ''
Kaa roll slowly in the water like a steamer in a beam sea .
`` Three or four moon since , '' say he , `` I hunt in Cold Lairs , which place thou hast not forget .
And the thing I hunt flee shriek past the tank and to that house whose side I once break for thy sake , and run into the ground . ''
`` But the people of Cold Lairs do not live in burrow . ''
Mowgli know that Kaa be tell of the Monkey People .
`` This thing be not living , but seek to live , '' Kaa reply , with a quiver of his tongue .
`` He run into a burrow that lead very far .
I follow , and have kill , I sleep .
When I wake I go forward . ''
`` Under the earth ? ''
`` Even so , come at last upon a White Hood -LSB- a white cobra -RSB- , who speak of thing beyond my knowledge , and show me many thing I have never before see . ''
`` New game ?
Was it good hunting ? ''
Mowgli turn quickly on his side .
`` It be no game , and would have break all my teeth ; but the White Hood say that a man -- he speak a one that know the breed -- that a man would give the breath under his rib for only the sight of those thing . ''
`` We will look , '' say Mowgli .
`` I now remember that I be once a man . ''
`` Slowly -- slowly .
It be haste kill the Yellow Snake that eat the sun .
We two speak together under the earth , and I speak of thee , name thee a a man .
Said the White Hood -LRB- and he be indeed as old a the Jungle -RRB- : ` It be long since I have see a man .
Let him come , and he shall see all these thing , for the least of which very many men would die . ' ''
`` That MUST be new game .
And yet the Poison People do not tell u when game be afoot .
They be an unfriendly folk . ''
`` It be NOT game .
It be -- it be -- I can not say what it be . ''
`` We will go there .
I have never see a White Hood , and I wish to see the other thing .
Did he kill them ? ''
`` They be all dead thing .
He say he be the keeper of them all . ''
`` Ah !
As a wolf stand above meat he have take to his own lair .
Let u go . ''
Mowgli swam to bank , roll on the grass to dry himself , and the two set off for Cold Lairs , the deserted city of which you may have heard .
Mowgli be not the least afraid of the Monkey People in those day , but the Monkey People have the lively horror of Mowgli .
Their tribe , however , be raid in the Jungle , and so Cold Lairs stand empty and silent in the moonlight .
Kaa lead up to the ruin of the queen ' pavilion that stand on the terrace , slip over the rubbish , and dive down the half-choked staircase that go underground from the centre of the pavilion .
Mowgli give the snake-call , -- `` We be of one blood , ye and I , '' -- and follow on his hand and knee .
They crawl a long distance down a sloping passage that turn and twist several time , and at last come to where the root of some great tree , grow thirty foot overhead , have force out a solid stone in the wall .
They creep through the gap , and find themselves in a large vault , whose domed roof have be also break away by tree-roots so that a few streak of light drop down into the darkness .
`` A safe lair , '' say Mowgli , rise to his firm foot , `` but over-far to visit daily .
And now what do we see ? ''
`` Am I nothing ? ''
say a voice in the middle of the vault ; and Mowgli saw something white move till , little by little , there stand up the hugest cobra he have ever set eye on -- a creature nearly eight foot long , and bleach by be in darkness to an old ivory-white .
Even the spectacle-marks of his spread hood have fade to faint yellow .
His eye be as red a ruby , and altogether he be most wonderful .
`` Good hunting ! ''
say Mowgli , who carry his manner with his knife , and that never leave him .
`` What of the city ? ''
say the White Cobra , without answer the greeting .
`` What of the great , the walled city -- the city of a hundred elephant and twenty thousand horse , and cattle past counting -- the city of the King of Twenty Kings ?
I grow deaf here , and it be long since I hear their war-gongs . ''
`` The Jungle be above our head , '' say Mowgli .
`` I know only Hathi and his son among elephant .
Bagheera have slay all the horse in one village , and -- what be a King ? ''
`` I tell thee , '' say Kaa softly to the Cobra , -- `` I tell thee , four moon ago , that thy city be not . ''
`` The city -- the great city of the forest whose gate be guard by the King 's tower -- can never pass .
They build it before my father 's father come from the egg , and it shall endure when my son 's son be as white a I !
Salomdhi , son of Chandrabija , son of Viyeja , son of Yegasuri , make it in the day of Bappa Rawal .
Whose cattle be YE ? ''
`` It be a lost trail , '' say Mowgli , turn to Kaa .
`` I know not his talk . ''
`` Nor I .
He be very old .
Father of Cobras , there be only the Jungle here , a it have be since the beginning . ''
`` Then who be HE , '' say the White Cobra , `` sit down before me , unafraid , know not the name of the King , talk our talk through a man 's lip ?
Who be he with the knife and the snake 's tongue ? ''
`` Mowgli they call me , '' be the answer .
`` I be of the Jungle .
The wolf be my people , and Kaa here be my brother .
Father of Cobras , who art thou ? ''
`` I be the Warden of the King 's Treasure .
Kurrun Raja build the stone above me , in the day when my skin be dark , that I might teach death to those who come to steal .
Then they let down the treasure through the stone , and I hear the song of the Brahmins my master . ''
`` Umm ! ''
say Mowgli to himself .
`` I have deal with one Brahmin already , in the Man-Pack , and -- I know what I know .
Evil come here in a little . ''
`` Five time since I come here have the stone be lift , but always to let down more , and never to take away .
There be no rich like these rich -- the treasure of a hundred king .
But it be long and long since the stone be last moved , and I think that my city have forget . ''
`` There be no city .
Look up .
Yonder be root of the great tree tear the stone apart .
Trees and men do not grow together , '' Kaa insist .
`` Twice and thrice have men find their way here , '' the White Cobra answer savagely ; `` but they never speak till I come upon them grope in the dark , and then they cry only a little time .
But ye come with lie , Man and Snake both , and would have me believe the city be not , and that my wardship end .
Little do men change in the year .
But I change never !
Till the stone be lift , and the Brahmins come down sing the song that I know , and fee me with warm milk , and take me to the light again , I -- I -- I , and no other , be the Warden of the King 's Treasure !
The city be dead , ye say , and here be the root of the tree ?
Stoop down , then , and take what ye will .
Earth have no treasure like to these .
Man with the snake 's tongue , if thou canst go alive by the way that thou hast enter it , the less Kings will be thy servant ! ''
`` Again the trail be lose , '' say Mowgli coolly .
`` Can any jackal have burrow so deep and bite this great White Hood ?
He be surely mad .
Father of Cobras , I see nothing here to take away . ''
`` By the Gods of the Sun and Moon , it be the madness of death upon the boy ! ''
hiss the Cobra .
`` Before thine eye close I will allow thee this favour .
Look thou , and see what man have never see before ! ''
`` They do not well in the Jungle who speak to Mowgli of favour , '' say the boy , between his teeth ; `` but the dark change all , a I know .
I will look , if that please thee . ''
He star with puckered-up eye round the vault , and then lift up from the floor a handful of something that glitter .
`` Oho ! ''
say he , `` this be like the stuff they play with in the Man-Pack : only this be yellow and the other be brown . ''
He let the gold piece fall , and move forward .
The floor of the vault be bury some five or six foot deep in coined gold and silver that have burst from the sack it have be originally store in , and , in the long year , the metal have pack and settle a sand pack at low tide .
On it and in it and rise through it , a wreck lift through the sand , be jewel elephant-howdahs of embossed silver , stud with plate of hammered gold , and adorn with carbuncle and turquoise .
There be palanquin and litter for carry queen , frame and brace with silver and enamel , with jade-handled pole and amber curtain-rings ; there be golden candlestick hung with pierced emerald that quiver on the branch ; there be stud image , five foot high , of forgotten god , silver with jewelled eye ; there be coat of mail , gold inlaid on steel , and fringe with rot and blacken seed-pearls ; there be helmet , crest and bead with pigeon 's - blood ruby ; there be shield of lacquer , of tortoise-shell and rhinoceros-hide , strap and boss with red gold and set with emerald at the edge ; there be sheaf of diamond-hilted sword , dagger , and hunting-knives ; there be golden sacrificial bowl and ladle , and portable altar of a shape that never see the light of day ; there be jade cup and bracelet ; there be incense-burners , comb , and pot for perfume , henna , and eye-powder , all in embossed gold ; there be nose-rings , armlet , head-bands , finger-rings , and girdle past any counting ; there be belt , seven finger broad , of square-cut diamond and ruby , and wooden box , trebly clamp with iron , from which the wood have fall away in powder , show the pile of uncut star-sapphires , opal , cat 's - eye , sapphire , ruby , diamond , emerald , and garnet within .
The White Cobra be right .
No mere money would begin to pay the value of this treasure , the sifted picking of century of war , plunder , trade , and taxation .
The coin alone be priceless , leave out of count all the precious stone ; and the dead weight of the gold and silver alone might be two or three hundred ton .
Every native ruler in India to-day , however poor , have a hoard to which he be always add ; and though , once in a long while , some enlighten prince may send off forty or fifty bullock-cart load of silver to be exchange for Government security , the bulk of them keep their treasure and the knowledge of it very closely to themselves .
But Mowgli naturally do not understand what these thing meant .
The knife interest him a little , but they do not balance so well a his own , and so he drop them .
At last he find something really fascinating laid on the front of a howdah half bury in the coin .
It be a three-foot ankus , or elephant-goad -- something like a small boat-hook .
The top be one round , shin ruby , and eight inch of the handle below it be stud with rough turquoise close together , give a most satisfactory grip .
Below them be a rim of jade with a flower-pattern running round it -- only the leaf be emerald , and the blossom be ruby sink in the cool , green stone .
The rest of the handle be a shaft of pure ivory , while the point -- the spike and hook -- be gold-inlaid steel with picture of elephant-catching ; and the picture attract Mowgli , who saw that they have something to do with his friend Hathi the Silent .
The White Cobra have be follow him closely .
`` Is this not worth die to behold ? ''
he say .
`` Have I not do thee a great favour ? ''
`` I do not understand , '' say Mowgli .
`` The thing be hard and cold , and by no mean good to eat .
But this '' -- he lift the ankus -- `` I desire to take away , that I may see it in the sun .
Thou sayest they be all thine ?
Wilt thou give it to me , and I will bring thee frog to eat ? ''
The White Cobra fairly shake with evil delight .
`` Assuredly I will give it , '' he say .
`` All that be here I will give thee -- till thou go away . ''
`` But I go now .
This place be dark and cold , and I wish to take the thorn-pointed thing to the Jungle . ''
`` Look by thy foot !
What be that there ? ''
Mowgli pick up something white and smooth .
`` It be the bone of a man 's head , '' he say quietly .
`` And here be two more . ''
`` They come to take the treasure away many year ago .
I speak to them in the dark , and they lay still . ''
`` But what do I need of this that be call treasure ?
If thou wilt give me the ankus to take away , it be good hunting .
If not , it be good hunt none the less .
I do not fight with the Poison People , and I be also teach the Master-word of thy tribe . ''
`` There be but one Master-word here .
It be mine ! ''
Kaa fling himself forward with blaze eye .
`` Who bid me bring the Man ? ''
he hiss .
`` I surely , '' the old Cobra lisp .
`` It be long since I have see Man , and this Man speak our tongue . ''
`` But there be no talk of killing .
How can I go to the Jungle and say that I have lead him to his death ? ''
say Kaa .
`` I talk not of kill till the time .
And a to thy go or not go , there be the hole in the wall .
Peace , now , thou fat monkey-killer !
I have but to touch thy neck , and the Jungle will know thee no longer .
Never Man come here that go away with the breath under his rib .
I be the Warden of the Treasure of the King 's City ! ''
`` But , thou white worm of the dark , I tell thee there be neither king nor city !
The Jungle be all about u ! ''
cry Kaa .
`` There be still the Treasure .
But this can be do .
Wait awhile , Kaa of the Rocks , and see the boy run .
There be room for great sport here .
Life be good .
Run to and fro awhile , and make sport , boy ! ''
Mowgli put his hand on Kaa 's head quietly .
`` The white thing have deal with men of the Man-Pack until now .
He do not know me , '' he whisper .
`` He have ask for this hunting .
Let him have it . ''
Mowgli have be stand with the ankus hold point down .
He fling it from him quickly and it drop crossway just behind the great snake 's hood , pin him to the floor .
In a flash , Kaa 's weight be upon the writhing body , paralyse it from hood to tail .
The red eye burn , and the six spare inch of the head strike furiously right and leave .
`` Kill ! ''
say Kaa , a Mowgli 's hand go to his knife .
`` No , '' he say , a he draw the blade ; `` I will never kill again save for food .
But look you , Kaa ! ''
He catch the snake behind the hood , force the mouth open with the blade of the knife , and show the terrible poison-fangs of the upper jaw lie black and wither in the gum .
The White Cobra have outlive his poison , a a snake will .
`` THUU '' -LRB- `` It be dry up '' -- Literally , a rot out tree-stump -RRB- , say Mowgli ; and motion Kaa away , he pick up the ankus , set the White Cobra free .
`` The King 's Treasure need a new Warden , '' he say gravely .
`` Thuu , thou hast not do well .
Run to and fro and make sport , Thuu ! ''
`` I be ashamed .
Kill me ! ''
hiss the White Cobra .
`` There have be too much talk of killing .
We will go now .
I take the thorn-pointed thing , Thuu , because I have fight and worst thee . ''
`` See , then , that the thing do not kill thee at last .
It be Death !
Remember , it be Death !
There be enough in that thing to kill the men of all my city .
Not long wilt thou hold it , Jungle Man , nor he who take it from thee .
They will kill , and kill , and kill for it sake !
My strength be dry up , but the ankus will do my work .
It be Death !
It be Death !
It be Death ! ''
Mowgli crawl out through the hole into the passage again , and the last that he saw be the White Cobra strike furiously with his harmless fang at the stolid golden face of the god that lay on the floor , and hissing , `` It be Death ! ''
They be glad to get to the light of day once more ; and when they be back in their own Jungle and Mowgli make the ankus glitter in the morning light , he be almost as pleased a though he have find a bunch of new flower to stick in his hair .
`` This be bright than Bagheera 's eye , '' he say delightedly , a he twirl the ruby .
`` I will show it to him ; but what do the Thuu mean when he talk of death ? ''
`` I can not say .
I be sorrowful to my tail 's tail that he felt not thy knife .
There be always evil at Cold Lairs -- above ground or below .
But now I be hungry .
Dost thou hunt with me this dawn ? ''
say Kaa .
`` No ; Bagheera must see this thing .
Good hunting ! ''
Mowgli dance off , flourish the great ankus , and stop from time to time to admire it , till he come to that part of the Jungle Bagheera chiefly use , and find him drinking after a heavy kill .
Mowgli tell him all his adventure from begin to end , and Bagheera sniff at the ankus between while .
When Mowgli come to the White Cobra 's last word , the Panther purr approvingly .
`` Then the White Hood speak the thing which be ? ''
Mowgli ask quickly .
`` I be bear in the King 's cage at Oodeypore , and it be in my stomach that I know some little of Man .
Very many men would kill thrice in a night for the sake of that one big red stone alone . ''
`` But the stone make it heavy to the hand .
My little bright knife be well ; and -- see !
the red stone be not good to eat .
Then WHY would they kill ? ''
`` Mowgli , go thou and sleep .
Thou hast live among men , and -- '' `` I remember .
Men kill because they be not hunt ; -- for idleness and pleasure .
Wake again , Bagheera .
For what use be this thorn-pointed thing make ? ''
Bagheera half open his eye -- he be very sleepy -- with a malicious twinkle .
`` It be make by men to thrust into the head of the son of Hathi , so that the blood should pour out .
I have see the like in the street of Oodeypore , before our cage .
That thing have taste the blood of many such a Hathi . ''
`` But why do they thrust into the head of elephant ? ''
`` To teach them Man 's Law .
Having neither claw nor teeth , men make these thing -- and bad . ''
`` Always more blood when I come near , even to the thing the Man-Pack have make , '' say Mowgli disgustedly .
He be get a little tired of the weight of the ankus .
`` If I have know this , I would not have take it .
First it be Messua 's blood on the thong , and now it be Hathi 's .
I will use it no more .
Look ! ''
The ankus fly sparkling , and bury itself point down thirty yard away , between the tree .
`` So my hand be clean of Death , '' say Mowgli , rub his palm on the fresh , moist earth .
`` The Thuu say Death would follow me .
He be old and white and mad . ''
`` White or black , or death or life , I be go to sleep , Little Brother .
I can not hunt all night and howl all day , a do some folk . ''
Bagheera go off to a hunting-lair that he know , about two mile off .
Mowgli make an easy way for himself up a convenient tree , knot three or four creeper together , and in less time than it take to tell be swing in a hammock fifty foot above ground .
Though he have no positive objection to strong daylight , Mowgli follow the custom of his friend , and use it as little a he could .
When he wake among the very loud-voiced people that live in the tree , it be twilight once more , and he have be dream of the beautiful pebble he have throw away .
`` At least I will look at the thing again , '' he say , and slide down a creeper to the earth ; but Bagheera be before him .
Mowgli could hear him snuff in the half light .
`` Where be the thorn-pointed thing ? ''
cry Mowgli .
`` A man have take it .
Here be the trail . ''
`` Now we shall see whether the Thuu speak truth .
If the pointed thing be Death , that man will die .
Let u follow . ''
`` Kill first , '' say Bagheera .
`` An empty stomach make a careless eye .
Men go very slowly , and the Jungle be wet enough to hold the light mark . ''
They kill as soon a they could , but it be nearly three hour before they finish their meat and drink and buckle down to the trail .
The Jungle People know that nothing make up for be hurry over your meal .
`` Think you the pointed thing will turn in the man 's hand and kill him ? ''
Mowgli ask .
`` The Thuu say it be Death . ''
`` We shall see when we find , '' say Bagheera , trot with his head low .
`` It be single-foot '' -LRB- he mean that there be only one man -RRB- , `` and the weight of the thing have press his heel far into the ground . ''
`` Hai !
This be as clear a summer lightning , '' Mowgli answer ; and they fell into the quick , choppy trail-trot in and out through the checker of the moonlight , follow the mark of those two bare foot .
`` Now he run swiftly , '' say Mowgli .
`` The toe be spread apart . ''
They go on over some wet ground .
`` Now why do he turn aside here ? ''
`` Wait ! ''
say Bagheera , and fling himself forward with one superb bound as far a ever he could .
The first thing to do when a trail cease to explain itself be to cast forward without leave , your own confusing foot-marks on the ground .
Bagheera turn a he land , and face Mowgli , cry , `` Here come another trail to meet him .
It be a small foot , this second trail , and the toe turn inward . ''
Then Mowgli run up and look .
`` It be the foot of a Gond hunter , '' he say .
`` Look !
Here he drag his bow on the grass .
That be why the first trail turn aside so quickly .
Big Foot hid from Little Foot . ''
`` That be true , '' say Bagheera .
`` Now , l by cross each other 's track we foul the sign , let each take one trail .
I be Big Foot , Little Brother , and thou art Little Foot , the Gond . ''
Bagheera leap back to the original trail , leave Mowgli stoop above the curious narrow track of the wild little man of the wood .
`` Now , '' say Bagheera , move step by step along the chain of footprint , `` I , Big Foot , turn aside here .
Now I hide me behind a rock and stand still , not dare to shift my foot .
Cry thy trail , Little Brother . ''
`` Now , I , Little Foot , come to the rock , '' say Mowgli , run up his trail .
`` Now , I sit down under the rock , lean upon my right hand , and rest my bow between my toe .
I wait long , for the mark of my foot be deep here . ''
`` I also , '' say Bagheera , hide behind the rock .
`` I wait , rest the end of the thorn-pointed thing upon a stone .
It slip , for here be a scratch upon the stone .
Cry thy trail , Little Brother . ''
`` One , two twig and a big branch be break here , '' say Mowgli , in an undertone .
`` Now , how shall I cry THAT ?
Ah !
It be plain now .
I , Little Foot , go away make noise and trampling so that Big Foot may hear me . ''
He move away from the rock pace by pace among the tree , his voice rise in the distance a he approach a little cascade .
`` I -- go , far -- away -- to -- where -- the -- noise -- of -- falling-water -- cover -- my -- noise ; and -- here -- I -- wait .
Cry thy trail , Bagheera , Big Foot ! ''
The panther have be cast in every direction to see how Big Foot 's trail lead away from behind the rock .
Then he give tongue : `` I come from behind the rock upon my knee , drag the thorn-pointed thing .
Seeing no one , I run .
I , Big Foot , run swiftly .
The trail be clear .
Let each follow his own .
I run ! ''
Bagheera sweep on along the clearly-marked trail , and Mowgli follow the step of the Gond .
For some time there be silence in the Jungle .
`` Where art thou , Little Foot ? ''
cry Bagheera .
Mowgli 's voice answer him not fifty yard to the right .
`` Um ! ''
say the Panther , with a deep cough .
`` The two run side by side , draw nearer ! ''
They race on another half-mile , always keep about the same distance , till Mowgli , whose head be not so close to the ground a Bagheera 's , cry : `` They have meet .
Good hunting -- look !
Here stand Little Foot , with his knee on a rock -- and yonder be Big Foot indeed ! ''
Not ten yard in front of them , stretch across a pile of broken rock , lay the body of a villager of the district , a long , small-feathered Gond arrow through his back and breast .
`` Was the Thuu so old and so mad , Little Brother ? ''
say Bagheera gently .
`` Here be one death , at least . ''
`` Follow on .
But where be the drinker of elephant 's blood -- the red-eyed thorn ? ''
`` Little Foot have it -- perhaps .
It be single-foot again now . ''
The single trail of a light man who have be run quickly and bear a burden on his left shoulder hold on round a long , low spur of dried grass , where each footfall seem , to the sharp eye of the tracker , mark in hot iron .
Neither spoke till the trail run up to the ash of a camp-fire hidden in a ravine .
`` Again ! ''
say Bagheera , check a though he have be turn into stone .
The body of a little wizened Gond lay with it foot in the ash , and Bagheera look inquiringly at Mowgli .
`` That be do with a bamboo , '' say the boy , after one glance .
`` I have use such a thing among the buffalo when I serve in the Man-Pack .
The Father of Cobras -- I be sorrowful that I make a jest of him -- know the breed well , a I might have know .
Said I not that men kill for idleness ? ''
`` Indeed , they kill for the sake of the red and blue stone , '' Bagheera answer .
`` Remember , I be in the King 's cage at Oodeypore . ''
`` One , two , three , four track , '' say Mowgli , stoop over the ash .
`` Four track of men with shod foot .
They do not go so quickly a Gonds .
Now , what evil have the little woodman do to them ?
See , they talk together , all five , stand up , before they kill him .
Bagheera , let u go back .
My stomach be heavy in me , and yet it heave up and down like an oriole 's nest at the end of a branch . ''
`` It be not good hunting to leave game afoot .
Follow ! ''
say the panther .
`` Those eight shoe foot have not go far . ''
No more be say for fully an hour , a they work up the broad trail of the four men with shod foot .
It be clear , hot daylight now , and Bagheera say , `` I smell smoke . ''
Men be always more ready to eat than to run , Mowgli answer , trot in and out between the low scrub bush of the new Jungle they be explore .
Bagheera , a little to his left , make an indescribable noise in his throat .
`` Here be one that have do with feeding , '' say he .
A tumbled bundle of gay-coloured clothes lay under a bush , and round it be some spilt flour .
`` That be do by the bamboo again , '' say Mowgli .
`` See !
that white dust be what men eat .
They have take the kill from this one , -- he carry their food , -- and give him for a kill to Chil , the Kite . ''
`` It be the third , '' say Bagheera .
`` I will go with new , big frog to the Father of Cobras , and fee him fat , '' say Mowgli to himself .
`` The drinker of elephant 's blood be Death himself -- but still I do not understand ! ''
`` Follow ! ''
say Bagheera .
They have not go half a mile farther when they hear Ko , the Crow , sing the death-song in the top of a tamarisk under whose shade three men be lie .
A half-dead fire smoke in the centre of the circle , under an iron plate which hold a blacken and burn cake of unleavened bread .
Close to the fire , and blaze in the sunshine , lay the ruby-and-turquoise ankus .
`` The thing work quickly ; all end here , '' say Bagheera .
`` How do THESE die , Mowgli ?
There be no mark on any . ''
A Jungle-dweller get to learn by experience as much a many doctor know of poisonous plant and berry .
Mowgli sniff the smoke that come up from the fire , break off a morsel of the blacken bread , taste it , and spat it out again .
`` Apple of Death , '' he cough .
`` The first must have make it ready in the food for THESE , who kill him , have first kill the Gond . ''
`` Good hunting , indeed !
The kill follow close , '' say Bagheera .
`` Apple of Death '' be what the Jungle call thorn-apple or dhatura , the ready poison in all India .
`` What now ? ''
say the panther .
`` Must thou and I kill each other for yonder red-eyed slayer ? ''
`` Can it speak ? ''
say Mowgli in a whisper .
`` Did I do it a wrong when I throw it away ?
Between u two it can do no wrong , for we do not desire what men desire .
If it be leave here , it will assuredly continue to kill men one after another as fast a nut fall in a high wind .
I have no love to men , but even I would not have them die six in a night . ''
`` What matter ?
They be only men .
They kill one another , and be well pleased , '' say Bagheera .
`` That first little woodman hunt well . ''
`` They be cub none the le ; and a cub will drown himself to bite the moon 's light on the water .
The fault be mine , '' say Mowgli , who speak a though he know all about everything .
`` I will never again bring into the Jungle strange thing -- not though they be as beautiful a flower .
This '' -- he handle the ankus gingerly -- `` go back to the Father of Cobras .
But first we must sleep , and we can not sleep near these sleeper .
Also we must bury HIM , l he run away and kill another six .
Dig me a hole under that tree . ''
`` But , Little Brother , '' say Bagheera , move off to the spot , `` I tell thee it be no fault of the blood-drinker .
The trouble be with the men . ''
`` All one , '' say Mowgli .
`` Dig the hole deep .
When we wake I will take him up and carry him back . ''
***** Two night later , a the White Cobra sit mourn in the darkness of the vault , ashamed , and rob , and alone , the turquoise ankus whirl through the hole in the wall , and clash on the floor of golden coin .
`` Father of Cobras , '' say Mowgli -LRB- he be careful to keep the other side of the wall -RRB- , `` get thee a young and ripe one of thine own people to help thee guard the King 's Treasure , so that no man may come away alive any more . ''
`` Ah-ha !
It return , then .
I say the thing be Death .
How come it that thou art still alive ? ''
the old Cobra mumble , twin lovingly round the ankus-haft .
`` By the Bull that buy me , I do not know !
That thing have kill six time in a night .
Let him go out no more . ''
THE SONG OF THE LITTLE HUNTER Ere Mor the Peacock flutter , ere the Monkey People cry , Ere Chil the Kite swoop down a furlong sheer , Through the Jungle very softly flit a shadow and a sigh -- He be Fear , O Little Hunter , he be Fear !
Very softly down the glade run a waiting , watch shade , And the whisper spread and widen far and near ; And the sweat be on thy brow , for he pass even now -- He be Fear , O Little Hunter , he be Fear !
Ere the moon have climb the mountain , ere the rock be rib with light , When the downward-dipping trail be dank and drear , Comes a breathe hard behind thee -- snuffle-snuffle through the night -- It be Fear , O Little Hunter , it be Fear !
On thy knee and draw the bow ; bid the shrilling arrow go ; In the empty , mock thicket plunge the spear ; But thy hand be loose and weak , and the blood have leave thy cheek -- It be Fear , O Little Hunter , it be Fear !
When the heat-cloud suck the tempest , when the sliver pine-trees fall , When the blinding , blare rain-squalls lash and veer ; Through the war-gongs of the thunder ring a voice more loud than all -- It be Fear , O Little Hunter , it be Fear !
Now the spate be bank and deep ; now the footless boulder leap -- Now the lightning show each little leaf-rib clear -- But thy throat be shut and dry , and thy heart against thy side Hammers : Fear , O Little Hunter -- this be Fear !
QUIQUERN The People of the Eastern Ice , they be melt like the snow -- They beg for coffee and sugar ; they go where the white men go .
The People of the Western Ice , they learn to steal and fight ; `` They sell their fur to the trading-post : they sell their soul to the white .
The People of the Southern Ice , they trade with the whaler 's crew ; Their woman have many ribbon , but their tent be torn and few .
But the People of the Elder Ice , beyond the white man 's ken -- Their spear be make of the narwhal-horn , and they be the last of the Men !
Translation .
`` He have open his eye .
Look ! ''
`` Put him in the skin again .
He will be a strong dog .
On the fourth month we will name him . ''
`` For whom ? ''
say Amoraq .
Kadlu 's eye roll round the skin-lined snow-house till it fell on fourteen-year-old Kotuko sit on the sleeping-bench , make a button out of walrus ivory .
`` Name him for me , '' say Kotuko , with a grin .
`` I shall need him one day . ''
Kadlu grin back till his eye be almost bury in the fat of his flat cheek , and nod to Amoraq , while the puppy 's fierce mother whine to see her baby wriggle far out of reach in the little sealskin pouch hung above the warmth of the blubber-lamp .
Kotuko go on with his carving , and Kadlu throw a rolled bundle of leather dog-harnesses into a tiny little room that open from one side of the house , slip off his heavy deerskin hunting-suit , put it into a whalebone-net that hung above another lamp , and drop down on the sleeping-bench to whittle at a piece of frozen seal-meat till Amoraq , his wife , should bring the regular dinner of boiled meat and blood-soup .
He have be out since early dawn at the seal-holes , eight mile away , and have come home with three big seal .
Half-way down the long , low snow passage or tunnel that lead to the inner door of the house you could hear snappings and yelping , a the dog of his sleigh-team , release from the day 's work , scuffle for warm place .
When the yelping grow too loud Kotuko lazily roll off the sleeping-bench , and pick up a whip with an eighteen-inch handle of springy whalebone , and twenty-five foot of heavy , plaited thong .
He dive into the passage , where it sound a though all the dog be eat him alive ; but that be no more than their regular grace before meal .
When he crawl out at the far end , half a dozen furry head follow him with their eye a he go to a sort of gallows of whale-jawbones , from which the dog 's meat be hang ; split off the frozen stuff in big lump with a broad-headed spear ; and stand , his whip in one hand and the meat in the other .
Each beast be call by name , the weak first , and woe betide any dog that move out of his turn ; for the tapering lash would shoot out like thonged lightning , and flick away an inch or so of hair and hide .
Each beast growl , snap , choke once over his portion , and hurry back to the protection of the passage , while the boy stand upon the snow under the blazing Northern Lights and deal out justice .
The last to be serve be the big black leader of the team , who keep order when the dog be harness ; and to him Kotuko give a double allowance of meat as well a an extra crack of the whip .
`` Ah ! ''
say Kotuko , coil up the lash , `` I have a little one over the lamp that will make a great many howling .
SARPOK !
Get in ! ''
He crawl back over the huddled dog , dust the dry snow from his fur with the whalebone beater that Amoraq keep by the door , tap the skin-lined roof of the house to shake off any icicle that might have fall from the dome of snow above , and curl up on the bench .
The dog in the passage snore and whine in their sleep , the boy-baby in Amoraq 's deep fur hood kick and choke and gurgle , and the mother of the newly-named puppy lay at Kotuko 's side , her eye fix on the bundle of sealskin , warm and safe above the broad yellow flame of the lamp .
And all this happen far away to the north , beyond Labrador , beyond Hudson 's Strait , where the great tide heave the ice about , north of Melville Peninsula -- north even of the narrow Fury and Hecla Straits -- on the north shore of Baffin Land , where Bylot 's Island stand above the ice of Lancaster Sound like a pudding-bowl wrong side up .
North of Lancaster Sound there be little we know anything about , except North Devon and Ellesmere Land ; but even there live a few scattered people , next door , a it be , to the very Pole .
Kadlu be an Inuit , -- what you call an Esquimau , -- and his tribe , some thirty person all tell , belong to the Tununirmiut -- `` the country lie at the back of something . ''
In the map that desolate coast be write Navy Board Inlet , but the Inuit name be best , because the country lie at the very back of everything in the world .
For nine month of the year there be only ice and snow , and gale after gale , with a cold that no one can realise who have never see the thermometer even at zero .
For six month of those nine it be dark ; and that be what make it so horrible .
In the three month of the summer it only freeze every other day and every night , and then the snow begin to weep off on the southerly slope , and a few ground-willows put out their woolly bud , a tiny stonecrop or so make believe to blossom , beach of fine gravel and round stone run down to the open sea , and polish boulder and streak rock lift up above the granulate snow .
But all that be go in a few week , and the wild winter lock down again on the land ; while at sea the ice tear up and down the offing , jamming and ramming , and splitting and hitting , and pounding and grounding , till it all freeze together , ten foot thick , from the land outward to deep water .
In the winter Kadlu would follow the seal to the edge of this land-ice , and spear them a they come up to breathe at their blow-holes .
The seal must have open water to live and catch fish in , and in the deep of winter the ice would sometimes run eighty mile without a break from the near shore .
In the spring he and his people retreat from the floe to the rocky mainland , where they put up tent of skin , and snare the sea-birds , or spear the young seal bask on the beach .
Later , they would go south into Baffin Land after the reindeer , and to get their year 's store of salmon from the hundred of stream and lake of the interior ; come back north in September or October for the musk-ox hunting and the regular winter sealery .
This travelling be do with dog-sleighs , twenty and thirty mile a day , or sometimes down the coast in big skin `` woman-boats , '' when the dog and the baby lay among the foot of the rower , and the woman sing song a they glide from cape to cape over the glassy , cold water .
All the luxury that the Tununirmiut know come from the south -- driftwood for sleigh-runners , rod-iron for harpoon-tips , steel knife , tin kettle that cook food much well than the old soap-stone affair , flint and steel , and even match , as well a colour ribbon for the woman 's hair , little cheap mirror , and red cloth for the edging of deerskin dress-jackets .
Kadlu trade the rich , creamy , twisted narwhal horn and musk-ox teeth -LRB- these be just as valuable a pearls -RRB- to the Southern Inuit , and they , in turn , trade with the whaler and the missionary-posts of Exeter and Cumberland Sounds ; and so the chain go on , till a kettle pick up by a ship 's cook in the Bhendy Bazaar might end it day over a blubber-lamp somewhere on the cool side of the Arctic Circle .
Kadlu , be a good hunter , be rich in iron harpoon , snow-knives , bird-darts , and all the other thing that make life easy up there in the great cold ; and he be the head of his tribe , or , a they say , `` the man who know all about it by practice . ''
This do not give him any authority , except now and then he could advise his friend to change their hunting-grounds ; but Kotuko use it to domineer a little , in the lazy , fat Inuit fashion , over the other boy , when they come out at night to play ball in the moonlight , or to sing the Child 's Song to the Aurora Borealis .
But at fourteen an Inuit feel himself a man , and Kotuko be tire of make snare for wild-fowl and kit-foxes , and most tire of all of help the woman to chew seal-and deer-skins -LRB- that supple them a nothing else can -RRB- the long day through , while the men be out hunting .
He want to go into the quaggi , the Singing-House , when the hunter gather there for their mystery , and the angekok , the sorcerer , frighten them into the most delightful fit after the lamp be put out , and you could hear the Spirit of the Reindeer stamping on the roof ; and when a spear be thrust out into the open black night it come back cover with hot blood .
He want to throw his big boot into the net with the tired air of the head of a family , and to gamble with the hunter when they drop in of an evening and play a sort of home-made roulette with a tin pot and a nail .
There be hundred of thing that he want to do , but the grown men laugh at him and say , `` Wait till you have be in the buckle , Kotuko .
Hunting be not ALL catching . ''
Now that his father have name a puppy for him , thing look brighter .
An Inuit do not waste a good dog on his son till the boy know something of dog-driving ; and Kotuko be more than sure that he know more than everything .
If the puppy have not have an iron constitution he would have die from over-stuffing and over-handling .
Kotuko make him a tiny harness with a trace to it , and haul him all over the house-floor , shouting : `` Aua !
Ja aua ! ''
-LRB- Go to the right -RRB- .
`` Choiachoi !
Ja choiachoi ! ''
-LRB- Go to the left -RRB- .
`` Ohaha ! ''
-LRB- Stop -RRB- .
The puppy do not like it at all , but be fish for in this way be pure happiness beside be put to the sleigh for the first time .
He just sit down on the snow , and play with the seal-hide trace that run from his harness to the pitu , the big thong in the bow of the sleigh .
Then the team start , and the puppy find the heavy ten-foot sleigh run up his back , and drag him along the snow , while Kotuko laugh till the tear run down his face .
There follow day and day of the cruel whip that hiss like the wind over ice , and his companion all bite him because he do not know his work , and the harness chafe him , and he be dot allow to sleep with Kotuko any more , but have to take the cold place in the passage .
It be a sad time for the puppy .
The boy learn , too , a fast a the dog ; though a dog-sleigh be a heart-breaking thing to manage .
Each beast be harness , the weak nearest to the driver , by his own separate trace , which run under his left fore-leg to the main thong , where it be fasten by a sort of button and loop which can be slip by a turn of the wrist , thus free one dog at a time .
This be very necessary , because young dog often get the trace between their hind leg , where it cut to the bone .
And they one and all WILL go visit their friend a they run , jump in and out among the trace .
Then they fight , and the result be more mixed than a wet fishing-line next morning .
A great deal of trouble can be avoid by scientific use of the whip .
Every Inuit boy pride himself a be a master of the long lash ; but it be easy to flick at a mark on the ground , and difficult to lean forward and catch a shirking dog just behind the shoulder when the sleigh be go at full speed .
If you call one dog 's name for `` visiting , '' and accidentally lash another , the two will fight it out at once , and stop all the others .
Again , if you travel with a companion and begin to talk , or by yourself and sing , the dog will halt , turn round , and sit down to hear what you have to say .
Kotuko be run away from once or twice through forget to block the sleigh when he stop ; and he break many lashing , and ruin a few thong before he could be trust with a full team of eight and the light sleigh .
Then he felt himself a person of consequence , and on smooth , black ice , with a bold heart and a quick elbow , he smoke along over the level a fast a a pack in full cry .
He would go ten mile to the seal-holes , and when he be on the hunting-grounds he would twitch a trace loose from the pitu , and free the big black leader , who be the clever dog in the team .
As soon a the dog have scent a breathing-hole , Kotuko would reverse the sleigh , drive a couple of sawed-off antler , that stick up like perambulator-handles from the back-rest , deep into the snow , so that the team could not get away .
Then he would crawl forward inch by inch , and wait till the seal come up to breathe .
Then he would stab down swiftly with his spear and running-line , and presently would haul his seal up to the lip of the ice , while the black leader come up and help to pull the carcass across the ice to the sleigh .
That be the time when the harnessed dog yell and foam with excitement , and Kotuko lay the long lash like a red-hot bar across all their face , till the carcass froze stiff .
Going home be the heavy work .
The loaded sleigh have to be humour among the rough ice , and the dog sit down and look hungrily at the seal instead of pull .
At last they would strike the well-worn sleigh-road to the village , and toodle-kiyi along the ringing ice , head down and tail up , while Kotuko strike up the `` An-gutivaun tai-na tau-na-ne taina '' -LRB- The Song of the Returning Hunter -RRB- , and voice hail him from house to house under all that dim , star-littern sky .
When Kotuko the dog come to his full growth he enjoy himself too .
He fight his way up the team steadily , fight after fight , till one fine evening , over their food , he tackle the big , black leader -LRB- Kotuko the boy saw fair play -RRB- , and make second dog of him , a they say .
So he be promote to the long thong of the lead dog , run five foot in advance of all the others : it be his bounden duty to stop all fighting , in harness or out of it , and he wear a collar of copper wire , very thick and heavy .
On special occasion he be feed with cook food inside the house , and sometimes be allow to sleep on the bench with Kotuko .
He be a good seal-dog , and would keep a musk-ox at bay by run round him and snap at his heel .
He would even -- and this for a sleigh-dog be the last proof of bravery -- he would even stand up to the gaunt Arctic wolf , whom all dog of the North , a a rule , fear beyond anything that walk the snow .
He and his master -- they do not count the team of ordinary dog a company -- hunt together , day after day and night after night , fur-wrapped boy and savage , long-haired , narrow-eyed , white-fanged , yellow brute .
All an Inuit have to do be to get food and skin for himself and his family .
The women-folk make the skin into clothing , and occasionally help in trap small game ; but the bulk of the food -- and they eat enormously -- must be find by the men .
If the supply fail there be no one up there to buy or beg or borrow from .
The people must die .
An Inuit do not think of these chance till he be force to .
Kadlu , Kotuko , Amoraq , and the boy-baby who kick about in Amoraq 's fur hood and chew piece of blubber all day , be a happy together a any family in the world .
They come of a very gentle race -- an Inuit seldom lose his temper , and almost never strike a child -- who do not know exactly what tell a real lie meant , still less how to steal .
They be content to spear their live out of the heart of the bitter , hopeless cold ; to smile oily smile , and tell queer ghost and fairy tale of evening , and eat till they could eat no more , and sing the endless woman 's song : `` Amna aya , aya amna , ah !
ah ! ''
through the long lamp-lighted day a they mend their clothes and their hunting-gear .
But one terrible winter everything betray them .
The Tununirmiut return from the yearly salmon-fishing , and make their house on the early ice to the north of Bylot 's Island , ready to go after the seal as soon a the sea froze .
But it be an early and savage autumn .
All through September there be continuous gale that break up the smooth seal-ice when it be only four or five foot thick , and force it inland , and pile a great barrier , some twenty mile broad , of lump and rag and needly ice , over which it be impossible to draw the dog-sleighs .
The edge of the floe off which the seal be use to fish in winter lay perhaps twenty mile beyond this barrier , and out of reach of the Tununirmiut .
Even so , they might have manage to scrape through the winter on their stock of frozen salmon and stored blubber , and what the trap give them , but in December one of their hunter come across a tupik -LRB- a skin-tent -RRB- of three woman and a girl nearly dead , whose men have come down from the far North and be crush in their little skin hunting-boats while they be out after the long-horned narwhal .
Kadlu , of course , could only distribute the woman among the hut of the winter village , for no Inuit dare refuse a meal to a stranger .
He never know when his own turn may come to beg .
Amoraq take the girl , who be about fourteen , into her own house a a sort of servant .
From the cut of her sharp-pointed hood , and the long diamond pattern of her white deer-skin legging , they suppose she come from Ellesmere Land .
She have never see tin cooking-pots or wooden-shod sleigh before ; but Kotuko the boy and Kotuko the dog be rather fond of her .
Then all the fox go south , and even the wolverine , that growl , blunt-headed little thief of the snow , do not take the trouble to follow the line of empty trap that Kotuko set .
The tribe lose a couple of their best hunter , who be badly cripple in a fight with a musk-ox , and this throw more work on the others .
Kotuko go out , day after day , with a light hunting-sleigh and six or seven of the strong dog , look till his eye ache for some patch of clear ice where a seal might perhaps have scratch a breathing-hole .
Kotuko the dog range far and wide , and in the dead stillness of the ice-fields Kotuko the boy could hear his half-choked whine of excitement , above a seal-hole three mile away , as plainly a though he be at his elbow .
When the dog find a hole the boy would build himself a little , low snow wall to keep off the bad of the bitter wind , and there he would wait ten , twelve , twenty hour for the seal to come up to breathe , his eye glue to the tiny mark he have make above the hole to guide the downward thrust of his harpoon , a little seal-skin mat under his foot , and his leg tie together in the tutareang -LRB- the buckle that the old hunter have talk about -RRB- .
This help to keep a man 's leg from twitch a he wait and wait and wait for the quick-eared seal to rise .
Though there be no excitement in it , you can easily believe that the sit still in the buckle with the thermometer perhaps forty degree below zero be the hard work an Inuit know .
When a seal be catch , Kotuko the dog would bind forward , his trace trail behind him , and help to pull the body to the sleigh , where the tired and hungry dog lay sullenly under the lee of the broken ice .
A seal do not go very far , for each mouth in the little village have a right to be fill , and neither bone , hide , nor sinew be waste .
The dog ' meat be take for human use , and Amoraq feed the team with piece of old summer skin-tents rake out from under the sleeping-bench , and they howl and howl again , and wake to howl hungrily .
One could tell by the soap-stone lamp in the hut that famine be near .
In good season , when blubber be plentiful , the light in the boat-shaped lamp would be two foot high -- cheerful , oily , and yellow .
Now it be a bare six inch : Amoraq carefully prick down the moss wick , when an unwatched flame brighten for a moment , and the eye of all the family follow her hand .
The horror of famine up there in the great cold be not so much dying , a die in the dark .
All the Inuit dread the dark that press on them without a break for six month in each year ; and when the lamp be low in the house the mind of people begin to be shake and confuse .
But bad be to come .
The underfed dog snap and growl in the passage , glare at the cold star , and snuff into the bitter wind , night after night .
When they stop howl the silence fell down again a solid and heavy a a snowdrift against a door , and men could hear the beating of their blood in the thin passage of the ear , and the thumping of their own heart , that sound as loud a the noise of sorcerer ' drum beat across the snow .
One night Kotuko the dog , who have be unusually sullen in harness , leap up and push his head against Kotuko 's knee .
Kotuko pat him , but the dog still push blindly forward , fawn .
Then Kadlu wake , and grip the heavy wolf-like head , and star into the glassy eye .
The dog whimper and shiver between Kadlu 's knee .
The hair rise about his neck , and he growl a though a stranger be at the door ; then he bark joyously , and roll on the ground , and bit at Kotuko 's boot like a puppy .
`` What be it ? ''
say Kotuko ; for he be begin to be afraid .
`` The sickness , '' Kadlu answer .
`` It be the dog sickness . ''
Kotuko the dog lift his nose and howl and howl again .
`` I have not see this before .
What will he do ? ''
say Kotuko .
Kadlu shrug one shoulder a little , and cross the hut for his short stabbing-harpoon .
The big dog look at him , howl again , and slink away down the passage , while the other dog draw aside right and leave to give him ample room .
When he be out on the snow he bark furiously , a though on the trail of a musk-ox , and , bark and leap and frisking , pass out of sight .
His trouble be not hydrophobia , but simple , plain madness .
The cold and the hunger , and , above all , the dark , have turn his head ; and when the terrible dog-sickness once show itself in a team , it spread like wild-fire .
Next hunting-day another dog sicken , and be kill then and there by Kotuko a he bite and struggle among the trace .
Then the black second dog , who have be the leader in the old day , suddenly give tongue on an imaginary reindeer-track , and when they slip him from the pitu he fly at the throat of an ice-cliff , and run away a his leader have do , his harness on his back .
After that no one would take the dog out again .
They need them for something else , and the dog know it ; and though they be tie down and feed by hand , their eye be full of despair and fear .
To make thing bad , the old woman begin to tell ghost-tales , and to say that they have meet the spirit of the dead hunter lose that autumn , who prophesy all sort of horrible thing .
Kotuko grieve more for the loss of his dog than anything else ; for though an Inuit eat enormously he also know how to starve .
But the hunger , the darkness , the cold , and the exposure tell on his strength , and he begin to hear voice inside his head , and to see people who be not there , out of the tail of his eye .
One night -- he have unbuckle himself after ten hour ' wait above a `` blind '' seal-hole , and be stagger back to the village faint and dizzy -- he halt to lean his back against a boulder which happen to be support like a rocking-stone on a single jutting point of ice .
His weight disturb the balance of the thing , it roll over ponderously , and a Kotuko spring aside to avoid it , slide after him , squeak and hiss on the ice-slope .
That be enough for Kotuko .
He have be bring up to believe that every rock and boulder have it owner -LRB- it inua -RRB- , who be generally a one-eyed kind of a Woman-Thing call a tornaq , and that when a tornaq meant to help a man she roll after him inside her stone house , and ask him whether he would take her for a guardian spirit .
-LRB- In summer thaw the ice-propped rock and boulder roll and slip all over the face of the land , so you can easily see how the idea of live stone arose . -RRB-
Kotuko hear the blood beating in his ear a he have hear it all day , and he think that be the tornaq of the stone speaking to him .
Before he reach home he be quite certain that he have hold a long conversation with her , and a all his people believe that this be quite possible , no one contradict him .
`` She say to me , ' I jump down , I jump down from my place on the snow , ' '' cry Kotuko , with hollow eye , lean forward in the half-lighted hut .
`` She say , ' I will be a guide . '
She say , ' I will guide you to the good seal-holes . '
To-morrow I go out , and the tornaq will guide me . ''
Then the angekok , the village sorcerer , come in , and Kotuko tell him the tale a second time .
It lose nothing in the telling .
`` Follow the tornait -LSB- the spirit of the stone -RSB- , and they will bring u food again , '' say the angekok .
Now the girl from the North have be lie near the lamp , eat very little and say less for day past ; but when Amoraq and Kadlu next morning pack and lash a little hand-sleigh for Kotuko , and load it with his hunting-gear and as much blubber and frozen seal-meat a they could spare , she take the pulling-rope , and step out boldly at the boy 's side .
`` Your house be my house , '' she say , a the little bone-shod sleigh squeak and bump behind them in the awful Arctic night .
`` My house be your house , '' say Kotuko ; `` but I think that we shall both go to Sedna together . ''
Now Sedna be the Mistress of the Underworld , and the Inuit believe that every one who die must spend a year in her horrible country before go to Quadliparmiut , the Happy Place , where it never freeze and the fat reindeer trot up when you call .
Through the village people be shout : `` The tornait have speak to Kotuko .
They will show him open ice .
He will bring u the seal again ! ''
Their voice be soon swallow up by the cold , empty dark , and Kotuko and the girl shoulder close together a they strain on the pulling-rope or humour the sleigh through the ice in the direction of the Polar Sea .
Kotuko insist that the tornaq of the stone have tell him to go north , and north they go under Tuktuqdjung the Reindeer -- those star that we call the Great Bear .
No European could have make five mile a day over the ice-rubbish and the sharp-edged drift ; but those two know exactly the turn of the wrist that coax a sleigh round a hummock , the jerk that nearly lift it out of an ice-crack , and the exact strength that go to the few quiet stroke of the spear-head that make a path possible when everything look hopeless .
The girl say nothing , but bow her head , and the long wolverine-fur fringe of her ermine hood blew across her broad , dark face .
The sky above them be an intense velvety black , change to band of Indian red on the horizon , where the great star burn like street-lamps .
From time to time a greenish wave of the Northern Lights would roll across the hollow of the high heaven , flick like a flag , and disappear ; or a meteor would crackle from darkness to darkness , trail a shower of spark behind .
Then they could see the ridged and furrow surface of the floe tip and lace with strange colour -- red , copper , and bluish ; but in the ordinary starlight everything turn to one frost-bitten gray .
The floe , a you will remember , have be batter and torment by the autumn gale till it be one frozen earthquake .
There be gully and ravine , and hole like gravel-pits , cut in ice ; lump and scatter piece freeze down to the original floor of the floe ; blotch of old black ice that have be thrust under the floe in some gale and heave up again ; roundish boulder of ice ; saw-like edge of ice carve by the snow that fly before the wind ; and sink pit where thirty or forty acre lay below the level of the rest of the field .
From a little distance you might have take the lump for seal or walrus , overturn sleigh or men on a hunting expedition , or even the great Ten-legged White Spirit-Bear himself ; but in spite of these fantastic shape , all on the very edge of start into life , there be neither sound nor the least faint echo of sound .
And through this silence and through this waste , where the sudden light flap and go out again , the sleigh and the two that pull it crawl like thing in a nightmare -- a nightmare of the end of the world at the end of the world .
When they be tire Kotuko would make what the hunter call a `` half-house , '' a very small snow hut , into which they would huddle with the travelling-lamp , and try to thaw out the frozen seal-meat .
When they have sleep , the march begin again -- thirty mile a day to get ten mile northward .
The girl be always very silent , but Kotuko mutter to himself and break out into song he have learn in the Singing-House -- summer song , and reindeer and salmon song -- all horribly out of place at that season .
He would declare that he hear the tornaq growl to him , and would run wildly up a hummock , toss his arm and speaking in loud , threatening tone .
To tell the truth , Kotuko be very nearly crazy for the time be ; but the girl be sure that he be be guide by his guardian spirit , and that everything would come right .
She be not surprised , therefore , when at the end of the fourth march Kotuko , whose eye be burn like fire-balls in his head , tell her that his tornaq be follow them across the snow in the shape of a two-headed dog .
The girl look where Kotuko point , and something seem to slip into a ravine .
It be certainly not human , but everybody know that the tornait prefer to appear in the shape of bear and seal , and such like .
It might have be the Ten-legged White Spirit-Bear himself , or it might have be anything , for Kotuko and the girl be so starve that their eye be untrustworthy .
They have trap nothing , and see no trace of game since they have leave the village ; their food would not hold out for another week , and there be a gale coming .
A Polar storm can blow for ten day without a break , and all that while it be certain death to be abroad .
Kotuko lay up a snow-house large enough to take in the hand-sleigh -LRB- never be separate from your meat -RRB- , and while he be shape the last irregular block of ice that make the key-stone of the roof , he saw a Thing look at him from a little cliff of ice half a mile away .
The air be hazy , and the Thing seem to be forty foot long and ten foot high , with twenty foot of tail and a shape that quiver all along the outline .
The girl saw it too , but instead of cry aloud with terror , say quietly , `` That be Quiquern .
What come after ? ''
`` He will speak to me , '' say Kotuko ; but the snow-knife tremble in his hand a he speak , because however much a man may believe that he be a friend of strange and ugly spirit , he seldom like to be take quite at his word .
Quiquern , too , be the phantom of a gigantic toothless dog without any hair , who be suppose to live in the far North , and to wander about the country just before thing be go to happen .
They may be pleasant or unpleasant thing , but not even the sorcerer care to speak about Quiquern .
He make the dog go mad .
Like the Spirit-Bear , he have several extra pair of leg , -- six or eight , -- and this Thing jump up and down in the haze have more leg than any real dog need .
Kotuko and the girl huddle into their hut quickly .
Of course if Quiquern have want them , he could have tear it to piece above their head , but the sense of a foot-thick snow-wall between themselves and the wicked dark be great comfort .
The gale broke with a shriek of wind like the shriek of a train , and for three day and three night it hold , never vary one point , and never lull even for a minute .
They feed the stone lamp between their knee , and nibble at the half-warm seal-meat , and watch the black soot gather on the roof for seventy-two long hour .
The girl count up the food in the sleigh ; there be not more than two day ' supply , and Kotuko look over the iron head and the deer-sinew fastening of his harpoon and his seal-lance and his bird-dart .
There be nothing else to do .
`` We shall go to Sedna soon -- very soon , '' the girl whisper .
`` In three day we shall lie down and go .
Will your tornaq do nothing ?
Sing her an angekok 's song to make her come here . ''
He begin to sing in the high-pitched howl of the magic song , and the gale go down slowly .
In the middle of his song the girl start , lay her mittened hand and then her head to the ice floor of the hut .
Kotuko follow her example , and the two kneel , star into each other 's eye , and listen with every nerve .
He rip a thin sliver of whalebone from the rim of a bird-snare that lay on the sleigh , and , after straighten , set it upright in a little hole in the ice , firm it down with his mitten .
It be almost a delicately adjust a a compass-needle , and now instead of listen they watch .
The thin rod quiver a little -- the least little jar in the world ; then it vibrate steadily for a few second , come to rest , and vibrate again , this time nod to another point of the compass .
`` Too soon ! ''
say Kotuko .
`` Some big floe have break far away outside . ''
The girl point at the rod , and shake her head .
`` It be the big breaking , '' she say .
`` Listen to the ground-ice .
It knock . ''
When they kneel this time they hear the most curious muffle grunt and knocking , apparently under their foot .
Sometimes it sound a though a blind puppy be squeak above the lamp ; then a if a stone be be ground on hard ice ; and again , like muffle blow on a drum ; but all drag out and make small , a though they travel through a little horn a weary distance away .
`` We shall not go to Sedna lie down , '' say Kotuko .
`` It be the breaking .
The tornaq have cheat u .
We shall die . ''
All this may sound absurd enough , but the two be face to face with a very real danger .
The three day ' gale have drive the deep water of Baffin 's Bay southerly , and pile it on to the edge of the far-reaching land-ice that stretch from Bylot 's Island to the west .
Also , the strong current which set east out of Lancaster Sound carry with it mile upon mile of what they call pack-ice -- rough ice that have not freeze into field ; and this pack be bombard the floe at the same time that the swell and heave of the storm-worked sea be weaken and undermine it .
What Kotuko and the girl have be listen to be the faint echo of that fight thirty or forty mile away , and the little tell-tale rod quiver to the shock of it .
Now , a the Inuit say , when the ice once wake after it long winter sleep , there be no know what may happen , for solid floe-ice change shape almost as quickly a a cloud .
The gale be evidently a spring gale send out of time , and anything be possible .
Yet the two be happier in their mind than before .
If the floe break up there would be no more waiting and suffering .
Spirits , goblin , and witch-people be move about on the racking ice , and they might find themselves step into Sedna 's country side by side with all sort of wild Things , the flush of excitement still on them .
When they leave the hut after the gale , the noise on the horizon be steadily grow , and the tough ice moan and buzz all round them .
`` It be still wait , '' say Kotuko .
On the top of a hummock sit or crouch the eight-legged Thing that they have see three day before -- and it howl horribly .
`` Let u follow , '' say the girl .
`` It may know some way that do not lead to Sedna '' ; but she reel from weakness a she take the pulling-rope .
The Thing move off slowly and clumsily across the ridge , head always toward the westward and the land , and they follow , while the growl thunder at the edge of the floe roll nearer and nearer .
The floe 's lip be split and crack in every direction for three or four mile inland , and great pan of ten-foot-thick ice , from a few yard to twenty acre square , be jolt and duck and surge into one another , and into the yet unbroken floe , a the heavy swell take and shook and spout between them .
This battering-ram ice be , so to speak , the first army that the sea be fling against the floe .
The incessant crash and jar of these cake almost drown the rip sound of sheet of pack-ice driven bodily under the floe a card be hastily push under a tablecloth .
Where the water be shallow these sheet would be pile one atop of the other till the bottommost touch mud fifty foot down , and the discoloured sea bank behind the muddy ice till the increase pressure drive all forward again .
In addition to the floe and the pack-ice , the gale and the current be bring down true berg , sail mountain of ice , snap off from the Greenland side of the water or the north shore of Melville Bay .
They pound in solemnly , the wave break white round them , and advance on the floe like an old-time fleet under full sail .
A berg that seem ready to carry the world before it would grind helplessly in deep water , reel over , and wallow in a lather of foam and mud and fly frozen spray , while a much small and low one would rip and ride into the flat floe , fling ton of ice on either side , and cut a track half a mile long before it be stop .
Some fell like sword , shear a raw-edged canal ; and others splinter into a shower of block , weigh score of ton apiece , that whirl and skirt among the hummock .
Others , again , rise up bodily out of the water when they shoal , twist a though in pain , and fell solidly on their side , while the sea thresh over their shoulder .
This trampling and crowding and bending and buckling and arching of the ice into every possible shape be go on as far a the eye could reach all along the north line of the floe .
From where Kotuko and the girl be , the confusion look no more than an uneasy , ripple , crawl movement under the horizon ; but it come toward them each moment , and they could hear , far away to landward a heavy booming , a it might have be the boom of artillery through a fog .
That show that the floe be be jam home against the iron cliff of Bylot 's Island , the land to the southward behind them .
`` This have never be before , '' say Kotuko , star stupidly .
`` This be not the time .
How can the floe break NOW ? ''
`` Follow THAT ! ''
the girl cry , point to the Thing half limping , half run distractedly before them .
They follow , tug at the hand-sleigh , while nearer and nearer come the roar march of the ice .
At last the field round them crack and star in every direction , and the crack open and snap like the teeth of wolf .
But where the Thing rest , on a mound of old and scatter ice-blocks some fifty foot high , there be no motion .
Kotuko leap forward wildly , drag the girl after him , and crawl to the bottom of the mound .
The talk of the ice grow loud and louder round them , but the mound stay fast , and , a the girl look at him , he throw his right elbow upward and outward , make the Inuit sign for land in the shape of an island .
And land it be that the eight-legged , limping Thing have lead them to -- some granite-tipped , sand-beached islet off the coast , shod and sheathe and mask with ice so that no man could have tell it from the floe , but at the bottom solid earth , and not shift ice !
The smashing and rebound of the floe a they ground and splinter mark the border of it , and a friendly shoal run out to the northward , and turn aside the rush of the heavy ice , exactly a a ploughshare turn over loam .
There be danger , of course , that some heavily squeeze ice-field might shoot up the beach , and plane off the top of the islet bodily ; but that do not trouble Kotuko and the girl when they make their snow-house and begin to eat , and hear the ice hammer and skid along the beach .
The Thing have disappear , and Kotuko be talk excitedly about his power over spirit a he crouch round the lamp .
In the middle of his wild saying the girl begin to laugh , and rock herself backward and forward .
Behind her shoulder , crawl into the hut crawl by crawl , there be two head , one yellow and one black , that belong to two of the most sorrowful and ashamed dog that ever you saw .
Kotuko the dog be one , and the black leader be the other .
Both be now fat , well-looking , and quite restore to their proper mind , but couple to each other in an extraordinary fashion .
When the black leader run off , you remember , his harness be still on him .
He must have meet Kotuko the dog , and play or fight with him , for his shoulder-loop have catch in the plaited copper wire of Kotuko 's collar , and have draw tight , so that neither could get at the trace to gnaw it apart , but each be fasten sidelong to his neighbour 's neck .
That , with the freedom of hunt on their own account , must have help to cure their madness .
They be very sober .
The girl push the two shamefaced creature towards Kotuko , and , sob with laughter , cry , `` That be Quiquern , who lead u to safe ground .
Look at his eight leg and double head ! ''
Kotuko cut them free , and they fell into his arm , yellow and black together , try to explain how they have get their sens back again .
Kotuko run a hand down their rib , which be round and well clothe .
`` They have find food , '' he say , with a grin .
`` I do not think we shall go to Sedna so soon .
My tornaq send these .
The sickness have leave them . ''
As soon a they have greet Kotuko , these two , who have be force to sleep and eat and hunt together for the past few week , fly at each other 's throat , and there be a beautiful battle in the snow-house .
`` Empty dog do not fight , '' Kotuko say .
`` They have find the seal .
Let u sleep .
We shall find food . ''
When they wake there be open water on the north beach of the island , and all the loosened ice have be drive landward .
The first sound of the surf be one of the most delightful that the Inuit can hear , for it mean that spring be on the road .
Kotuko and the girl take hold of hand and smile , for the clear , full roar of the surge among the ice remind them of salmon and reindeer time and the smell of blossom ground-willows .
Even a they look , the sea begin to skim over between the float cake of ice , so intense be the cold ; but on the horizon there be a vast red glare , and that be the light of the sunken sun .
It be more like hear him yawn in his sleep than see him rise , and the glare last for only a few minute , but it mark the turn of the year .
Nothing , they felt , could alter that .
Kotuko find the dog fight over a fresh-killed seal who be follow the fish that a gale always disturbs .
He be the first of some twenty or thirty seal that land on the island in the course of the day , and till the sea froze hard there be hundred of keen black head rejoice in the shallow free water and float about with the float ice .
It be good to eat seal-liver again ; to fill the lamp recklessly with blubber , and watch the flame blaze three foot in the air ; but as soon a the new sea-ice bore , Kotuko and the girl load the hand-sleigh , and make the two dog pull a they have never pull in their life , for they fear what might have happen in their village .
The weather be as pitiless a usual ; but it be easy to draw a sleigh load with good food than to hunt starving .
They leave five-and-twenty seal carcass bury in the ice of the beach , all ready for use , and hurry back to their people .
The dog show them the way as soon a Kotuko tell them what be expect , and though there be no sign of a landmark , in two day they be give tongue outside Kadlu 's house .
Only three dog answer them ; the others have be eat , and the house be all dark .
But when Kotuko shout , `` Ojo ! ''
-LRB- boil meat -RRB- , weak voice reply , and when he call the muster of the village name by name , very distinctly , there be no gap in it .
An hour later the lamp blaze in Kadlu 's house ; snow-water be heat ; the pot be begin to simmer , and the snow be drip from the roof , a Amoraq make ready a meal for all the village , and the boy-baby in the hood chew at a strip of rich nutty blubber , and the hunter slowly and methodically fill themselves to the very brim with seal-meat .
Kotuko and the girl tell their tale .
The two dog sit between them , and whenever their name come in , they cock an ear apiece and look most thoroughly ashamed of themselves .
A dog who have once go mad and recover , the Inuit say , be safe against all further attack .
`` So the tornaq do not forget u , '' say Kotuko .
`` The storm blew , the ice break , and the seal swam in behind the fish that be frighten by the storm .
Now the new seal-holes be not two day distant .
Let the good hunter go to-morrow and bring back the seal I have spear -- twenty-five seal bury in the ice .
When we have eat those we will all follow the seal on the floe . ''
`` What do YOU do ? ''
say the sorcerer in the same sort of voice a he use to Kadlu , richest of the Tununirmiut .
Kadlu look at the girl from the North , and say quietly , `` WE build a house . ''
He point to the north-west side of Kadlu 's house , for that be the side on which the married son or daughter always live .
The girl turn her hand palm upward , with a little despair shake of her head .
She be a foreigner , pick up starving , and could bring nothing to the housekeeping .
Amoraq jump from the bench where she sit , and begin to sweep thing into the girl 's lap -- stone lamp , iron skin-scrapers , tin kettle , deer-skins embroider with musk-ox teeth , and real canvas-needles such a sailor use -- the fine dowry that have ever be give on the far edge of the Arctic Circle , and the girl from the North bow her head down to the very floor .
`` Also these ! ''
say Kotuko , laugh and sign to the dog , who thrust their cold muzzle into the girl 's face .
`` Ah , '' say the angekok , with an important cough , a though he have be think it all over .
`` As soon a Kotuko leave the village I go to the Singing-House and sing magic .
I sing all the long night , and call upon the Spirit of the Reindeer .
MY singing make the gale blow that break the ice and draw the two dog toward Kotuko when the ice would have crush his bone .
MY song draw the seal in behind the broken ice .
My body lay still in the quaggi , but my spirit run about on the ice , and guide Kotuko and the dog in all the thing they do .
I do it . ''
Everybody be full and sleepy , so no one contradict ; and the angekok , by virtue of his office , help himself to yet another lump of boiled meat , and lay down to sleep with the others in the warm , well-lighted , oil-smelling home .
***** Now Kotuko , who draw very well in the Inuit fashion , scratch picture of all these adventure on a long , flat piece of ivory with a hole at one end .
When he and the girl go north to Ellesmere Land in the year of the Wonderful Open Winter , he leave the picture-story with Kadlu , who lose it in the shingle when his dog-sleigh break down one summer on the beach of Lake Netilling at Nikosiring , and there a Lake Inuit find it next spring and sell it to a man at Imigen who be interpreter on a Cumberland Sound whaler , and he sell it to Hans Olsen , who be afterward a quartermaster on board a big steamer that take tourist to the North Cape in Norway .
When the tourist season be over , the steamer run between London and Australia , stop at Ceylon , and there Olsen sell the ivory to a Cingalese jeweller for two imitation sapphire .
I find it under some rubbish in a house at Colombo , and have translate it from one end to the other .
` ANGUTIVAUN TAINA ' -LSB- This be a very free translation of the Song of the Returning Hunter , a the men use to sing it after seal-spearing .
The Inuit always repeat thing over and over again . -RSB-
Our glove be stiff with the frozen blood , Our fur with the drift snow , As we come in with the seal -- the seal !
In from the edge of the floe .
Au jana !
Aua !
Oha !
Haq !
And the yelping dog-teams go , And the long whip crack , and the men come back , Back from the edge of the floe !
We track our seal to his secret place , We hear him scratch below , We make our mark , and we watch beside , Out on the edge of the floe .
We raise our lance when he rise to breathe , We drive it downward -- so !
And we play him thus , and we kill him thus , Out on the edge of the floe .
Our glove be glue with the frozen blood , Our eye with the drifting snow ; But we come back to our wife again , Back from the edge of the floe !
Au jana !
Aua !
Oha !
Haq !
And the loaded dog-teams go , And the wife can hear their men come back .
Back from the edge of the floe !
RED DOG For our white and our excellent night -- for the night of swift run .
Fair ranging , far see , good hunting , sure cunning !
For the smell of the dawning , untainted , ere dew have depart !
For the rush through the mist , and the quarry blind-started !
For the cry of our mate when the sambhur have wheel and be stand at bay , For the risk and the riot of night !
For the sleep at the lair-mouth by day , It be meet , and we go to the fight .
Bay !
O Bay !
It be after the letting in of the Jungle that the pleasant part of Mowgli 's life begin .
He have the good conscience that come from pay debt ; all the Jungle be his friend , and just a little afraid of him .
The thing that he do and saw and heard when he be wander from one people to another , with or without his four companion , would make many many story , each as long a this one .
So you will never be told how he meet the Mad Elephant of Mandla , who kill two-and-twenty bullock draw eleven cart of coin silver to the Government Treasury , and scatter the shiny rupee in the dust ; how he fight Jacala , the Crocodile , all one long night in the Marshes of the North , and break his skinning-knife on the brute 's back-plates ; how he find a new and long knife round the neck of a man who have be kill by a wild boar , and how he track that boar and kill him a a fair price for the knife ; how he be catch up once in the Great Famine , by the moving of the deer , and nearly crush to death in the swaying hot herd ; how he save Hathi the Silent from be once more trapped in a pit with a stake at the bottom , and how , next day , he himself fell into a very cunning leopard-trap , and how Hathi break the thick wooden bar to piece above him ; how he milk the wild buffalo in the swamp , and how -- But we must tell one tale at a time .
Father and Mother Wolf die , and Mowgli roll a big boulder against the mouth of their cave , and cry the Death Song over them ; Baloo grow very old and stiff , and even Bagheera , whose nerve be steel and whose muscle be iron , be a shade slower on the kill than he have be .
Akela turn from gray to milky white with pure age ; his rib stick out , and he walk a though he have be make of wood , and Mowgli kill for him .
But the young wolf , the child of the disbanded Seeonee Pack , throve and increase , and when there be about forty of them , masterless , full-voiced , clean-footed five-year-olds , Akela tell them that they ought to gather themselves together and follow the Law , and run under one head , a befit the Free People .
This be not a question in which Mowgli concern himself , for , a he say , he have eat sour fruit , and he know the tree it hang from ; but when Phao , son of Phaona -LRB- his father be the Gray Tracker in the day of Akela 's headship -RRB- , fight his way to the leadership of the Pack , accord to the Jungle Law , and the old call and song begin to ring under the star once more , Mowgli come to the Council Rock for memory 's sake .
When he choose to speak the Pack wait till he have finish , and he sit at Akela 's side on the rock above Phao .
Those be day of good hunting and good sleeping .
No stranger care to break into the jungle that belong to Mowgli 's people , a they call the Pack , and the young wolf grow fat and strong , and there be many cub to bring to the Looking-over .
Mowgli always attend a Looking-over , remember the night when a black panther buy a naked brown baby into the pack , and the long call , `` Look , look well , O Wolves , '' make his heart flutter .
Otherwise , he would be far away in the Jungle with his four brother , taste , touch , see , and feel new thing .
One twilight when he be trot leisurely across the range to give Akela the half of a buck that he have kill , while the Four jog behind him , spar a little , and tumble one another over for joy of be alive , he hear a cry that have never be hear since the bad day of Shere Khan .
It be what they call in the Jungle the pheeal , a hideous kind of shriek that the jackal give when he be hunt behind a tiger , or when there be a big killing afoot .
If you can imagine a mixture of hate , triumph , fear , and despair , with a kind of leer run through it , you will get some notion of the pheeal that rise and sank and waver and quaver far away across the Waingunga .
The Four stop at once , bristle and growl .
Mowgli 's hand go to his knife , and he check , the blood in his face , his eyebrow knot .
`` There be no Striped One dare kill here , '' he say .
`` That be not the cry of the Forerunner , '' answer Gray Brother .
`` It be some great killing .
Listen ! ''
It break out again , half sobbing and half chuckling , just a though the jackal have soft human lip .
Then Mowgli draw deep breath , and run to the Council Rock , overtake on his way hurry wolf of the Pack .
Phao and Akela be on the Rock together , and below them , every nerve strain , sit the others .
The mother and the cub be canter off to their lair ; for when the pheeal cry it be no time for weak thing to be abroad .
They could hear nothing except the Waingunga rushing and gurgling in the dark , and the light even wind among the tree-tops , till suddenly across the river a wolf call .
It be no wolf of the Pack , for they be all at the Rock .
The note change to a long , despair bay ; and `` Dhole ! ''
it say , `` Dhole !
dhole !
dhole ! ''
They hear tired foot on the rock , and a gaunt wolf , streak with red on his flank , his right fore-paw useless , and his jaws white with foam , flung himself into the circle and lay gasp at Mowgli 's foot .
`` Good hunting !
Under whose Headship ? ''
say Phao gravely .
`` Good hunting !
Won-tolla be I , '' be the answer .
He mean that he be a solitary wolf , fend for himself , his mate , and his cub in some lonely lair , a do many wolf in the south .
Won-tolla mean an Outlier -- one who lie out from any Pack .
Then he pant , and they could see his heart-beats shake him backward and forward .
`` What move ? ''
say Phao , for that be the question all the Jungle ask after the pheeal cry .
`` The dhole , the dhole of the Dekkan -- Red Dog , the Killer !
They come north from the south say the Dekkan be empty and kill out by the way .
When this moon be new there be four to me -- my mate and three cub .
She would teach them to kill on the grass plain , hide to drive the buck , a we do who be of the open .
At midnight I hear them together , full tongue on the trail .
At the dawn-wind I find them stiff in the grass -- four , Free People , four when this moon be new .
Then seek I my Blood-Right and find the dhole . ''
`` How many ? ''
say Mowgli quickly ; the Pack growl deep in their throat .
`` I do not know .
Three of them will kill no more , but at the last they drive me like the buck ; on my three leg they drive me .
Look , Free People ! ''
He thrust out his mangled fore-foot , all dark with dried blood .
There be cruel bite low down on his side , and his throat be tear and worry .
`` Eat , '' say Akela , rise up from the meat Mowgli have bring him , and the Outlier flung himself on it .
`` This shall be no loss , '' he say humbly , when he have take off the first edge of his hunger .
`` Give me a little strength , Free People , and I also will kill .
My lair be empty that be full when this moon be new , and the Blood Debt be not all pay . ''
Phao hear his teeth crack on a haunch-bone and grunt approvingly .
`` We shall need those jaw , '' say he .
`` Were there cub with the dhole ? ''
`` Nay , nay .
Red Hunters all : grown dog of their Pack , heavy and strong for all that they eat lizard in the Dekkan . ''
What Won-tolla have say meant that the dhole , the red hunting-dog of the Dekkan , be move to kill , and the Pack know well that even the tiger will surrender a new kill to the dhole .
They drive straight through the Jungle , and what they meet they pull down and tear to piece .
Though they be not a big nor half as cunning a the wolf , they be very strong and very numerous .
The dhole , for instance , do not begin to call themselves a pack till they be a hundred strong ; whereas forty wolf make a very fair pack indeed .
Mowgli 's wandering have take him to the edge of the high grassy down of the Dekkan , and he have see the fearless dholes sleep and playing and scratch themselves in the little hollow and tussock that they use for lair .
He despise and hat them because they do not smell like the Free People , because they do not live in cave , and , above all , because they have hair between their toe while he and his friend be clean-footed .
But he know , for Hathi have tell him , what a terrible thing a dhole hunting-pack be .
Even Hathi move aside from their line , and until they be kill , or till game be scarce , they will go forward .
Akela know something of the dhole , too , for he say to Mowgli quietly , `` It be well to die in a Full Pack than leaderless and alone .
This be good hunting , and -- my last .
But , a men live , thou hast very many more night and day , Little Brother .
Go north and lie down , and if any live after the dhole have go by he shall bring thee word of the fight . ''
`` Ah , '' say Mowgli , quite gravely , `` must I go to the marsh and catch little fish and sleep in a tree , or must I ask help of the Bandar-log and crack nut , while the Pack fight below ? ''
`` It be to the death , '' say Akela .
`` Thou hast never meet the dhole -- the Red Killer .
Even the Striped One -- '' `` Aowa !
Aowa ! ''
say Mowgli pettingly .
`` I have kill one striped ape , and sure be I in my stomach that Shere Khan would have leave his own mate for meat to the dhole if he have wind a pack across three range .
Listen now : There be a wolf , my father , and there be a wolf , my mother , and there be an old gray wolf -LRB- not too wise : he be white now -RRB- be my father and my mother .
Therefore I -- '' he raise his voice , `` I say that when the dhole come , and if the dhole come , Mowgli and the Free People be of one skin for that hunting ; and I say , by the Bull that buy me -- by the Bull Bagheera pay for me in the old day which ye of the Pack do not remember -- I say , that the Trees and the River may hear and hold fast if I forget ; I say that this my knife shall be a a tooth to the Pack -- and I do not think it be so blunt .
This be my Word which have go from me . ''
`` Thou dost not know the dhole , man with a wolf 's tongue , '' say Won-tolla .
`` I look only to clear the Blood Debt against them ere they have me in many piece .
They move slowly , kill out a they go , but in two day a little strength will come back to me and I turn again for the Blood Debt .
But for YE , Free People , my word be that ye go north and eat but little for a while till the dhole be go .
There be no meat in this hunting . ''
`` Hear the Outlier ! ''
say Mowgli with a laugh .
`` Free People , we must go north and dig lizard and rat from the bank , l by any chance we meet the dhole .
He must kill out our hunting-grounds , while we lie hid in the north till it please him to give u our own again .
He be a dog -- and the pup of a dog -- red , yellow-bellied , lairless , and haired between every toe !
He count his cub six and eight at the litter , a though he be Chikai , the little leaping rat .
Surely we must run away , Free People , and beg leave of the people of the north for the offal of dead cattle !
Ye know the saying : ` North be the vermin ; south be the louse .
WE be the Jungle . '
Choose ye , O choose .
It be good hunting !
For the Pack -- for the Full Pack -- for the lair and the litter ; for the in-kill and the out-kill ; for the mate that drive the doe and the little , little cub within the cave ; it be meet !
-- it be meet !
-- it be meet ! ''
The Pack answer with one deep , crash bark that sound in the night like a big tree fall .
`` It be meet ! ''
they cry .
`` Stay with these , '' say Mowgli to the Four .
`` We shall need every tooth .
Phao and Akela must make ready the battle .
I go to count the dog . ''
`` It be death ! ''
Won-tolla cry , half rising .
`` What can such a hairless one do against the Red Dog ?
Even the Striped One , remember -- '' `` Thou art indeed an Outlier , '' Mowgli call back ; `` but we will speak when the dhole be dead .
Good hunt all ! ''
He hurry off into the darkness , wild with excitement , hardly look where he set foot , and the natural consequence be that he trip full length over Kaa 's great coil where the python lay watch a deer-path near the river .
`` Kssha ! ''
say Kaa angrily .
`` Is this jungle-work , to stamp and tramp and undo a night 's hunting -- when the game be move so well , too ? ''
`` The fault be mine , '' say Mowgli , pick himself up .
`` Indeed I be seek thee , Flathead , but each time we meet thou art longer and broader by the length of my arm .
There be none like thee in the Jungle , wise , old , strong , and most beautiful Kaa . ''
`` Now whither do THIS trail lead ? ''
Kaa 's voice be gentler .
`` Not a moon since there be a Manling with a knife throw stone at my head and call me bad little tree-cat name , because I lay asleep in the open . ''
`` Ay , and turn every driven deer to all the wind , and Mowgli be hunt , and this same Flathead be too deaf to hear his whistle , and leave the deer-roads free , '' Mowgli answer composedly , sit down among the paint coil .
`` Now this same Manling come with soft , tickle word to this same Flathead , tell him that he be wise and strong and beautiful , and this same old Flathead believe and make a place , thus , for this same stone-throwing Manling , and -- Art thou at ease now ?
Could Bagheera give thee so good a resting-place ? ''
Kaa have , a usual , make a sort of soft half-hammock of himself under Mowgli 's weight .
The boy reach out in the darkness , and gather in the supple cable-like neck till Kaa 's head rest on his shoulder , and then he tell him all that have happen in the Jungle that night .
`` Wise I may be , '' say Kaa at the end ; `` but deaf I surely be .
Else I should have hear the pheeal .
Small wonder the Eaters of Grass be uneasy .
How many be the dhole ? ''
`` I have not yet see .
I come hot-foot to thee .
Thou art old than Hathi .
But oh , Kaa , '' -- here Mowgli wriggle with sheerjoy , -- `` it will be good hunting .
Few of u will see another moon . ''
`` Dost THOU strike in this ?
Remember thou art a Man ; and remember what Pack cast thee out .
Let the Wolf look to the Dog .
THOU art a Man . ''
`` Last year 's nut be this year 's black earth , '' say Mowgli .
`` It be true that I be a Man , but it be in my stomach that this night I have say that I be a Wolf .
I call the River and the Trees to remember .
I be of the Free People , Kaa , till the dhole have go by . ''
`` Free People , '' Kaa grunt .
`` Free thief !
And thou hast tie thyself into the death-knot for the sake of the memory of the dead wolf ?
This be no good hunting . ''
`` It be my Word which I have speak .
The Trees know , the River know .
Till the dhole have go by my Word come not back to me . ''
`` Ngssh !
This change all trail .
I have think to take thee away with me to the northern marsh , but the Word -- even the Word of a little , naked , hairless Manling -- be the Word .
Now I , Kaa , say -- '' `` Think well , Flathead , l thou tie thyself into the death-knot also .
I need no Word from thee , for well I know -- '' `` Be it so , then , '' say Kaa .
`` I will give no Word ; but what be in thy stomach to do when the dhole come ? ''
`` They must swim the Waingunga .
I think to meet them with my knife in the shallow , the Pack behind me ; and so stabbing and thrusting , we a little might turn them down-stream , or cool their throat . ''
`` The dhole do not turn and their throat be hot , '' say Kaa .
`` There will be neither Manling nor Wolf-cub when that hunting be do , but only dry bone . ''
`` Alala !
If we die , we die .
It will be most good hunting .
But my stomach be young , and I have not see many Rains .
I be not wise nor strong .
Hast thou a good plan , Kaa ? ''
`` I have see a hundred and a hundred Rains .
Ere Hathi cast his milk-tushes my trail be big in the dust .
By the First Egg , I be old than many tree , and I have see all that the Jungle have do . ''
`` But THIS be new hunting , '' say Mowgli .
`` Never before have the dhole cross our trail . ''
`` What be have be .
What will be be no more than a forgotten year strike backward .
Be still while I count those my year . ''
For a long hour Mowgli lay back among the coil , while Kaa , his head motionless on the ground , think of all that he have see and know since the day he come from the egg .
The light seem to go out of his eye and leave them like stale opal , and now and again he make little stiff pass with his head , right and leave , a though he be hunt in his sleep .
Mowgli doze quietly , for he know that there be nothing like sleep before hunting , and he be train to take it at any hour of the day or night .
Then he felt Kaa 's back grow big and broad below him a the huge python puff himself out , hiss with the noise of a sword drawn from a steel scabbard .
`` I have see all the dead season , '' Kaa say at last , `` and the great tree and the old elephant , and the rock that be bare and sharp-pointed ere the moss grow .
Art THOU still alive , Manling ? ''
`` It be only a little after moonset , '' say Mowgli .
`` I do not understand -- '' `` Hssh !
I be again Kaa .
I know it be but a little time .
Now we will go to the river , and I will show thee what be to be do against the dhole . ''
He turn , straight a an arrow , for the main stream of the Waingunga , plunge in a little above the pool that hide the Peace Rock , Mowgli at his side .
`` Nay , do not swim .
I go swiftly .
My back , Little Brother . ''
Mowgli tuck his left arm round Kaa 's neck , drop his right close to his body , and straighten his foot .
Then Kaa breast the current a he alone could , and the ripple of the checked water stand up in a frill round Mowgli 's neck , and his foot be wave to and fro in the eddy under the python 's lashing side .
A mile or two above the Peace Rock the Waingunga narrow between a gorge of marble rock from eighty to a hundred foot high , and the current run like a mill-race between and over all manner of ugly stone .
But Mowgli do not trouble his head about the water ; little water in the world could have give him a moment 's fear .
He be look at the gorge on either side and sniff uneasily , for there be a sweetish-sourish smell in the air , very like the smell of a big ant-hill on a hot day .
Instinctively he lower himself in the water , only raise his head to breathe from time to time , and Kaa come to anchor with a double twist of his tail round a sunken rock , hold Mowgli in the hollow of a coil , while the water race on .
`` This be the Place of Death , '' say the boy .
`` Why do we come here ? ''
`` They sleep , '' say Kaa .
`` Hathi will not turn aside for the Striped One .
Yet Hathi and the Striped One together turn aside for the dhole , and the dhole they say turn aside for nothing .
And yet for whom do the Little People of the Rocks turn aside ?
Tell me , Master of the Jungle , who be the Master of the Jungle ? ''
`` These , '' Mowgli whisper .
`` It be the Place of Death .
Let u go . ''
`` Nay , look well , for they be asleep .
It be a it be when I be not the length of thy arm . ''
The split and weatherworn rock of the gorge of the Waingunga have be use since the beginning of the Jungle by the Little People of the Rocks -- the busy , furious , black wild bee of India ; and , a Mowgli know well , all trail turn off half a mile before they reach the gorge .
For century the Little People have hive and swarm from cleft to cleave , and swarm again , stain the white marble with stale honey , and make their comb tall and deep in the dark of the inner cave , where neither man nor beast nor fire nor water have ever touch them .
The length of the gorge on both siaes be hang a it be with black shimmery velvet curtain , and Mowgli sink a he look , for those be the clotted million of the sleeping bee .
There be other lump and festoon and thing like decayed tree-trunks stud on the face of the rock , the old comb of past year , or new city build in the shadow of the windless gorge , and huge mass of spongy , rotten trash have roll down and stick among the tree and creeper that cling to the rock-face .
As he listen he hear more than once the rustle and slide of a honey-loaded comb turn over or fail away somewhere in the dark gallery ; then a booming of angry wing , and the sullen drip , drip , drip , of the wasted honey , gutter along till it lipped over some ledge in the open air and sluggishly trickle down on the twig .
There be a tiny little beach , not five foot broad , on one side of the river , and that be pile high with the rubbish of uncounted year .
There be dead bee , drone , sweeping , and stale comb , and wing of maraud moth that have stray in after honey , all tumble in smooth pile of the fine black dust .
The mere sharp smell of it be enough to frighten anything that have no wing , and know what the Little People be .
Kaa move up-stream again till he come to a sandy bar at the head of the gorge .
`` Here be this season 's kill , '' say he .
`` Look ! ''
On the bank lay the skeleton of a couple of young deer and a buffalo .
Mowgli could see that neither wolf nor jackal have touch the hone , which be lay out naturally .
`` They come beyond the line ; they do not know the Law , '' murmur Mowgli , `` and the Little People kill them .
Let u go ere they wake . ''
`` They do not wake till the dawn , '' say Kaa .
`` Now I will tell thee .
A hunted buck from the south , many , many Rains ago , come hither from the south , not know the Jungle , a Pack on his trail .
Being make blind by fear , he leap from above , the Pack running by sight , for they be hot and blind on the trail .
The sun be high , and the Little People be many and very angry .
Many , too , be those of the Pack who leap into the Waingunga , but they be dead ere they take water .
Those who do not leap die also in the rock above .
But the buck live . ''
`` How ? ''
`` Because he come first , run for his life , leap ere the Little People be aware , and be in the river when they gather to kill .
The Pack , follow , be altogether lose under the weight of the Little People . ''
`` The buck live ? ''
Mowgli repeat slowly .
`` At least he do not die THEN , though none wait his come down with a strong body to hold him safe against the water , a a certain old fat , deaf , yellow Flathead would wait for a Manling -- yea , though there be all the dhole of the Dekkan on his trail .
What be in thy stomach ? ''
Kaa 's head be close to Mowgli 's ear ; and it be a little time before the boy answer .
`` It be to pull the very whisker of Death , but -- Kaa , thou art , indeed , the wise of all the Jungle . ''
`` So many have say .
Look now , if the dhole follow thee -- '' `` As surely they will follow .
Ho !
ho !
I have many little thorn under my tongue to prick into their hide . ''
`` If they follow thee hot and blind , look only at thy shoulder , those who do not die up above will take water either here or low down , for the Little People will rise up and cover them .
Now the Waingunga be hungry water , and they will have no Kaa to hold them , but will go down , such a live , to the shallow by the Seeonee Lairs , and there thy Pack may meet them by the throat . ''
`` Ahai !
Eowawa !
Better could not be till the Rains fall in the dry season .
There be now only the little matter of the run and the leap .
I will make me know to the dhole , so that they shall follow me very closely . ''
`` Hast thou see the rock above thee ?
From the landward side ? ''
`` Indeed , no .
That I have forget . ''
`` Go look .
It be all rotten ground , cut and full of hole .
One of thy clumsy foot set down without see would end the hunt .
See , I leave thee here , and for thy sake only I will carry word to the Pack that they may know where to look for the dhole .
For myself , I be not of one skin with ANY wolf . ''
When Kaa dislike an acquaintance he could be more unpleasant than any of the Jungle People , except perhaps Bagheera .
He swim down-stream , and opposite the Rock he come on Phao and Akela listen to the night noise .
`` Hssh !
Dogs , '' he say cheerfully .
`` The dhole will come down-stream .
If ye be not afraid ye can kill them in the shallow . ''
`` When come they ? ''
say Phao .
`` And where be my Man-cub ? ''
say Akela .
`` They come when they come , '' say Kaa .
`` Wait and see .
As for THY Man-cub , from whom thou hast take a Word and so lay him open to Death , THY Man-cub be with ME , and if he be not already dead the fault be none of thine , bleach dog !
Wait here for the dhole , and be glad that the Man-cub and I strike on thy side . ''
Kaa flash up-stream again , and moor himself in the middle of the gorge , look upward at the line of the cliff .
Presently he saw Mowgli 's head move against the star , and then there be a whizz in the air , the keen , clean schloop of a body fall foot first , and next minute the boy be at rest again in the loop of Kaa 's body .
`` It be no leap by night , '' say Mowgli quietly .
`` I have jump twice a far for sport ; but that be an evil place above -- low bush and gully that go down very deep , all full of the Little People .
I have put big stone one above the other by the side of three gully .
These I shall throw down with my foot in running , and the Little People will rise up behind me , very angry . ''
`` That be Man 's talk and Man 's cunning , '' say Kaa .
`` Thou art wise , but the Little People be always angry . ''
`` Nay , at twilight all wing near and far rest for a while .
I will play with the dhole at twilight , for the dhole hunt best by day .
He follow now Won-tolla 's blood-trail . ''
`` Chil do not leave a dead ox , nor the dhole the blood-trail , '' say Kaa .
`` Then I will make him a new blood-trail , of his own blood , if I can , and give him dirt to eat .
Thou wilt stay here , Kaa , till I come again with my dhole ? ''
`` Ay , but what if they kill thee in the Jungle , or the Little People kill thee before thou canst leap down to the river ? ''
`` When to-morrow come we will kill for to-morrow , '' say Mowgli , quote a Jungle saying ; and again , `` When I be dead it be time to sing the Death Song .
Good hunting , Kaa ! ''
He loose his arm from the python 's neck and go down the gorge like a log in a freshet , paddle toward the far bank , where he find slack-water , and laugh aloud from sheer happiness .
There be nothing Mowgli like good than , a he himself say , `` to pull the whisker of Death , '' and make the Jungle know that he be their overlord .
He have often , with Baloo 's help , rob bee ' nest in single tree , and he know that the Little People hat the smell of wild garlic .
So he gather a small bundle of it , tie it up with a bark string , and then follow Won-tolla 's blood-trail , a it run southerly from the Lairs , for some five mile , look at the tree with his head on one side , and chuckle a he look .
`` Mowgli the Frog have I be , '' say he to himself ; `` Mowgli the Wolf have I say that I be .
Now Mowgli the Ape must I be before I be Mowgli the Buck .
At the end I shall be Mowgli the Man .
Ho ! ''
and he slide his thumb along the eighteen-inch blade of his knife .
Won-tolla 's trail , all rank with dark blood-spots , run under a forest of thick tree that grow close together and stretch away north-eastward , gradually grow thinner and thinner to within two mile of the Bee Rocks .
From the last tree to the low scrub of the Bee Rocks be open country , where there be hardly cover enough to hide a wolf .
Mowgli trot along under the tree , judge distance between branch and branch , occasionally climb up a trunk and take a trial leap from one tree to another till he come to the open ground , which he study very carefully for an hour .
Then he turn , pick up Won-tolla 's trail where he have leave it , settle himself in a tree with an outrun branch some eight foot from the ground , and sit still , sharpen his knife on the sole of his foot and singing to himself .
A little before mid-day , when the sun be very warm , he hear the patter of foot and smelt the abominable smell of the dhole-pack a they trot pitilessly along Won-tolla 's trail .
Seen from above , the red dhole do not look half the size of a wolf , but Mowgli know how strong his foot and jaw be .
He watch the sharp bay head of the leader snuff along the trail , and give him `` Good hunting ! ''
The brute look up , and his companion halt behind him , score and score of red dog with low-hung tail , heavy shoulder , weak quarter , and bloody mouth .
The dhole be a very silent people a a rule , and they have no manner even in their own Jungle .
Fully two hundred must have gather below him , but he could see that the leader sniff hungrily on Won-tolla 's trail , and try to drag the Pack forward .
That would never do , or they would be at the Lairs in broad daylight , and Mowgli mean to hold them under his tree till dusk .
`` By whose leave do ye come here ? ''
say Mowgli .
`` All Jungles be our Jungle , '' be the reply , and the dhole that give it bar his white teeth .
Mowgli look down with a smile , and imitate perfectly the sharp chitter-chatter of Chikai , the leap rat of the Dekkan , mean the dhole to understand that he consider them no good than Chikai .
The Pack close up round the tree-trunk and the leader bay savagely , call Mowgli a tree-ape .
For an answer Mowgli stretch down one naked leg and wriggle his bare toe just above the leader 's head .
That be enough , and more than enough , to wake the Pack to stupid rage .
Those who have hair between their toe do not care to be remind of it .
Mowgli catch his foot away a the leader leap up , and say sweetly : `` Dog , red dog !
Go back to the Dekkan and eat lizard .
Go to Chikai thy brother -- dog , dog -- red , red dog !
There be hair between every toe ! ''
He twiddle his toe a second time .
`` Come down ere we starve thee out , hairless ape ! ''
yell the Pack , and this be exactly what Mowgli want .
He lay himself down along the branch , his cheek to the bark , his right arm free , and there he tell the Pack what he think and know about them , their manner , their custom , their mate , and their puppy .
There be no speech in the world so rancorous and so stinging a the language the Jungle People use to show scorn and contempt .
When you come to think of it you will see how this must be so .
As Mowgli tell Kaa , he have many little thorn under his tongue , and slowly and deliberately he drive the dhole from silence to growl , from growl to yell , and from yell to hoarse slavery raving .
They try to answer his taunt , but a cub might as well have try to answer Kaa in a rage ; and all the while Mowgli 's right hand lay crook at his side , ready for action , his foot lock round the branch .
The big bay leader have leap many time in the air , but Mowgli dare not risk a false blow .
At last , make furious beyond his natural strength , he bound up seven or eight foot clear of the ground .
Then Mowgli 's hand shoot out like the head of a tree-snake , and grip him by the scruff of his neck , and the branch shook with the jar a his weight fell back , almost wrench Mowgli to the ground .
But he never loose his grip , and inch by inch he haul the beast , hang like a drowned jackal , up on the branch .
With his left hand he reach for his knife and cut off the red , bushy tail , fling the dhole back to earth again .
That be all he need .
The Pack would not go forward on Won-tolla 's trail now till they have kill Mowgli or Mowgli have kill them .
He saw them settle down in circle with a quiver of the haunch that mean they be go to stay , and so he climb to a high crotch , settle his back comfortably , and go to sleep .
After three or four hour he wake and count the Pack .
They be all there , silent , husky , and dry , with eye of steel .
The sun be begin to sink .
In half an hour the Little People of the Rocks would be end their labour , and , a you know , the dhole do not fight best in the twilight .
`` I do not need such faithful watcher , '' he say politely , stand up on a branch , `` but I will remember this .
Ye be true dhole , but to my thinking over much of one kind .
For that reason I do not give the big lizard-eater his tail again .
Art thou not pleased , Red Dog ? ''
`` I myself will tear out thy stomach ! ''
yell the leader , scratch at the foot of the tree .
`` Nay , but consider , wise rat of the Dekkan .
There will now be many litter of little tailless red dog , yea , with raw red stump that sting when the sand be hot .
Go home , Red Dog , and cry that an ape have do this .
Ye will not go ?
Come , then , with me , and I will make you very wise ! ''
He move , Bandar-log fashion , into the next tree , and so on into the next and the next , the Pack follow with lifted hungry head .
Now and then he would pretend to fall , and the Pack would tumble one over the other in their haste to be at the death .
It be a curious sight -- the boy with the knife that shone in the low sunlight a it sift through the upper branch , and the silent Pack with their red coat all aflame , huddle and follow below .
When he come to the last tree he take the garlic and rub himself all over carefully , and the dhole yell with scorn .
`` Ape with a wolf 's tongue , dost thou think to cover thy scent ? ''
they say .
`` We follow to the death . ''
`` Take thy tail , '' say Mowgli , fling it back along the course he have take .
The Pack instinctively rush after it .
`` And follow now -- to the death . ''
He have slip down the tree-trunk , and head like the wind in bare foot for the Bee Rocks , before the dhole saw what he would do .
They give one deep howl , and settle down to the long , lob canter that can at the last run down anything that run .
Mowgli know their pack-pace to be much slow than that of the wolf , or he would never have risk a two-mile run in full sight .
They be sure that the boy be theirs at last , and he be sure that he hold them to play with a he please .
All his trouble be to keep them sufficiently hot behind him to prevent their turning off too soon .
He run cleanly , evenly , and springily ; the tailless leader not five yard behind him ; and the Pack tail out over perhaps a quarter of a mile of ground , crazy and blind with the rage of slaughter .
So he keep his distance by ear , reserve his last effort for the rush across the Bee Rocks .
The Little People have go to sleep in the early twilight , for it be not the season of late blossoming flower ; but a Mowgli 's first foot-falls rang hollow on the hollow ground he hear a sound a though all the earth be hum .
Then he run a he have never run in his life before , spurn aside one -- two -- three of the pile of stone into the dark , sweet-smelling gully ; hear a roar like the roar of the sea in a cave ; saw with the tail of his eye the air grow dark behind him ; saw the current of the Waingunga far below , and a flat , diamond-shaped head in the water ; leap outward with all his strength , the tailless dhole snap at his shoulder in mid-air , and drop foot first to the safety of the river , breathless and triumphant .
There be not a sting upon him , for the smell of the garlic have check the Little People for just the few second that he be among them .
When he rise Kaa 's coil be steady him and thing be bound over the edge of the cliff -- great lump , it seem , of clustered bee fall like plummet ; but before any lump touch water the bee fly upward and the body of a dhole whirl down-stream .
Overhead they could hear furious short yell that be drown in a roar like breaker -- the roar of the wing of the Little People of the Rocks .
Some of the dhole , too , have fall into the gully that communicate with the underground cave , and there choke and fight and snap among the tumbled honeycomb , and at last , bear up , even when they be dead , on the heave wave of bee beneath them , shoot out of some hole in the river-face , to roll over on the black rubbish-heaps .
There be dhole who have leap short into the tree on the cliff , and the bee blot out their shape ; but the great number of them , madden by the sting , have fling themselves into the river ; and , a Kaa say , the Waingunga be hungry water .
Kaa hold Mowgli fast till the boy have recover his breath .
`` We may not stay here , '' he say .
`` The Little People be rouse indeed .
Come ! ''
Swimming low and diving as often a he could , Mowgli go down the river , knife in hand .
`` Slowly , slowly , '' say Kaa .
`` One tooth do not kill a hundred unless it be a cobra 's , and many of the dhole take water swiftly when they saw the Little People rise . ''
`` The more work for my knife , then .
Phai !
How the Little People follow ! ''
Mowgli sink again .
The face of the water be blanket with wild bee , buzz sullenly and sting all they find .
`` Nothing be ever yet lose by silence , '' say Kaa -- no sting could penetrate his scale -- `` and thou hast all the long night for the hunting .
Hear them howl ! ''
Nearly half the pack have see the trap their fellow rush into , and turn sharp aside have fling themselves into the water where the gorge break down in steep bank .
Their cry of rage and their threat against the `` tree-ape '' who have bring them to their shame mix with the yell and growl of those who have be punish by the Little People .
To remain ashore be death , and every dhole know it .
Their pack be sweep along the current , down to the deep eddy of the Peace Pool , but even there the angry Little People follow and force them to the water again .
Mowgli could hear the voice of the tailless leader bid his people hold on and kill out every wolf in Seeonee .
But he do not waste his time in listen .
`` One kill in the dark behind u ! ''
snap a dhole .
`` Here be tainted water ! ''
Mowgli have dive forward like an otter , twitch a struggle dhole under water before he could open his mouth , and dark ring rise a the body plop up , turn on it side .
The dhole try to turn , but the current prevent them , and the Little People dart at the head and ear , and they could hear the challenge of the Seeonee Pack grow louder and deeper in the gathering darkness .
Again Mowgli dive , and again a dhole go under , and rise dead , and again the clamour break out at the rear of the pack ; some howling that it be best to go ashore , others call on their leader to lead them back to the Dekkan , and others bid Mowgli show himself and be kill .
`` They come to the fight with two stomach and several voice , '' say Kaa .
`` The rest be with thy brother below yonder , The Little People go back to sleep .
They have chase u far .
Now I , too , turn back , for I be not of one skin with any wolf .
Good hunting , Little Brother , and remember the dhole bite low . ''
A wolf come run along the bank on three leg , leap up and down , lay his head sideways close to the ground , hunch his back , and break high into the air , a though he be play with his cub .
It be Won-tolla , the Outlier , and he say never a word , but continue his horrible sport beside the dhole .
They have be long in the water now , and be swim wearily , their coat drench and heavy , their bushy tail drag like sponge , so tired and shake that they , too , be silent , watch the pair of blaze eye that move abreast .
`` This be no good hunting , '' say one , pant .
`` Good hunting ! ''
say Mowgli , a he rise boldly at the brute 's side , and send the long knife home behind the shoulder , push hard to avoid his die snap .
`` Art thou there , Man-cub ? ''
say Won-tolla across the water .
`` Ask of the dead , Outlier , '' Mowgli reply .
`` Have none come down-stream ?
I have fill these dog ' mouth with dirt ; I have trick them in the broad daylight , and their leader lack his tail , but here be some few for thee still .
Whither shall I drive them ? ''
`` I will wait , '' say Won-tolla .
`` The night be before me . ''
Nearer and nearer come the bay of the Seeonee wolf .
`` For the Pack , for the Full Pack it be meet ! ''
and a bend in the river drive the dhole forward among the sand and shoal opposite the Lairs .
Then they saw their mistake .
They should have land half a mile high up , and rush the wolf on dry ground .
Now it be too late .
The bank be line with burn eye , and except for the horrible pheeal that have never stop since sundown , there be no sound in the Jungle .
It seem a though Won-tolla be fawn on them to come ashore ; and `` Turn and take hold ! ''
say the leader of the dhole .
The entire Pack flung themselves at the shore , thresh and squattering through the shoal water , till the face of the Waingunga be all white and torn , and the great ripple go from side to side , like bow-waves from a boat .
Mowgli follow the rush , stab and slice a the dhole , huddle together , rush up the river-beach in one wave .
Then the long fight begin , heave and strain and splitting and scattering and narrowing and broadening along the red , wet sand , and over and between the tangled tree-roots , and through and among the bush , and in and out of the grass clump ; for even now the dhole be two to one .
But they meet wolf fight for all that make the Pack , and not only the short , high , deep-chested , white-tusked hunter of the Pack , but the anxious-eyed lahinis -- the she-wolves of the lair , a the saying be -- fight for their litter , with here and there a yearling wolf , his first coat still half woolly , tug and grapple by their side .
A wolf , you must know , fly at the throat or snap at the flank , while a dhole , by preference , bite at the belly ; so when the dhole be struggle out of the water and have to raise their head , the odds be with the wolf .
On dry land the wolf suffer ; but in the water or ashore , Mowgli 's knife come and go without ceasing .
The Four have worry their way to his side .
Gray Brother , crouch between the boy 's knee , be protect his stomach , while the others guard his back and either side , or stand over him when the shock of a leaping , yell dhole who have throw himself full on the steady blade bore him down .
For the rest , it be one tangled confusion -- a locked and sway mob that move from right to leave and from leave to right along the bank ; and also ground round and round slowly on it own centre .
Here would be a heaving mound , like a water-blister in a whirlpool , which would break like a water-blister , and throw up four or five mangled dog , each strive to get back to the centre ; here would be a single wolf bear down by two or three dhole , laboriously drag them forward , and sink the while ; here a yearling cub would be hold up by the pressure round him , though he have be kill early , while his mother , craze with dumb rage , roll over and over , snap , and pass on ; and in the middle of the thick press , perhaps , one wolf and one dhole , forget everything else , would be manoeuvre for first hold till they be whirl away by a rush of furious fighter .
Once Mowgli pass Akela , a dhole on either flank , and his all but toothless jaw close over the loin of a third ; and once he saw Phao , his teeth set in the throat of a dhole , tug the unwilling beast forward till the yearling could finish him .
But the bulk of the fight be blind flurry and smother in the dark ; hit , trip , and tumble , yelp , groan , and worry-worry-worry , round him and behind him and above him .
As the night wore on , the quick , giddy-go-round motion increase .
The dhole be cow and afraid to attack the strong wolf , but do not yet dare to run away .
Mowgli felt that the end be come soon , and content himself with strike merely to cripple .
The yearling be grow bolder ; there be time now and again to breathe , and pass a word to a friend , and the mere flicker of the knife would sometimes turn a dog aside .
`` The meat be very near the bone , '' Gray Brother yell .
He be bleed from a score of flesh-wounds .
`` But the bone be yet to be crack , '' say Mowgli .
`` Eowawa !
THUS do we do in the Jungle ! ''
The red blade run like a flame along the side of a dhole whose hind-quarters be hide by the weight of a clinging wolf .
`` My kill ! ''
snort the wolf through his wrinkled nostril .
`` Leave him to me . ''
`` Is thy stomach still empty , Outlier ? ''
say Mowgli .
Won-tolla be fearfully punish , but his grip have paralyse the dhole , who could not turn round and reach him .
`` By the Bull that buy me , '' say Mowgli , with a bitter laugh , `` it be the tailless one ! ''
And indeed it be the big bay-coloured leader .
`` It be not wise to kill cub and lahinis , '' Mowgli go on philosophically , wipe the blood out of his eye , `` unless one have also kill the Outlier ; and it be in my stomach that this Won-tolla kill thee . ''
A dhole leap to his leader 's aid ; but before his teeth have find Won-tolla 's flank , Mowgli 's knife be in his throat , and Gray Brother take what be leave .
`` And thus do we do in the Jungle , '' say Mowgli .
Won-tolla say not a word , only his jaw be close and closing on the backbone a his life ebb .
The dhole shudder , his head drop , and he lay still , and Won-tolla drop above him .
`` Huh !
The Blood Debt be pay , '' say Mowgli .
`` Sing the song , Won-tolla . ''
`` He hunt no more , '' say Gray Brother ; `` and Akela , too , be silent this long time . ''
`` The bone be crack ! ''
thunder Phao , son of Phaona .
`` They go !
Kill , kill out , O hunter of the Free People ! ''
Dhole after dhole be slink away from those dark and bloody sand to the river , to the thick Jungle , up-stream or down-stream a he saw the road clear .
`` The debt !
The debt ! ''
shout Mowgli .
`` Pay the debt !
They have slay the Lone Wolf !
Let not a dog go ! ''
He be fly to the river , knife in hand , to check any dhole who dare to take water , when , from under a mound of nine dead , rise Akela 's head and fore-quarters , and Mowgli drop on his knee beside the Lone Wolf .
`` Said I not it would be my last fight ? ''
Akela gasp .
`` It be good hunting .
And thou , Little Brother ? ''
`` I live , have kill many . ''
`` Even so .
I die , and I would -- I would die by thee , Little Brother . ''
Mowgli take the terrible scarred head on his knee , and put his arm round the torn neck .
`` It be long since the old day of Shere Khan , and a Man-cub that roll naked in the dust . ''
`` Nay , nay , I be a wolf .
I be of one skin with the Free People , '' Mowgli cry .
`` It be no will of mine that I be a man . ''
`` Thou art a man , Little Brother , wolfling of my watching .
Thou art a man , or else the Pack have flee before the dhole .
My life I owe to thee , and to-day thou hast save the Pack even a once I save thee .
Hast thou forgotten ?
All debt be pay now .
Go to thine own people .
I tell thee again , eye of my eye , this hunting be end .
Go to thine own people . ''
`` I will never go .
I will hunt alone in the Jungle .
I have say it . ''
`` After the summer come the Rains , and after the Rains come the spring .
Go back before thou art driven . ''
`` Who will drive me ? ''
`` Mowgli will drive Mowgli .
Go back to thy people .
Go to Man . ''
`` When Mowgli drive Mowgli I will go , '' Mowgli answer .
`` There be no more to say , '' say Akela .
`` Little Brother , canst thou raise me to my foot ?
I also be a leader of the Free People . ''
Very carefully and gently Mowgli lift the body aside , and raise Akela to his foot , both arm round him , and the Lone Wolf draw a long breath , and begin the Death Song that a leader of the Pack should sing when he die .
It gather strength a he go on , lift and lifting , and ring far across the river , till it come to the last `` Good hunting ! ''
and Akela shake himself clear of Mowgli for an instant , and , leap into the air , fell backward dead upon his last and most terrible kill .
Mowgli sit with his head on his knee , careless of anything else , while the remnant of the fly dhole be be overtake and run down by the merciless lahinis .
Little by little the cry die away , and the wolf return limp , a their wound stiffen , to take stock of the loss .
Fifteen of the Pack , as well a half a dozen lahinis , lay dead by the river , and of the others not one be unmarked .
And Mowgli sit through it all till the cold daybreak , when Phao 's wet , red muzzle be drop in his hand , and Mowgli draw back to show the gaunt body of Akela .
`` Good hunting ! ''
say Phao , a though Akela be still alive , and then over his bitten shoulder to the others : `` Howl , dog !
A Wolf have die to-night ! ''
But of all the Pack of two hundred fight dhole , whose boast be that all jungle be their Jungle , and that no living thing could stand before them , not one return to the Dekkan to carry that word .
CHIL 'S SONG -LSB- This be the song that Chil sing a the kite drop down one after another to the river-bed , when the great fight be finish .
Chil be good friend with everybody , but he be a cold-blooded kind of creature at heart , because he know that almost everybody in the Jungle come to him in the long-run . -RSB-
These be my companion go forth by night -- -LRB- For Chil !
Look you , for Chil ! -RRB-
Now come I to whistle them the end of the fight .
-LRB- Chil !
Vanguards of Chil ! -RRB-
Word they give me overhead of quarry newly slay , Word I give them underfoot of buck upon the plain .
Here 's an end of every trail -- they shall not speak again !
They that call the hunting-cry -- they that follow fast -- -LRB- For Chil !
Look you , for Chil ! -RRB-
They that bid the sambhur wheel , or pin him a he pass -- -LRB- Chil !
Vanguards of Chil ! -RRB-
They that lag behind the scent -- they that run before , They that shun the level horn -- they that overbear .
Here 's an end of every trail -- they shall not follow more .
These be my companion .
Pity 't be they die !
-LRB- For Chil !
Look you , for Chil ! -RRB-
Now come I to comfort them that know them in their pride .
-LRB- Chil !
Vanguards of Chil ! -RRB-
Tattered flank and sunken eye , open mouth and red , Locked and lank and lone they lie , the dead upon their dead .
Here 's an end of every trail -- and here my host be feed .
THE SPRING RUNNING Man go to Man !
Cry the challenge through the Jungle !
He that be our Brother go away .
Hear , now , and judge , O ye People of the Jungle , -- Answer , who shall turn him -- who shall stay ?
Man go to Man !
He be weep in the Jungle : He that be our Brother sorrow sore !
Man go to Man !
-LRB- Oh , we love him in the Jungle ! -RRB-
To the Man-Trail where we may not follow more .
The second year after the great fight with Red Dog and the death of Akela , Mowgli must have be nearly seventeen year old .
He look old , for hard exercise , the best of good eating , and bath whenever he felt in the least hot or dusty , have give him strength and growth far beyond his age .
He could swing by one hand from a top branch for half an hour at a time , when he have occasion to look along the tree-roads .
He could stop a young buck in mid-gallop and throw him sideways by the head .
He could even jerk over the big , blue wild boar that live in the Marshes of the North .
The Jungle People who use to fear him for his wit fear him now for his strength , and when he move quietly on his own affair the mere whisper of his come clear the wood-paths .
And yet the look in his eye be always gentle .
Even when he fight , his eye never blaze a Bagheera 's do .
They only grow more and more interested and excite ; and that be one of the thing that Bagheera himself do not understand .
He ask Mowgli about it , and the boy laugh and say .
`` When I miss the kill I be angry .
When I must go empty for two day I be very angry .
Do not my eye talk then ? ''
`` The mouth be hungry , '' say Bagheera , `` but the eye say nothing .
Hunting , eating , or swimming , it be all one -- like a stone in wet or dry weather . ''
Mowgli look at him lazily from under his long eyelash , and , a usual , the panther 's head drop .
Bagheera know his master .
They be lie out far up the side of a hill overlook the Waingunga , and the morning mist hang below them in band of white and green .
As the sun rise it change into bubble sea of red gold , churn off , and let the low ray stripe the dried grass on which Mowgli and Bagheera be rest .
It be the end of the cold weather , the leaf and the tree look worn and fade , and there be a dry , tick rustle everywhere when the wind blew .
A little leaf tap-tap-tapped furiously against a twig , a a single leaf caught in a current will .
It rouse Bagheera , for he snuff the morning air with a deep , hollow cough , throw himself on his back , and strike with his fore-paws at the nod leaf above .
`` The year turn , '' he say .
`` The Jungle go forward .
The Time of New Talk be near .
That leaf know .
It be very good . ''
`` The grass be dry , '' Mowgli answer , pull up a tuft .
`` Even Eye-of-the-Spring -LSB- that be a little trumpet-shaped , waxy red flower that run in and out among the grass -RSB- -- even Eye-of-the Spring be shut , and ... Bagheera , IS it well for the Black Panther so to lie on his back and beat with his paw in the air , a though he be the tree-cat ? ''
`` Aowh ? ''
say Bagheera .
He seem to be think of other thing .
`` I say , IS it well for the Black Panther so to mouth and cough , and howl and roll ?
Remember , we be the Masters of the Jungle , thou and I. '' `` Indeed , yes ; I hear , Man-cub . ''
Bagheera roll over hurriedly and sit up , the dust on his ragged black flank .
-LRB- He be just cast his winter coat . -RRB-
`` We be surely the Masters of the Jungle !
Who be so strong a Mowgli ?
Who so wise ? ''
There be a curious drawl in the voice that make Mowgli turn to see whether by any chance the Black Panther be make fun of him , for the Jungle be full of word that sound like one thing , but mean another .
`` I say we be beyond question the Masters of the Jungle , '' Bagheera repeat .
`` Have I do wrong ?
I do not know that the Man-cub no longer lay upon the ground .
