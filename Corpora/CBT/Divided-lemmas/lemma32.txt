`` Do you s ` pose Anne will ever get marry now ? ''
speculate Davy anxiously .
`` When Dorcas Sloane get marry last summer she say if she 'd have enough money to live on she 'd never have be bother with a man , but even a widower with eight child be well 'n live with a sister-in-law . ''
`` Davy Keith , do hold your tongue , '' say Mrs. Rachel severely .
`` The way you talk be scandalous for a small boy , that 's what . ''
Chapter XIX An Interlude `` To think that this be my twentieth birthday , and that I 've leave my teen behind me forever , '' say Anne , who be curl up on the hearth-rug with Rusty in her lap , to Aunt Jamesina who be read in her pet chair .
They be alone in the living room .
Stella and Priscilla have go to a committee meeting and Phil be upstairs adorn herself for a party .
`` I suppose you feel kind of , sorry '' say Aunt Jamesina .
`` The teen be such a nice part of life .
I 'm glad I 've never go out of them myself . ''
Anne laugh .
`` You never will , Aunty .
You 'll be eighteen when you should be a hundred .
Yes , I 'm sorry , and a little dissatisfied a well .
Miss Stacy tell me long ago that by the time I be twenty my character would be form , for good or evil .
I do n't feel that it 's what it should be .
It 's full of flaw . ''
`` So 's everybody 's , '' say Aunt Jamesina cheerfully .
`` Mine 's crack in a hundred place .
Your Miss Stacy likely meant that when you be twenty your character would have get it permanent bent in one direction or ` tother , and would go on develop in that line .
Do n't worry over it , Anne .
Do your duty by God and your neighbor and yourself , and have a good time .
That 's my philosophy and it 's always work pretty well .
Where 's Phil off to tonight ? ''
`` She 's go to a dance , and she 's get the sweet dress for it -- creamy yellow silk and cobwebby lace .
It just suit those brown tint of hers . ''
`` There 's magic in the word ` silk ' and ` lace , ' be n't there ? ''
say Aunt Jamesina .
`` The very sound of them make me feel like skip off to a dance .
And YELLOW silk .
It make one think of a dress of sunshine .
I always want a yellow silk dress , but first my mother and then my husband would n't hear of it .
The very first thing I 'm go to do when I get to heaven be to get a yellow silk dress . ''
Amid Anne 's peal of laughter Phil come downstairs , trail cloud of glory , and survey herself in the long oval mirror on the wall .
`` A flattering look glass be a promoter of amiability , '' she say .
`` The one in my room do certainly make me green .
Do I look pretty nice , Anne ? ''
`` Do you really know how pretty you be , Phil ? ''
ask Anne , in honest admiration .
`` Of course I do .
What be look glass and men for ?
That be n't what I mean .
Are all my end tuck in ?
Is my skirt straight ?
And would this rise look well low down ?
I 'm afraid it 's too high -- it will make me look lop-sided .
But I hate thing tickle my ear . ''
`` Everything be just right , and that southwest dimple of yours be lovely . ''
`` Anne , there 's one thing in particular I like about you -- you 're so ungrudging .
There be n't a particle of envy in you . ''
`` Why should she be envious ? ''
demanded Aunt Jamesina .
`` She 's not quite as goodlooking a you , maybe , but she 's get a far handsome nose . ''
`` I know it , '' concede Phil .
`` My nose always have be a great comfort to me , '' confess Anne .
`` And I love the way your hair grows on your forehead , Anne .
And that one wee curl , always look a if it be go to drop , but never dropping , be delicious .
But a for nose , mine be a dreadful worry to me .
I know by the time I 'm forty it will be Byrney .
What do you think I 'll look like when I 'm forty , Anne ? ''
`` Like an old , matronly , marry woman , '' tease Anne .
`` I wo n't , '' say Phil , sit down comfortably to wait for her escort .
`` Joseph , you calico beastie , do n't you dare jump on my lap .
I wo n't go to a dance all over cat hair .
No , Anne , I WO N'T look matronly .
But no doubt I 'll be marry . ''
`` To Alec or Alonzo ? ''
ask Anne .
`` To one of them , I suppose , '' sigh Phil , `` if I can ever decide which . ''
`` It should n't be hard to decide , '' scold Aunt Jamesina .
`` I be bear a see-saw Aunty , and nothing can ever prevent me from teeter . ''
`` You ought to be more levelheaded , Philippa . ''
`` It 's best to be levelheaded , of course , '' agree Philippa , `` but you miss lot of fun .
As for Alec and Alonzo , if you know them you 'd understand why it 's difficult to choose between them .
They 're equally nice . ''
`` Then take somebody who be nicer '' suggest Aunt Jamesina .
`` There 's that Senior who be so devoted to you -- Will Leslie .
He have such nice , large , mild eye . ''
`` They 're a little bit too large and too mild -- like a cow 's , '' say Phil cruelly .
`` What do you say about George Parker ? ''
`` There 's nothing to say about him except that he always look a if he have just be starch and iron . ''
`` Marr Holworthy then .
You ca n't find a fault with him . ''
`` No , he would do if he be n't poor .
I must marry a rich man , Aunt Jamesina .
That -- and good look -- be an indispensable qualification .
I 'd marry Gilbert Blythe if he be rich . ''
`` Oh , would you ? ''
say Anne , rather viciously .
`` We do n't like that idea a little bit , although we do n't want Gilbert ourselves , oh , no , '' mock Phil .
`` But do n't let 's talk of disagreeable subject .
I 'll have to marry sometime , I suppose , but I shall put off the evil day as long a I can . ''
`` You must n't marry anybody you do n't love , Phil , when all 's say and do , '' say Aunt Jamesina . ''
` Oh , hearts that love in the good old way Have be out o ' the fashion this many a day . ' ''
trill Phil mockingly .
`` There 's the carriage .
I fly -- Bi-bi , you two old-fashioned darling . ''
When Phil have go Aunt Jamesina look solemnly at Anne .
`` That girl be pretty and sweet and goodhearted , but do you think she be quite right in her mind , by spell , Anne ? ''
`` Oh , I do n't think there 's anything the matter with Phil 's mind , '' say Anne , hide a smile .
`` It 's just her way of talk . ''
Aunt Jamesina shake her head .
`` Well , I hope so , Anne .
I do hope so , because I love her .
But I ca n't understand her -- she beat me .
She be n't like any of the girl I ever know , or any of the girl I be myself . ''
`` How many girl be you , Aunt Jimsie ? ''
`` About half a dozen , my dear . ''
Chapter XX Gilbert Speaks `` This have be a dull , prosy day , '' yawn Phil , stretch herself idly on the sofa , have previously dispossess two exceedingly indignant cat .
Anne look up from Pickwick Papers .
Now that spring examination be over she be treat herself to Dickens .
`` It have be a prosy day for u , '' she say thoughtfully , `` but to some people it have be a wonderful day .
Some one have be rapturously happy in it .
Perhaps a great deed have be do somewhere today -- or a great poem write -- or a great man bear .
And some heart have be break , Phil . ''
`` Why do you spoil your pretty think by tag that last sentence on , honey ? ''
grumble Phil .
`` I do n't like to think of broken heart -- or anything unpleasant . ''
`` Do you think you 'll be able to shirk unpleasant thing all your life , Phil ? ''
`` Dear me , no .
Am I not up against them now ?
You do n't call Alec and Alonzo pleasant thing , do you , when they simply plague my life out ? ''
`` You never take anything seriously , Phil . ''
`` Why should I ?
There be enough folk who do .
The world need people like me , Anne , just to amuse it .
It would be a terrible place if EVERYBODY be intellectual and serious and in deep , deadly earnest .
MY mission be , a Josiah Allen say , ` to charm and allure . '
Confess now .
Has n't life at Patty 's Place be really much brighter and pleasanter this past winter because I 've be here to leaven you ? ''
`` Yes , it have , '' own Anne .
`` And you all love me -- even Aunt Jamesina , who think I 'm stark mad .
So why should I try to be different ?
Oh , dear , I 'm so sleepy .
I be awake until one last night , read a harrow ghost story .
I read it in bed , and after I have finish it do you suppose I could get out of bed to put the light out ?
No !
And if Stella have not fortunately come in late that lamp would have burn good and bright till morning .
When I hear Stella I call her in , explain my predicament , and get her to put out the light .
If I have get out myself to do it I know something would grab me by the foot when I be get in again .
By the way , Anne , have Aunt Jamesina decide what to do this summer ? ''
`` Yes , she 's go to stay here .
I know she 's do it for the sake of those bless cat , although she say it 's too much trouble to open her own house , and she hat visit . ''
`` What be you read ? ''
`` Pickwick . ''
`` That 's a book that always make me hungry , '' say Phil .
`` There 's so much good eating in it .
The character seem always to be revel on ham and egg and milk punch .
I generally go on a cupboard rummage after read Pickwick .
The mere thought remind me that I 'm starve .
Is there any tidbit in the pantry , Queen Anne ? ''
`` I make a lemon pie this morning .
You may have a piece of it . ''
Phil dash out to the pantry and Anne betook herself to the orchard in company with Rusty .
It be a moist , pleasantly-odorous night in early spring .
The snow be not quite all go from the park ; a little dingy bank of it yet lay under the pine of the harbor road , screen from the influence of April sun .
It keep the harbor road muddy , and chill the evening air .
But grass be grow green in sheltered spot and Gilbert have find some pale , sweet arbutus in a hidden corner .
He come up from the park , his hand full of it .
Anne be sit on the big gray boulder in the orchard look at the poem of a bare , birchen bough hang against the pale red sunset with the very perfection of grace .
She be build a castle in air -- a wondrous mansion whose sunlit court and stately hall be steep in Araby 's perfume , and where she reign queen and chatelaine .
She frown a she saw Gilbert come through the orchard .
Of late she have manage not to be leave alone with Gilbert .
But he have catch her fairly now ; and even Rusty have desert her .
Gilbert sit down beside her on the boulder and hold out his Mayflowers .
`` Do n't these remind you of home and our old schoolday picnic , Anne ? ''
Anne take them and bury her face in them .
`` I 'm in Mr. Silas Sloane 's barren this very minute , '' she say rapturously .
`` I suppose you will be there in reality in a few day ? ''
`` No , not for a fortnight .
I 'm go to visit with Phil in Bolingbroke before I go home .
You 'll be in Avonlea before I will . ''
`` No , I shall not be in Avonlea at all this summer , Anne .
I 've be offer a job in the Daily News office and I 'm go to take it . ''
`` Oh , '' say Anne vaguely .
She wonder what a whole Avonlea summer would be like without Gilbert .
Somehow she do not like the prospect .
`` Well , '' she conclude flatly , `` it be a good thing for you , of course . ''
`` Yes , I 've be hop I would get it .
It will help me out next year . ''
`` You must n't work too HARD , '' say Anne , without any very clear idea of what she be say .
She wish desperately that Phil would come out .
`` You 've study very constantly this winter .
Is n't this a delightful evening ?
Do you know , I find a cluster of white violet under that old twisted tree over there today ?
I felt a if I have discover a gold mine . ''
`` You be always discover gold mine , '' say Gilbert -- also absently .
`` Let u go and see if we can find some more , '' suggest Anne eagerly .
`` I 'll call Phil and -- '' `` Never mind Phil and the violet just now , Anne , '' say Gilbert quietly , take her hand in a clasp from which she could not free it .
`` There be something I want to say to you . ''
`` Oh , do n't say it , '' cry Anne , pleadingly .
`` Do n't -- PLEASE , Gilbert . ''
`` I must .
Things ca n't go on like this any long .
Anne , I love you .
You know I do .
I -- I ca n't tell you how much .
Will you promise me that some day you 'll be my wife ? ''
`` I -- I ca n't , '' say Anne miserably .
`` Oh , Gilbert -- you -- you 've spoil everything . ''
`` Do n't you care for me at all ? ''
Gilbert ask after a very dreadful pause , during which Anne have not dare to look up .
`` Not -- not in that way .
I do care a great deal for you a a friend .
But I do n't love you , Gilbert . ''
`` But ca n't you give me some hope that you will -- yet ? ''
`` No , I ca n't , '' exclaim Anne desperately .
`` I never , never can love you -- in that way -- Gilbert .
You must never speak of this to me again . ''
There be another pause -- so long and so dreadful that Anne be drive at last to look up .
Gilbert 's face be white to the lip .
And his eye -- but Anne shudder and look away .
There be nothing romantic about this .
Must proposal be either grotesque or -- horrible ?
Could she ever forget Gilbert 's face ?
`` Is there anybody else ? ''
he ask at last in a low voice .
`` No -- no , '' say Anne eagerly .
`` I do n't care for any one like THAT -- and I LIKE you good than anybody else in the world , Gilbert .
And we must -- we must go on be friend , Gilbert . ''
Gilbert give a bitter little laugh .
`` Friends !
Your friendship ca n't satisfy me , Anne .
I want your love -- and you tell me I can never have that . ''
`` I 'm sorry .
Forgive me , Gilbert , '' be all Anne could say .
Where , oh , where be all the gracious and graceful speech wherewith , in imagination , she have be wont to dismiss reject suitor ?
Gilbert release her hand gently .
`` There be n't anything to forgive .
There have be time when I think you do care .
I 've deceive myself , that 's all .
Goodbye , Anne . ''
Anne get herself to her room , sit down on her window seat behind the pine , and cry bitterly .
She felt a if something incalculably precious have go out of her life .
It be Gilbert 's friendship , of course .
Oh , why must she lose it after this fashion ?
`` What be the matter , honey ? ''
ask Phil , come in through the moonlit gloom .
Anne do not answer .
At that moment she wish Phil be a thousand mile away .
`` I suppose you 've go and refuse Gilbert Blythe .
You be an idiot , Anne Shirley ! ''
`` Do you call it idiotic to refuse to marry a man I do n't love ? ''
say Anne coldly , goad to reply .
`` You do n't know love when you see it .
You 've trick something out with your imagination that you think love , and you expect the real thing to look like that .
There , that 's the first sensible thing I 've ever say in my life .
I wonder how I manage it ? ''
`` Phil , '' plead Anne , `` please go away and leave me alone for a little while .
My world have tumble into piece .
I want to reconstruct it . ''
`` Without any Gilbert in it ? ''
say Phil , go .
A world without any Gilbert in it !
Anne repeat the word drearily .
Would it not be a very lonely , forlorn place ?
Well , it be all Gilbert 's fault .
He have spoil their beautiful comradeship .
She must just learn to live without it .
Chapter XXI Roses of Yesterday The fortnight Anne spent in Bolingbroke be a very pleasant one , with a little under current of vague pain and dissatisfaction run through it whenever she think about Gilbert .
There be not , however , much time to think about him .
`` Mount Holly , '' the beautiful old Gordon homestead , be a very gay place , overrun by Phil 's friend of both sex .
There be quite a bewildering succession of drive , dance , picnic and boat party , all expressively lump together by Phil under the head of `` jamboree '' ; Alec and Alonzo be so constantly on hand that Anne wonder if they ever do anything but dance attendance on that will-o ' - the-wisp of a Phil .
They be both nice , manly fellows , but Anne would not be draw into any opinion a to which be the nicer .
`` And I depend so on you to help me make up my mind which of them I should promise to marry , '' mourn Phil .
`` You must do that for yourself .
You be quite expert at make up your mind a to whom other people should marry , '' retort Anne , rather caustically .
`` Oh , that 's a very different thing , '' say Phil , truly .
But the sweet incident of Anne 's sojourn in Bolingbroke be the visit to her birthplace -- the little shabby yellow house in an out-of-the-way street she have so often dream about .
She look at it with delighted eye , a she and Phil turn in at the gate .
`` It 's almost exactly a I 've picture it , '' she say .
`` There be no honeysuckle over the window , but there be a lilac tree by the gate , and -- yes , there be the muslin curtain in the window .
How glad I be it be still paint yellow . ''
A very tall , very thin woman open the door .
`` Yes , the Shirleys live here twenty year ago , '' she say , in answer to Anne 's question .
`` They have it rent .
I remember 'em .
They both die of fever at onct .
It be turrible sad .
They leave a baby .
I guess it 's dead long ago .
It be a sickly thing .
Old Thomas and his wife take it -- a if they have n't enough of their own . ''
`` It do n't die , '' say Anne , smile .
`` I be that baby . ''
`` You do n't say so !
Why , you have grow , '' exclaim the woman , a if she be much surprise that Anne be not still a baby .
`` Come to look at you , I see the resemblance .
You 're complect like your pa .
He have red hair .
But you favor your ma in your eye and mouth .
She be a nice little thing .
My darter go to school to her and be nigh crazy about her .
They be bury in the one grave and the School Board put up a tombstone to them a a reward for faithful service .
Will you come in ? ''
`` Will you let me go all over the house ? ''
ask Anne eagerly .
`` Laws , yes , you can if you like .
` Two n't take you long -- there ai n't much of it .
I keep at my man to build a new kitchen , but he ai n't one of your hustler .
The parlor 's in there and there 's two room upstairs .
Just prowl about yourselves .
I 've get to see to the baby .
The east room be the one you be bear in .
I remember your ma say she love to see the sunrise ; and I mind hear that you be bear just a the sun be rise and it light on your face be the first thing your ma saw . ''
Anne go up the narrow stair and into that little east room with a full heart .
It be a a shrine to her .
Here her mother have dream the exquisite , happy dream of anticipated motherhood ; here that red sunrise light have fall over them both in the sacred hour of birth ; here her mother have die .
Anne look about her reverently , her eye with tear .
It be for her one of the jeweled hour of life that gleam out radiantly forever in memory .
`` Just to think of it -- mother be young than I be now when I be bear , '' she whisper .
When Anne go downstairs the lady of the house meet her in the hall .
She hold out a dusty little packet tie with faded blue ribbon .
`` Here 's a bundle of old letter I find in that closet upstairs when I come here , '' she say .
`` I dunno what they be -- I never bother to look in 'em , but the address on the top one be ` Miss Bertha Willis , ' and that be your ma 's maiden name .
You can take 'em if you 'd keer to have 'em . ''
`` Oh , thank you -- thank you , '' cry Anne , clasp the packet rapturously .
`` That be all that be in the house , '' say her hostess .
`` The furniture be all sell to pay the doctor bill , and Mrs. Thomas get your ma 's clothes and little thing .
I reckon they do n't last long among that drove of Thomas youngster .
They be destructive young animal , a I mind 'em . ''
`` I have n't one thing that belong to my mother , '' say Anne , chokily .
`` I -- I can never thank you enough for these letter . ''
`` You 're quite welcome .
Laws , but your eye be like your ma 's .
She could just about talk with hers .
Your father be sorter homely but awful nice .
I mind hear folk say when they be marry that there never be two people more in love with each other -- Pore creature , they do n't live much longer ; but they be awful happy while they be alive , and I s ` pose that count for a good deal . ''
Anne long to get home to read her precious letter ; but she make one little pilgrimage first .
She go alone to the green corner of the `` old '' Bolingbroke cemetery where her father and mother be bury , and leave on their grave the white flower she carry .
Then she hasten back to Mount Holly , shut herself up in her room , and read the letter .
Some be write by her father , some by her mother .
There be not many -- only a dozen in all -- for Walter and Bertha Shirley have not be often separate during their courtship .
The letter be yellow and fade and dim , blur with the touch of pass year .
No profound word of wisdom be trace on the stain and wrinkle page , but only line of love and trust .
The sweetness of forgotten thing clung to them -- the far-off , fond imaginings of those long-dead lover .
Bertha Shirley have possess the gift of write letter which embody the charming personality of the writer in word and thought that retain their beauty and fragrance after the lapse of time .
The letter be tender , intimate , sacred .
To Anne , the sweet of all be the one write after her birth to the father on a brief absence .
It be full of a proud young mother 's account of `` baby '' -- her cleverness , her brightness , her thousand sweetness .
`` I love her best when she be asleep and good still when she be awake , '' Bertha Shirley have write in the postscript .
Probably it be the last sentence she have ever pen .
The end be very near for her .
`` This have be the most beautiful day of my life , '' Anne say to Phil that night .
`` I 've FOUND my father and mother .
Those letter have make them REAL to me .
I 'm not an orphan any longer .
I feel a if I have open a book and found rose of yesterday , sweet and beloved , between it leaf . ''
Chapter XXII Spring and Anne Return to Green Gables The firelight shadow be dance over the kitchen wall at Green Gables , for the spring evening be chilly ; through the open east window drift in the subtly sweet voice of the night .
Marilla be sit by the fire -- at least , in body .
In spirit she be roam olden way , with foot grown young .
Of late Marilla have thus spend many an hour , when she think she should have be knit for the twin .
`` I suppose I 'm grow old , '' she say .
Yet Marilla have change but little in the past nine year , save to grow something thinner , and even more angular ; there be a little more gray in the hair that be still twist up in the same hard knot , with two hairpin -- WERE they the same hairpin ?
-- still stick through it .
But her expression be very different ; the something about the mouth which have hint at a sense of humor have develop wonderfully ; her eye be gentle and milder , her smile more frequent and tender .
Marilla be think of her whole past life , her cramped but not unhappy childhood , the jealously hidden dream and the blighted hope of her girlhood , the long , gray , narrow , monotonous year of dull middle life that follow .
And the come of Anne -- the vivid , imaginative , impetuous child with her heart of love , and her world of fancy , bring with her color and warmth and radiance , until the wilderness of existence have blossom like the rise .
Marilla felt that out of her sixty year she have live only the nine that have follow the advent of Anne .
And Anne would be home tomorrow night .
The kitchen door open .
Marilla look up expect to see Mrs. Lynde .
Anne stand before her , tall and starry-eyed , with her hand full of Mayflowers and violet .
`` Anne Shirley ! ''
exclaim Marilla .
For once in her life she be surprise out of her reserve ; she catch her girl in her arm and crush her and her flower against her heart , kiss the bright hair and sweet face warmly .
`` I never look for you till tomorrow night .
How do you get from Carmody ? ''
`` Walked , dear of Marillas .
Have n't I do it a score of time in the Queen 's day ?
The mailman be to bring my trunk tomorrow ; I just get homesick all at once , and come a day earlier .
And oh !
I 've have such a lovely walk in the May twilight ; I stop by the barren and pick these Mayflowers ; I come through Violet-Vale ; it 's just a big bowlful of violet now -- the dear , sky-tinted thing .
Smell them , Marilla -- drink them in . ''
Marilla sniff obligingly , but she be more interested in Anne than in drink violet .
`` Sit down , child .
You must be real tire .
I 'm go to get you some supper . ''
`` There 's a darling moonrise behind the hill tonight , Marilla , and oh , how the frog sing me home from Carmody !
I do love the music of the frog .
It seem bind up with all my happy recollection of old spring evening .
And it always remind me of the night I come here first .
Do you remember it , Marilla ? ''
`` Well , yes , '' say Marilla with emphasis .
`` I 'm not likely to forget it ever . ''
`` They use to sing so madly in the marsh and brook that year .
I would listen to them at my window in the dusk , and wonder how they could seem so glad and so sad at the same time .
Oh , but it 's good to be home again !
Redmond be splendid and Bolingbroke delightful -- but Green Gables be HOME . ''
`` Gilbert be n't come home this summer , I hear , '' say Marilla .
`` No . ''
Something in Anne 's tone make Marilla glance at her sharply , but Anne be apparently absorb in arrange her violet in a bowl .
`` See , be n't they sweet ? ''
she go on hurriedly .
`` The year be a book , be n't it , Marilla ?
Spring 's page be write in Mayflowers and violet , summer 's in rose , autumn 's in red maple leaf , and winter in holly and evergreen . ''
`` Did Gilbert do well in his examination ? ''
persist Marilla .
`` Excellently well .
He lead his class .
But where be the twin and Mrs. Lynde ? ''
`` Rachel and Dora be over at Mr. Harrison 's .
Davy be down at Boulters ' .
I think I hear him come now . ''
Davy burst in , saw Anne , stop , and then hurl himself upon her with a joyful yell .
`` Oh , Anne , ai n't I glad to see you !
Say , Anne , I 've grow two inch since last fall .
Mrs. Lynde measure me with her tape today , and say , Anne , see my front tooth .
It 's go .
Mrs. Lynde tie one end of a string to it and the other end to the door , and then shut the door .
I sell it to Milty for two cent .
Milty 's collect teeth . ''
`` What in the world do he want teeth for ? ''
ask Marilla .
`` To make a necklace for play Indian Chief , '' explain Davy , climb upon Anne 's lap .
`` He 's get fifteen already , and everybody 's else 's promise , so there 's no use in the rest of u start to collect , too .
I tell you the Boulters be great business people . ''
`` Were you a good boy at Mrs. Boulter 's ? ''
ask Marilla severely .
`` Yes ; but say , Marilla , I 'm tired of be good . ''
`` You 'd get tire of be bad much sooner , Davy-boy , '' say Anne .
`` Well , it 'd be fun while it last , would n't it ? ''
persist Davy .
`` I could be sorry for it afterwards , could n't I ? ''
`` Being sorry would n't do away with the consequence of be bad , Davy .
Do n't you remember the Sunday last summer when you run away from Sunday School ?
You tell me then that be bad be n't worth while .
What be you and Milty do today ? ''
`` Oh , we fish and chase the cat , and hunt for egg , and yell at the echo .
There 's a great echo in the bush behind the Boulter barn .
Say , what be echo , Anne ; I want to know . ''
`` Echo be a beautiful nymph , Davy , live far away in the wood , and laugh at the world from among the hill . ''
`` What do she look like ? ''
`` Her hair and eye be dark , but her neck and arm be white a snow .
No mortal can ever see how fair she be .
She be fleet than a deer , and that mock voice of hers be all we can know of her .
You can hear her call at night ; you can hear her laugh under the star .
But you can never see her .
She fly afar if you follow her , and laugh at you always just over the next hill . ''
`` Is that true , Anne ?
Or be it a whopper ? ''
demand Davy staring .
`` Davy , '' say Anne despairingly , `` have n't you sense enough to distinguish between a fairytale and a falsehood ? ''
`` Then what be it that sass back from the Boulter bush ?
I want to know , '' insist Davy .
`` When you be a little old , Davy , I 'll explain it all to you . ''
The mention of age evidently give a new turn to Davy 's thought for after a few moment of reflection , he whisper solemnly : `` Anne , I 'm go to be marry . ''
`` When ? ''
ask Anne with equal solemnity .
`` Oh , not until I 'm grown-up , of course . ''
`` Well , that 's a relief , Davy .
Who be the lady ? ''
`` Stella Fletcher ; she 's in my class at school .
And say , Anne , she 's the pretty girl you ever saw .
If I die before I grow up you 'll keep an eye on her , wo n't you ? ''
`` Davy Keith , do stop talk such nonsense , '' say Marilla severely . ''
'T be n't nonsense , '' protest Davy in an injured tone .
`` She 's my promised wife , and if I be to die she 'd be my promised widow , would n't she ?
And she have n't get a soul to look after her except her old grandmother . ''
`` Come and have your supper , Anne , '' say Marilla , `` and do n't encourage that child in his absurd talk . ''
Chapter XXIII Paul Can not Find the Rock People Life be very pleasant in Avonlea that summer , although Anne , amid all her vacation joy , be haunt by a sense of `` something go which should be there . ''
She would not admit , even in her inmost reflection , that this be cause by Gilbert 's absence .
But when she have to walk home alone from prayer meeting and A.V.I.S . pow-wows , while Diana and Fred , and many other gay couple , loiter along the dusky , starlit country road , there be a queer , lonely ache in her heart which she could not explain away .
Gilbert do not even write to her , a she think he might have do .
She know he write to Diana occasionally , but she would not inquire about him ; and Diana , suppose that Anne hear from him , volunteer no information .
Gilbert 's mother , who be a gay , frank , light-hearted lady , but not overburden with tact , have a very embarrassing habit of ask Anne , always in a painfully distinct voice and always in the presence of a crowd , if she have hear from Gilbert lately .
Poor Anne could only blush horribly and murmur , `` not very lately , '' which be take by all , Mrs. Blythe include , to be merely a maidenly evasion .
Apart from this , Anne enjoy her summer .
Priscilla come for a merry visit in June ; and , when she have go , Mr. and Mrs. Irving , Paul and Charlotta the Fourth come `` home '' for July and August .
Echo Lodge be the scene of gaiety once more , and the echo over the river be keep busy mimic the laughter that ring in the old garden behind the spruce .
`` Miss Lavendar '' have not change , except to grow even sweet and pretty .
Paul adore her , and the companionship between them be beautiful to see .
`` But I do n't call her ` mother ' just by itself , '' he explain to Anne .
`` You see , THAT name belong just to my own little mother , and I ca n't give it to any one else .
You know , teacher .
But I call her ` Mother Lavendar ' and I love her next best to father .
I -- I even love her a LITTLE good than you , teacher . ''
`` Which be just a it ought to be , '' answer Anne .
Paul be thirteen now and very tall for his year .
His face and eye be as beautiful a ever , and his fancy be still like a prism , separate everything that fell upon it into rainbow .
He and Anne have delightful ramble to wood and field and shore .
Never be there two more thoroughly `` kindred spirit . ''
Charlotta the Fourth have blossom out into young ladyhood .
She wear her hair now in an enormous pompador and have discard the blue ribbon bow of auld lang syne , but her face be a freckled , her nose a snubbed , and her mouth and smile as wide a ever .
`` You do n't think I talk with a Yankee accent , do you , Miss Shirley , ma'am ? ''
she demand anxiously .
`` I do n't notice it , Charlotta . ''
`` I 'm real glad of that .
They say I do at home , but I think likely they just want to aggravate me .
I do n't want no Yankee accent .
Not that I 've a word to say against the Yankees , Miss Shirley , ma'am .
They 're real civilized .
But give me old P.E . Island every time . ''
Paul spend his first fortnight with his grandmother Irving in Avonlea .
Anne be there to meet him when he come , and find him wild with eagerness to get to the shore -- Nora and the Golden Lady and the Twin Sailors would be there .
He could hardly wait to eat his supper .
Could he not see Nora 's elfin face peer around the point , watch for him wistfully ?
But it be a very sober Paul who come back from the shore in the twilight .
`` Did n't you find your Rock People ? ''
ask Anne .
Paul shake his chestnut curl sorrowfully .
`` The Twin Sailors and the Golden Lady never come at all , '' he say .
`` Nora be there -- but Nora be not the same , teacher .
She be change . ''
`` Oh , Paul , it be you who be change , '' say Anne .
`` You have grow too old for the Rock People .
They like only child for playfellow .
I be afraid the Twin Sailors will never again come to you in the pearly , enchant boat with the sail of moonshine ; and the Golden Lady will play no more for you on her golden harp .
Even Nora will not meet you much longer .
You must pay the penalty of growing-up , Paul .
You must leave fairyland behind you . ''
`` You two talk a much foolishness a ever you do , '' say old Mrs. Irving , half-indulgently , half-reprovingly .
`` Oh , no , we do n't , '' say Anne , shake her head gravely .
`` We be get very , very wise , and it be such a pity .
We be never half so interesting when we have learn that language be give u to enable u to conceal our thought . ''
`` But it be n't -- it be give u to exchange our thought , '' say Mrs. Irving seriously .
She have never hear of Tallyrand and do not understand epigram .
Anne spend a fortnight of halcyon day at Echo Lodge in the golden prime of August .
While there she incidentally contrive to hurry Ludovic Speed in his leisurely courting of Theodora Dix , a related duly in another chronicle of her history .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- Arnold Sherman , an elderly friend of the Irvings , be there at the same time , and add not a little to the general pleasantness of life .

`` What a nice play-time this have be , '' say Anne .
`` I feel like a giant refreshed .
And it 's only a fortnight more till I go back to Kingsport , and Redmond and Patty 's Place .
Patty 's Place be the dear spot , Miss Lavendar .
I feel a if I have two home -- one at Green Gables and one at Patty 's Place .
But where have the summer go ?
It do n't seem a day since I come home that spring evening with the Mayflowers .
When I be little I could n't see from one end of the summer to the other .
It stretch before me like an unending season .
Now , '' tis a handbreadth , 't be a tale . ' ''
`` Anne , be you and Gilbert Blythe a good friend a you use to be ? ''
ask Miss Lavendar quietly .
`` I be just as much Gilbert 's friend a ever I be , Miss Lavendar . ''
Miss Lavendar shake her head .
`` I see something 's go wrong , Anne .
I 'm go to be impertinent and ask what .
Have you quarrel ? ''
`` No ; it 's only that Gilbert want more than friendship and I ca n't give him more . ''
`` Are you sure of that , Anne ? ''
`` Perfectly sure . ''
`` I 'm very , very sorry . ''
`` I wonder why everybody seem to think I ought to marry Gilbert Blythe , '' say Anne petulantly .
`` Because you be make and mean for each other , Anne -- that be why .
You need n't toss that young head of yours .
It 's a fact . ''
Chapter XXIV Enter Jonas `` PROSPECT POINT , `` August 20th .
`` Dear Anne -- spell -- with -- an -- E , '' write Phil , `` I must prop my eyelid open long enough to write you .
I 've neglect you shamefully this summer , honey , but all my other correspondent have be neglect , too .
I have a huge pile of letter to answer , so I must gird up the loin of my mind and hoe in .
Excuse my mixed metaphor .
I 'm fearfully sleepy .
Last night Cousin Emily and I be call at a neighbor 's .
There be several other caller there , and as soon a those unfortunate creature leave , our hostess and her three daughter pick them all to piece .
I know they would begin on Cousin Emily and me as soon a the door shut behind u .
When we come home Mrs. Lilly inform u that the aforesaid neighbor 's hired boy be suppose to be down with scarlet fever .
You can always trust Mrs. Lilly to tell you cheerful thing like that .
I have a horror of scarlet fever .
I could n't sleep when I go to bed for thinking of it .
I toss and tumble about , dream fearful dream when I do snooze for a minute ; and at three I waken up with a high fever , a sore throat , and a raging headache .
I know I have scarlet fever ; I get up in a panic and hunt up Cousin Emily 's ` doctor book ' to read up the symptom .
Anne , I have them all .
So I go back to bed , and know the bad , sleep like a top the rest of the night .
Though why a top should sleep sound than anything else I never could understand .
But this morning I be quite well , so it could n't have be the fever .
I suppose if I do catch it last night it could n't have develop so soon .
I can remember that in daytime , but at three o'clock at night I never can be logical .
`` I suppose you wonder what I 'm do at Prospect Point .
Well , I always like to spend a month of summer at the shore , and father insists that I come to his second-cousin Emily 's ` select boardinghouse ' at Prospect Point .
So a fortnight ago I come as usual .
And a usual old ` Uncle Mark Miller ' bring me from the station with his ancient buggy and what he call his ` generous purpose ' horse .
He be a nice old man and give me a handful of pink peppermint .
Peppermints always seem to me such a religious sort of candy -- I suppose because when I be a little girl Grandmother Gordon always give them to me in church .
Once I ask , refer to the smell of peppermint , ` Is that the odor of sanctity ? '
I do n't like to eat Uncle Mark 's peppermint because he just fish them loose out of his pocket , and have to pick some rusty nail and other thing from among them before he give them to me .
But I would n't hurt his dear old feeling for anything , so I carefully sow them along the road at interval .
When the last one be go , Uncle Mark say , a little rebukingly , ` Ye should n't a ` et all them candy to onct , Miss Phil .
You 'll likely have the stummick-ache . '
`` Cousin Emily have only five boarder besides myself -- four old lady and one young man .
My right-hand neighbor be Mrs. Lilly .
She be one of those people who seem to take a gruesome pleasure in detail all their many ache and pain and sickness .
You can not mention any ailment but she say , shake her head , ` Ah , I know too well what that be ' -- and then you get all the detail .
Jonas declare he once speak of locomotor ataxia in hearing and she say she know too well what that be .
She suffer from it for ten year and be finally cure by a travel doctor .
`` Who be Jonas ?
Just wait , Anne Shirley .
You 'll hear all about Jonas in the proper time and place .
He be not to be mix up with estimable old lady .
`` My left-hand neighbor at the table be Mrs. Phinney .
She always speak with a wailing , dolorous voice -- you be nervously expect her to burst into tear every moment .
She give you the impression that life to her be indeed a vale of tear , and that a smile , never to speak of a laugh , be a frivolity truly reprehensible .
She have a bad opinion of me than Aunt Jamesina , and she do n't love me hard to atone for it , a Aunty J. do , either .
`` Miss Maria Grimsby sit cati-corner from me .
The first day I come I remark to Miss Maria that it look a little like rain -- and Miss Maria laugh .
I say the road from the station be very pretty -- and Miss Maria laugh .
I say there seem to be a few mosquito leave yet -- and Miss Maria laugh .
I say that Prospect Point be as beautiful a ever -- and Miss Maria laugh .
If I be to say to Miss Maria , ` My father have hang himself , my mother have take poison , my brother be in the penitentiary , and I be in the last stage of consumption , ' Miss Maria would laugh .
She ca n't help it -- she be bear so ; but be very sad and awful .
`` The fifth old lady be Mrs. Grant .
She be a sweet old thing ; but she never say anything but good of anybody and so she be a very uninteresting conversationalist .
`` And now for Jonas , Anne .
`` That first day I come I saw a young man sit opposite me at the table , smile at me a if he have know me from my cradle .
I know , for Uncle Mark have tell me , that his name be Jonas Blake , that he be a Theological Student from St. Columbia , and that he have take charge of the Point Prospect Mission Church for the summer .
`` He be a very ugly young man -- really , the ugly young man I 've ever see .
He have a big , loose-jointed figure with absurdly long leg .
His hair be tow-color and lank , his eye be green , and his mouth be big , and his ear -- but I never think about his ear if I can help it .
`` He have a lovely voice -- if you shut your eye he be adorable -- and he certainly have a beautiful soul and disposition .
`` We be good chum right way .
Of course he be a graduate of Redmond , and that be a link between u .
We fish and boat together ; and we walk on the sand by moonlight .
He do n't look so homely by moonlight and oh , he be nice .
Niceness fairly exhale from him .
The old lady -- except Mrs. Grant -- do n't approve of Jonas , because he laugh and joke -- and because he evidently like the society of frivolous me good than theirs .
`` Somehow , Anne , I do n't want him to think me frivolous .
This be ridiculous .
Why should I care what a tow-haired person call Jonas , whom I never saw before think of me ?
`` Last Sunday Jonas preach in the village church .
I go , of course , but I could n't realize that Jonas be go to preach .
The fact that he be a minister -- or go to be one -- persist in seem a huge joke to me .
`` Well , Jonas preach .
And , by the time he have preach ten minute , I felt so small and insignificant that I think I must be invisible to the naked eye .
Jonas never say a word about woman and he never look at me .
But I realize then and there what a pitiful , frivolous , small-souled little butterfly I be , and how horribly different I must be from Jonas ' ideal woman .
SHE would be grand and strong and noble .
He be so earnest and tender and true .
He be everything a minister ought to be .
I wonder how I could ever have think him ugly -- but he really be !
-- with those inspired eye and that intellectual brow which the roughly-falling hair hid on week day .
`` It be a splendid sermon and I could have listen to it forever , and it make me feel utterly wretched .
Oh , I wish I be like YOU , Anne .
`` He catch up with me on the road home , and grin as cheerfully a usual .
But his grin could never deceive me again .
I have see the REAL Jonas .
I wonder if he could ever see the REAL PHIL -- whom NOBODY , not even you , Anne , have ever see yet . ''
` Jonas , ' I say -- I forget to call him Mr. Blake .
Was n't it dreadful ?
But there be time when thing like that do n't matter -- ` Jonas , you be bear to be a minister .
You COULD N'T be anything else . ' ''
` No , I could n't , ' he say soberly . '
I try to be something else for a long time -- I do n't want to be a minister .
But I come to see at last that it be the work give me to do -- and God help me , I shall try to do it . '
`` His voice be low and reverent .
I think that he would do his work and do it well and nobly ; and happy the woman fit by nature and training to help him do it .
SHE would be no feather , blow about by every fickle wind of fancy .
SHE would always know what hat to put on .
Probably she would have only one .
Ministers never have much money .
But she would n't mind have one hat or none at all , because she would have Jonas .
`` Anne Shirley , do n't you dare to say or hint or think that I 've fall in love with Mr. Blake .
Could I care for a lank , poor , ugly theologue -- name Jonas ?
As Uncle Mark say , ` It 's impossible , and what 's more it 's improbable . '
`` Good night , PHIL . ''
`` P.S . .
It be impossible -- but I be horribly afraid it 's true .
I 'm happy and wretched and scar .
HE can NEVER care for me , I know .
Do you think I could ever develop into a passable minister 's wife , Anne ?
And WOULD they expect me to lead in prayer ?
P G. '' Chapter XXV Enter Prince Charming `` I 'm contrast the claim of indoors and out , '' say Anne , look from the window of Patty 's Place to the distant pine of the park .
`` I 've an afternoon to spend in sweet do nothing , Aunt Jimsie .
Shall I spend it here where there be a cosy fire , a plateful of delicious russet , three purring and harmonious cat , and two impeccable china dog with green nose ?
Or shall I go to the park , where there be the lure of gray wood and of gray water lap on the harbor rock ? ''
`` If I be as young a you , I 'd decide in favor of the park , '' say Aunt Jamesina , tickle Joseph 's yellow ear with a knit needle .
`` I think that you claim to be as young a any of u , Aunty , '' tease Anne .
`` Yes , in my soul .
But I 'll admit my leg be n't as young a yours .
You go and get some fresh air , Anne .
You look pale lately . ''
`` I think I 'll go to the park , '' say Anne restlessly .
`` I do n't feel like tame domestic joy today .
I want to feel alone and free and wild .
The park will be empty , for every one will be at the football match . ''
`` Why do n't you go to it ? '' ''
` Nobody axed me , sir , she say ' -- at least , nobody but that horrid little Dan Ranger .
I would n't go anywhere with him ; but rather than hurt his poor little tender feeling I say I be n't go to the game at all .
I do n't mind .
I 'm not in the mood for football today somehow . ''
`` You go and get some fresh air , '' repeat Aunt Jamesina , `` but take your umbrella , for I believe it 's go to rain .
I 've rheumatism in my leg . ''
`` Only old people should have rheumatism , Aunty . ''
`` Anybody be liable to rheumatism in her leg , Anne .
It 's only old people who should have rheumatism in their soul , though .
Thank goodness , I never have .
When you get rheumatism in your soul you might as well go and pick out your coffin . ''
It be November -- the month of crimson sunset , part bird , deep , sad hymn of the sea , passionate wind-songs in the pine .
Anne roam through the pineland alley in the park and , a she say , let that great sweeping wind blow the fog out of her soul .
Anne be not wont to be trouble with soul fog .
But , somehow , since her return to Redmond for this third year , life have not mirror her spirit back to her with it old , perfect , sparkling clearness .
Outwardly , existence at Patty 's Place be the same pleasant round of work and study and recreation that it have always be .
On Friday even the big , fire-lighted livingroom be crowd by caller and echoed to endless jest and laughter , while Aunt Jamesina smile beamingly on them all .
The `` Jonas '' of Phil 's letter come often , run up from St. Columbia on the early train and depart on the late .
He be a general favorite at Patty 's Place , though Aunt Jamesina shake her head and opine that divinity student be not what they use to be .
`` He 's VERY nice , my dear , '' she tell Phil , `` but minister ought to be graver and more dignified . ''
`` Ca n't a man laugh and laugh and be a Christian still ? ''
demand Phil .
`` Oh , MEN -- yes .
But I be speak of MINISTERS , my dear , '' say Aunt Jamesina rebukingly .
`` And you should n't flirt so with Mr. Blake -- you really should n't . ''
`` I 'm not flirt with him , '' protest Phil .
Nobody believe her , except Anne .
The others think she be amuse herself a usual , and tell her roundly that she be behave very badly .
`` Mr. Blake be n't of the Alec-and-Alonzo type , Phil , '' say Stella severely .
`` He take thing seriously .
You may break his heart . ''
`` Do you really think I could ? ''
ask Phil .
`` I 'd love to think so . ''
`` Philippa Gordon !
I never think you be utterly unfeeling .
The idea of you say you 'd love to break a man 's heart ! ''
`` I do n't say so , honey .
Quote me correctly .
I say I 'd like to think I COULD break it .
I would like to know I have the POWER to do it . ''
`` I do n't understand you , Phil .
You be lead that man on deliberately -- and you know you do n't mean anything by it . ''
`` I mean to make him ask me to marry him if I can , '' say Phil calmly .
`` I give you up , '' say Stella hopelessly .
Gilbert come occasionally on Friday evening .
He seem always in good spirit , and hold his own in the jest and repartee that fly about .
He neither seek nor avoid Anne .
When circumstance bring them in contact he talk to her pleasantly and courteously , a to any newly-made acquaintance .
The old camaraderie be go entirely .
Anne felt it keenly ; but she tell herself she be very glad and thankful that Gilbert have get so completely over his disappointment in regard to her .
She have really be afraid , that April evening in the orchard , that she have hurt him terribly and that the wound would be long in healing .
Now she saw that she need not have worry .
Men have die and the worm have eat them but not for love .
Gilbert evidently be in no danger of immediate dissolution .
He be enjoy life , and he be full of ambition and zest .
For him there be to be no wasting in despair because a woman be fair and cold .
Anne , a she listen to the ceaseless badinage that go on between him and Phil , wonder if she have only imagine that look in his eye when she have tell him she could never care for him .
There be not lack those who would gladly have step into Gilbert 's vacant place .
But Anne snub them without fear and without reproach .
If the real Prince Charming be never to come she would have none of a substitute .
So she sternly tell herself that gray day in the windy park .
Suddenly the rain of Aunt Jamesina 's prophecy come with a swish and rush .
Anne put up her umbrella and hurry down the slope .
As she turn out on the harbor road a savage gust of wind tore along it .
Instantly her umbrella turn wrong side out .
Anne clutch at it in despair .
And then -- there come a voice close to her .
`` Pardon me -- may I offer you the shelter of my umbrella ? ''
Anne look up .
Tall and handsome and distinguished-looking -- dark , melancholy , inscrutable eye -- melt , musical , sympathetic voice -- yes , the very hero of her dream stand before her in the flesh .
He could not have more closely resemble her ideal if he have be make to order .
`` Thank you , '' she say confusedly .
`` We 'd better hurry over to that little pavillion on the point , '' suggest the unknown .
`` We can wait there until this shower be over .
It be not likely to rain so heavily very long . ''
The word be very commonplace , but oh , the tone !
And the smile which accompany them !
Anne felt her heart beating strangely .
Together they scurry to the pavilion and sit breathlessly down under it friendly roof .
Anne laughingly hold up her false umbrella .
`` It be when my umbrella turn inside out that I be convince of the total depravity of inanimate thing , '' she say gaily .
The raindrop sparkle on her shin hair ; it loosened ring curl around her neck and forehead .
Her cheek be flush , her eye big and starry .
Her companion look down at her admiringly .
She felt herself blush under his gaze .
Who could he be ?
Why , there be a bit of the Redmond white and scarlet pin to his coat lapel .
Yet she have think she know , by sight at least , all the Redmond student except the Freshmen .
And this courtly youth surely be no Freshman .
`` We be schoolmate , I see , '' he say , smile at Anne 's color .
`` That ought to be sufficient introduction .
My name be Royal Gardner .
And you be the Miss Shirley who read the Tennyson paper at the Philomathic the other evening , be n't you ? ''
`` Yes ; but I can not place you at all , '' say Anne , frankly .
`` Please , where DO you belong ? ''
`` I feel a if I do n't belong anywhere yet .
I put in my Freshman and Sophomore year at Redmond two year ago .
I 've be in Europe ever since .
Now I 've come back to finish my Arts course . ''
`` This be my Junior year , too , '' say Anne .
`` So we be classmate as well a collegemates .
I be reconcile to the loss of the year that the locust have eat , '' say her companion , with a world of meaning in those wonderful eye of his .
The rain come steadily down for the best part of an hour .
But the time seem really very short .
When the cloud part and a burst of pale November sunshine fell athwart the harbor and the pine Anne and her companion walk home together .
By the time they have reach the gate of Patty 's Place he have ask permission to call , and have receive it .
Anne go in with cheek of flame and her heart beating to her fingertip .
Rusty , who climb into her lap and try to kiss her , find a very absent welcome .
Anne , with her soul full of romantic thrill , have no attention to spare just then for a crop-eared pussy cat .
That even a parcel be leave at Patty 's Place for Miss Shirley .
It be a box contain a dozen magnificent rose .
Phil pounce impertinently on the card that fell from it , read the name and the poetical quotation write on the back .
`` Royal Gardner ! ''
she exclaim .
`` Why , Anne , I do n't know you be acquaint with Roy Gardner ! ''
`` I meet him in the park this afternoon in the rain , '' explain Anne hurriedly .
`` My umbrella turn inside out and he come to my rescue with his . ''
`` Oh ! ''
Phil peer curiously at Anne .
`` And be that exceedingly commonplace incident any reason why he should send u longstemmed rose by the dozen , with a very sentimental rhyme ?
Or why we should blush divine rosy-red when we look at his card ?
Anne , thy face betrayeth thee . ''
`` Do n't talk nonsense , Phil .
Do you know Mr. Gardner ? ''
`` I 've meet his two sister , and I know of him .
So do everybody worthwhile in Kingsport .
The Gardners be among the rich , blue , of Bluenoses .
Roy be adorably handsome and clever .
Two year ago his mother 's health fail and he have to leave college and go abroad with her -- his father be dead .
He must have be greatly disappointed to have to give up his class , but they say he be perfectly sweet about it .
Fee -- fi -- fo -- fum , Anne .
I smell romance .
Almost do I envy you , but not quite .
After all , Roy Gardner be n't Jonas . ''
`` You goose ! ''
say Anne loftily .
But she lay long awake that night , nor do she wish for sleep .
Her wake fancy be more alluring than any vision of dreamland .
Had the real Prince come at last ?
Recalling those glorious dark eye which have gaze so deeply into her own , Anne be very strongly incline to think he have .
Chapter XXVI Enter Christine The girl at Patty 's Place be dress for the reception which the Juniors be give for the Seniors in February .
Anne survey herself in the mirror of the blue room with girlish satisfaction .
She have a particularly pretty gown on .
Originally it have be only a simple little slip of cream silk with a chiffon overdress .
But Phil have insist on take it home with her in the Christmas holiday and embroider tiny rosebud all over the chiffon .
Phil 's finger be deft , and the result be a dress which be the envy of every Redmond girl .
Even Allie Boone , whose frock come from Paris , be wont to look with longing eye on that rosebud concoction a Anne trail up the main staircase at Redmond in it .
Anne be try the effect of a white orchid in her hair .
Roy Gardner have send her white orchid for the reception , and she know no other Redmond girl would have them that night -- when Phil come in with admire gaze .
`` Anne , this be certainly your night for look handsome .
Nine night out of ten I can easily outshine you .
The tenth you blossom out suddenly into something that eclipse me altogether .
How do you manage it ? ''
`` It 's the dress , dear .
Fine feather . '' ''
'T be n't .
The last evening you flame out into beauty you wear your old blue flannel shirtwaist that Mrs. Lynde make you .
If Roy have n't already lose head and heart about you he certainly would tonight .
But I do n't like orchid on you , Anne .
No ; it be n't jealousy .
Orchids do n't seem to BELONG to you .
They 're too exotic -- too tropical -- too insolent .
Do n't put them in your hair , anyway . ''
`` Well , I wo n't .
I admit I 'm not fond of orchid myself .
I do n't think they 're relate to me .
Roy do n't often send them -- he know I like flower I can live with .
Orchids be only thing you can visit with . ''
`` Jonas send me some dear pink rosebud for the evening -- but -- he be n't come himself .
He say he have to lead a prayer-meeting in the slum !
I do n't believe he want to come .
Anne , I 'm horribly afraid Jonas do n't really care anything about me .
And I 'm try to decide whether I 'll pine away and die , or go on and get my B.A . and be sensible and useful . ''
`` You could n't possibly be sensible and useful , Phil , so you 'd better pine away and die , '' say Anne cruelly .
`` Heartless Anne ! ''
`` Silly Phil !
You know quite well that Jonas love you . ''
`` But -- he wo n't TELL me so .
And I ca n't MAKE him .
He LOOKS it , I 'll admit .
But speak-to-me-only-with-thine-eyes be n't a really reliable reason for embroider doily and hemstitch tablecloth .
I do n't want to begin such work until I 'm really engage .
It would be tempt Fate . ''
`` Mr. Blake be afraid to ask you to marry him , Phil .
He be poor and ca n't offer you a home such a you 've always have .
You know that be the only reason he have n't speak long ago . ''
`` I suppose so , '' agree Phil dolefully .
`` Well '' -- brighten up -- `` if he WO N'T ask me to marry him I 'll ask him , that 's all .
So it 's bind to come right .
I wo n't worry .
By the way , Gilbert Blythe be go about constantly with Christine Stuart .
Did you know ? ''
Anne be try to fasten a little gold chain about her throat .
She suddenly find the clasp difficult to manage .
WHAT be the matter with it -- or with her finger ?
`` No , '' she say carelessly .
`` Who be Christine Stuart ? ''
`` Ronald Stuart 's sister .
She 's in Kingsport this winter study music .
I have n't see her , but they say she 's very pretty and that Gilbert be quite crazy over her .
How angry I be when you refuse Gilbert , Anne .
But Roy Gardner be foreordain for you .
I can see that now .
You be right , after all . ''
Anne do not blush , a she usually do when the girl assume that her eventual marriage to Roy Gardner be a settled thing .
All at once she felt rather dull .
Phil 's chatter seem trivial and the reception a bore .
She box poor Rusty 's ear .
`` Get off that cushion instantly , you cat , you !
Why do n't you stay down where you belong ? ''
Anne pick up her orchid and go downstairs , where Aunt Jamesina be preside over a row of coat hang before the fire to warm .
Roy Gardner be wait for Anne and tease the Sarah-cat while he wait .
The Sarah-cat do not approve of him .
She always turn her back on him .
But everybody else at Patty 's Place like him very much .
Aunt Jamesina , carry away by his unfailing and deferential courtesy , and the pleading tone of his delightful voice , declare he be the nice young man she ever know , and that Anne be a very fortunate girl .
Such remark make Anne restive .
Roy 's wooing have certainly be as romantic a girlish heart could desire , but -- she wish Aunt Jamesina and the girl would not take thing so for grant .
When Roy murmur a poetical compliment a he help her on with her coat , she do not blush and thrill a usual ; and he find her rather silent in their brief walk to Redmond .
He think she look a little pale when she come out of the coeds ' dressing room ; but a they enter the reception room her color and sparkle suddenly return to her .
She turn to Roy with her gay expression .
He smile back at her with what Phil call `` his deep , black , velvety smile . ''
Yet she really do not see Roy at all .
She be acutely conscious that Gilbert be stand under the palm just across the room talk to a girl who must be Christine Stuart .
She be very handsome , in the stately style destine to become rather massive in middle life .
A tall girl , with large dark-blue eye , ivory outline , and a gloss of darkness on her smooth hair .
`` She look just a I 've always want to look , '' think Anne miserably .
`` Rose-leaf complexion -- starry violet eye -- raven hair -- yes , she have them all .
It 's a wonder her name be n't Cordelia Fitzgerald into the bargain !
But I do n't believe her figure be as good a mine , and her nose certainly be n't . ''
Anne felt a little comfort by this conclusion .
Chapter XXVII Mutual Confidences March come in that winter like the meek and mild of lamb , bring day that be crisp and golden and tingling , each follow by a frosty pink twilight which gradually lose itself in an elfland of moonshine .
Over the girl at Patty 's Place be fall the shadow of April examination .
They be study hard ; even Phil have settle down to text and notebook with a doggedness not to be expect of her .
`` I 'm go to take the Johnson Scholarship in Mathematics , '' she announce calmly .
`` I could take the one in Greek easily , but I 'd rather take the mathematical one because I want to prove to Jonas that I 'm really enormously clever . ''
`` Jonas like you good for your big brown eye and your crooked smile than for all the brain you carry under your curl , '' say Anne .
`` When I be a girl it be n't consider lady-like to know anything about Mathematics , '' say Aunt Jamesina .
`` But time have change .
I do n't know that it 's all for the good .
Can you cook , Phil ? ''
`` No , I never cook anything in my life except a gingerbread and it be a failure -- flat in the middle and hilly round the edge .
You know the kind .
But , Aunty , when I begin in good earnest to learn to cook do n't you think the brain that enable me to win a mathematical scholarship will also enable me to learn cooking just as well ? ''
`` Maybe , '' say Aunt Jamesina cautiously .
`` I be not decry the high education of woman .
My daughter be an M.A . .
She can cook , too .
But I teach her to cook BEFORE I let a college professor teach her Mathematics . ''
In mid-March come a letter from Miss Patty Spofford , say that she and Miss Maria have decide to remain abroad for another year .
`` So you may have Patty 's Place next winter , too , '' she write .
`` Maria and I be go to run over Egypt .
I want to see the Sphinx once before I die . ''
`` Fancy those two dame ` run over Egypt ' !
I wonder if they 'll look up at the Sphinx and knit , '' laugh Priscilla .
`` I 'm so glad we can keep Patty 's Place for another year , '' say Stella .
`` I be afraid they 'd come back .
And then our jolly little nest here would be break up -- and we poor callow nestling throw out on the cruel world of boardinghouse again . ''
`` I 'm off for a tramp in the park , '' announce Phil , toss her book aside .
`` I think when I be eighty I 'll be glad I go for a walk in the park tonight . ''
`` What do you mean ? ''
ask Anne .
`` Come with me and I 'll tell you , honey . ''
They capture in their ramble all the mystery and magic of a March evening .
Very still and mild it be , wrap in a great , white , brooding silence -- a silence which be yet thread through with many little silvery sound which you could hear if you hearken a much with your soul a your ear .
The girl wander down a long pineland aisle that seem to lead right out into the heart of a deep-red , overflow winter sunset .
`` I 'd go home and write a poem this bless minute if I only know how , '' declare Phil , pause in an open space where a rosy light be stain the green tip of the pine .
`` It 's all so wonderful here -- this great , white stillness , and those dark tree that always seem to be think . '' ''
` The wood be God 's first temple , ' '' quote Anne softly .
`` One ca n't help feel reverent and adore in such a place .
I always feel so near Him when I walk among the pine . ''
`` Anne , I 'm the happy girl in the world , '' confess Phil suddenly .
`` So Mr. Blake have ask you to marry him at last ? ''
say Anne calmly .
`` Yes .
And I sneeze three time while he be ask me .
Was n't that horrid ?
But I say ` yes ' almost before he finish -- I be so afraid he might change his mind and stop .
I 'm besottedly happy .
I could n't really believe before that Jonas would ever care for frivolous me . ''
`` Phil , you 're not really frivolous , '' say Anne gravely . ''
` Way down underneath that frivolous exterior of yours you 've get a dear , loyal , womanly little soul .
Why do you hide it so ? ''
`` I ca n't help it , Queen Anne .
You be right -- I 'm not frivolous at heart .
But there 's a sort of frivolous skin over my soul and I ca n't take it off .
As Mrs. Poyser say , I 'd have to be hatch over again and hatch different before I could change it .
But Jonas know the real me and love me , frivolity and all .
And I love him .
I never be so surprised in my life a I be when I find out I love him .
I 'd never think it possible to fall in love with an ugly man .
Fancy me come down to one solitary beau .
And one name Jonas !
But I mean to call him Jo .
That 's such a nice , crisp little name .
I could n't nickname Alonzo . ''
`` What about Alec and Alonzo ? ''
`` Oh , I tell them at Christmas that I never could marry either of them .
It seem so funny now to remember that I ever think it possible that I might .
They felt so badly I just cry over both of them -- howl .
But I know there be only one man in the world I could ever marry .
I have make up my own mind for once and it be real easy , too .
It 's very delightful to feel so sure , and know it 's your own sureness and not somebody else 's . ''
`` Do you suppose you 'll be able to keep it up ? ''
`` Making up my mind , you mean ?
I do n't know , but Jo have give me a splendid rule .
He say , when I 'm perplexed , just to do what I would wish I have do when I shall be eighty .
Anyhow , Jo can make up his mind quickly enough , and it would be uncomfortable to have too much mind in the same house . ''
`` What will your father and mother say ? ''
`` Father wo n't say much .
He think everything I do right .
But mother WILL talk .
Oh , her tongue will be as Byrney a her nose .
But in the end it will be all right . ''
`` You 'll have to give up a good many thing you 've always have , when you marry Mr. Blake , Phil . ''
`` But I 'll have HIM .
I wo n't miss the other thing .
We 're to be marry a year from next June .
Jo graduate from St. Columbia this spring , you know .
Then he 's go to take a little mission church down on Patterson Street in the slum .
Fancy me in the slum !
But I 'd go there or to Greenland 's icy mountain with him . ''
`` And this be the girl who would NEVER marry a man who be n't rich , '' comment Anne to a young pine tree .
`` Oh , do n't cast up the folly of my youth to me .
I shall be poor as gaily a I 've be rich .
You 'll see .
I 'm go to learn how to cook and make over dress .
I 've learn how to market since I 've live at Patty 's Place ; and once I teach a Sunday School class for a whole summer .
Aunt Jamesina say I 'll ruin Jo 's career if I marry him .
But I wo n't .
I know I have n't much sense or sobriety , but I 've get what be ever so much good -- the knack of make people like me .
There be a man in Bolingbroke who lisp and always testifies in prayer-meeting .
He say , ` If you ca n't thine like an electric thtar thine like a candlethtick . '
I 'll be Jo 's little candlestick . ''
`` Phil , you 're incorrigible .
Well , I love you so much that I ca n't make nice , light , congratulatory little speech .
But I 'm heart-glad of your happiness . ''
`` I know .
Those big gray eye of yours be brim over with real friendship , Anne .
Some day I 'll look the same way at you .
You 're go to marry Roy , be n't you , Anne ? ''
`` My dear Philippa , do you ever hear of the famous Betty Baxter , who ` refuse a man before he 'd ax her ' ?
I be not go to emulate that celebrated lady by either refusing or accept any one before he ` ax ' me . ''
`` All Redmond know that Roy be crazy about you , '' say Phil candidly .
`` And you DO love him , do n't you , Anne ? ''
`` I -- I suppose so , '' say Anne reluctantly .
She felt that she ought to be blush while make such a confession ; but she be not ; on the other hand , she always blush hotly when any one say anything about Gilbert Blythe or Christine Stuart in her hearing .
Gilbert Blythe and Christine Stuart be nothing to her -- absolutely nothing .
But Anne have give up try to analyze the reason of her blush .
As for Roy , of course she be in love with him -- madly so .
How could she help it ?
Was he not her ideal ?
Who could resist those glorious dark eye , and that plead voice ?
Were not half the Redmond girl wildly envious ?
And what a charming sonnet he have send her , with a box of violet , on her birthday !
Anne know every word of it by heart .
It be very good stuff of it kind , too .
Not exactly up to the level of Keats or Shakespeare -- even Anne be not so deeply in love a to think that .
But it be very tolerable magazine verse .
And it be address to HER -- not to Laura or Beatrice or the Maid of Athens , but to her , Anne Shirley .
To be tell in rhythmical cadence that her eye be star of the morning -- that her cheek have the flush it steal from the sunrise -- that her lip be red than the rose of Paradise , be thrillingly romantic .
Gilbert would never have dream of write a sonnet to her eyebrow .
But then , Gilbert could see a joke .
She have once tell Roy a funny story -- and he have not see the point of it .
She recall the chummy laugh she and Gilbert have have together over it , and wonder uneasily if life with a man who have no sense of humor might not be somewhat uninteresting in the long run .
But who could expect a melancholy , inscrutable hero to see the humorous side of thing ?
It would be flatly unreasonable .
Chapter XXVIII A June Evening `` I wonder what it would be like to live in a world where it be always June , '' say Anne , a she come through the spice and bloom of the twilit orchard to the front door step , where Marilla and Mrs. Rachel be sit , talk over Mrs. Samson Coates ' funeral , which they have attend that day .
Dora sit between them , diligently study her lesson ; but Davy be sit tailor-fashion on the grass , look a gloomy and depress a his single dimple would let him .
`` You 'd get tire of it , '' say Marilla , with a sigh .
`` I daresay ; but just now I feel that it would take me a long time to get tire of it , if it be all as charm a today .
Everything love June .
Davy-boy , why this melancholy November face in blossom-time ? ''
`` I 'm just sick and tired of living , '' say the youthful pessimist .
`` At ten year ?
Dear me , how sad ! ''
`` I 'm not make fun , '' say Davy with dignity .
`` I 'm dis -- dis -- discourage '' -- bring out the big word with a valiant effort .
`` Why and wherefore ? ''
ask Anne , sit down beside him . ''
'Cause the new teacher that come when Mr. Holmes get sick give me ten sum to do for Monday .
It 'll take me all day tomorrow to do them .
It be n't fair to have to work Saturdays .
Milty Boulter say he would n't do them , but Marilla say I 've get to .
I do n't like Miss Carson a bit . ''
`` Do n't talk like that about your teacher , Davy Keith , '' say Mrs. Rachel severely .
`` Miss Carson be a very fine girl .
There be no nonsense about her . ''
`` That do n't sound very attractive , '' laugh Anne .
`` I like people to have a little nonsense about them .
But I 'm inclined to have a good opinion of Miss Carson than you have .
I saw her in prayer-meeting last night , and she have a pair of eye that ca n't always look sensible .
Now , Davy-boy , take heart of grace .
` Tomorrow will bring another day ' and I 'll help you with the sum as far a in me lie .
Do n't waste this lovely hour ` twixt light and dark worrying over arithmetic . ''
`` Well , I wo n't , '' say Davy , brighten up .
`` If you help me with the sum I 'll have 'em do in time to go fishing with Milty .
I wish old Aunt Atossa 's funeral be tomorrow instead of today .
I want to go to it 'cause Milty say his mother say Aunt Atossa would be sure to rise up in her coffin and say sarcastic thing to the folk that come to see her bury .
But Marilla say she do n't . ''
`` Poor Atossa laid in her coffin peaceful enough , '' say Mrs. Lynde solemnly .
`` I never saw her look so pleasant before , that 's what .
Well , there be n't many tear shed over her , poor old soul .
The Elisha Wrights be thankful to be rid of her , and I ca n't say I blame them a mite . ''
`` It seem to me a most dreadful thing to go out of the world and not leave one person behind you who be sorry you be go , '' say Anne , shudder .
`` Nobody except her parent ever love poor Atossa , that 's certain , not even her husband , '' aver Mrs. Lynde .
`` She be his fourth wife .
He 'd sort of got into the habit of marrying .
He only live a few year after he marry her .
The doctor say he die of dyspepsia , but I shall always maintain that he die of Atossa 's tongue , that 's what .
Poor soul , she always know everything about her neighbor , but she never be very well acquaint with herself .
Well , she 's go anyhow ; and I suppose the next excitement will be Diana 's wedding . ''
`` It seem funny and horrible to think of Diana 's be marry , '' sigh Anne , hug her knee and look through the gap in the Haunted Wood to the light that be shin in Diana 's room .
`` I do n't see what 's horrible about it , when she 's do so well , '' say Mrs. Lynde emphatically .
`` Fred Wright have a fine farm and he be a model young man . ''
`` He certainly be n't the wild , dash , wicked , young man Diana once want to marry , '' smile Anne .
`` Fred be extremely good . ''
`` That 's just what he ought to be .
Would you want Diana to marry a wicked man ?
Or marry one yourself ? ''
`` Oh , no .
I would n't want to marry anybody who be wicked , but I think I 'd like it if he COULD be wicked and WOULD N'T .
Now , Fred be HOPELESSLY good . ''
`` You 'll have more sense some day , I hope , '' say Marilla .
Marilla speak rather bitterly .
She be grievously disappointed .
She know Anne have refuse Gilbert Blythe .
Avonlea gossip buzz over the fact , which have leak out , nobody know how .
Perhaps Charlie Sloane have guess and tell his guess for truth .
Perhaps Diana have betray it to Fred and Fred have be indiscreet .
At all event it be know ; Mrs. Blythe no longer ask Anne , in public or private , if she have hear lately from Gilbert , but pass her by with a frosty bow .
Anne , who have always like Gilbert 's merry , young-hearted mother , be grieve in secret over this .
Marilla say nothing ; but Mrs. Lynde give Anne many exasperate dig about it , until fresh gossip reach that worthy lady , through the medium of Moody Spurgeon MacPherson 's mother , that Anne have another `` beau '' at college , who be rich and handsome and good all in one .
After that Mrs. Rachel hold her tongue , though she still wish in her inmost heart that Anne have accept Gilbert .
Riches be all very well ; but even Mrs. Rachel , practical soul though she be , do not consider them the one essential .
If Anne `` like '' the Handsome Unknown good than Gilbert there be nothing more to be say ; but Mrs. Rachel be dreadfully afraid that Anne be go to make the mistake of marry for money .
Marilla know Anne too well to fear this ; but she felt that something in the universal scheme of thing have go sadly awry .
`` What be to be , will be , '' say Mrs. Rachel gloomily , `` and what be n't to be happen sometimes .
I ca n't help believe it 's go to happen in Anne 's case , if Providence do n't interfere , that 's what . ''
Mrs. Rachel sigh .
She be afraid Providence would n't interfere ; and she do n't dare to .
Anne have wander down to the Dryad 's Bubble and be curl up among the fern at the root of the big white birch where she and Gilbert have so often sat in summer go by .
He have go into the newspaper office again when college close , and Avonlea seem very dull without him .
He never write to her , and Anne miss the letter that never come .
To be sure , Roy write twice a week ; his letter be exquisite composition which would have read beautifully in a memoir or biography .
Anne felt herself more deeply in love with him than ever when she read them ; but her heart never give the queer , quick , painful bound at sight of his letter which it have give one day when Mrs. Hiram Sloane have hand her out an envelope address in Gilbert 's black , upright handwriting .
Anne have hurry home to the east gable and open it eagerly -- to find a typewritten copy of some college society report -- `` only that and nothing more . ''
Anne fling the harmless screed across her room and sit down to write an especially nice epistle to Roy .
Diana be to be marry in five more day .
The gray house at Orchard Slope be in a turmoil of baking and brewing and boiling and stewing , for there be to be a big , old-timey wedding .
Anne , of course , be to be bridesmaid , a have be arrange when they be twelve year old , and Gilbert be come from Kingsport to be best man .
Anne be enjoy the excitement of the various preparation , but under it all she carry a little heartache .
She be , in a sense , lose her dear old chum ; Diana 's new home would be two mile from Green Gables , and the old constant companionship could never be theirs again .
Anne look up at Diana 's light and think how it have beacon to her for many year ; but soon it would shine through the summer twilights no more .
Two big , painful tear well up in her gray eye .
`` Oh , '' she think , `` how horrible it be that people have to grow up -- and marry -- and CHANGE ! ''
Chapter XXIX Diana 's Wedding `` After all , the only real rose be the pink one , '' say Anne , a she tie white ribbon around Diana 's bouquet in the westward-looking gable at Orchard Slope .
`` They be the flower of love and faith . ''
Diana be stand nervously in the middle of the room , array in her bridal white , her black curl frost over with the film of her wedding veil .
Anne have drape that veil , in accordance with the sentimental compact of year before .
`` It 's all pretty much a I use to imagine it long ago , when I weep over your inevitable marriage and our consequent parting , '' she laugh .
`` You be the bride of my dream , Diana , with the ` lovely misty veil ' ; and I be YOUR bridesmaid .
But , ala !
I have n't the puffed sleeve -- though these short lace one be even pretty .
Neither be my heart wholly break nor do I exactly hate Fred . ''
`` We be not really part , Anne , '' protest Diana .
`` I 'm not go far away .
We 'll love each other just as much a ever .
We 've always keep that ` oath ' of friendship we swear long ago , have n't we ? ''
`` Yes .
We 've keep it faithfully .
We 've have a beautiful friendship , Diana .
We 've never mar it by one quarrel or coolness or unkind word ; and I hope it will always be so .
But thing ca n't be quite the same after this .
You 'll have other interest .
I 'll just be on the outside .
But ` such be life ' a Mrs. Rachel say .
Mrs. Rachel have give you one of her beloved knitted quilt of the ` tobacco stripe ' pattern , and she say when I be married she 'll give me one , too . ''
`` The mean thing about your get marry be that I wo n't be able to be your bridesmaid , '' lament Diana .
`` I 'm to be Phil 's bridesmaid next June , when she marry Mr. Blake , and then I must stop , for you know the proverb ` three time a bridesmaid , never a bride , ' '' say Anne , peep through the window over the pink and snow of the blossom orchard beneath .
`` Here come the minister , Diana . ''
`` Oh , Anne , '' gasp Diana , suddenly turn very pale and begin to tremble .
`` Oh , Anne -- I 'm so nervous -- I ca n't go through with it -- Anne , I know I 'm go to faint . ''
`` If you do I 'll drag you down to the rainwater hogshed and drop you in , '' say Anne unsympathetically .
`` Cheer up , dear .
Getting married ca n't be so very terrible when so many people survive the ceremony .
See how cool and compose I be , and take courage . ''
`` Wait till your turn come , Miss Anne .
Oh , Anne , I hear father come upstairs .
Give me my bouquet .
Is my veil right ?
Am I very pale ? ''
`` You look just lovely .
Di , darling , kiss me good-bye for the last time .
Diana Barry will never kiss me again . ''
`` Diana Wright will , though .
There , mother 's call .
Come . ''
Following the simple , old-fashioned way in vogue then , Anne go down to the parlor on Gilbert 's arm .
They meet at the top of the stair for the first time since they have leave Kingsport , for Gilbert have arrive only that day .
Gilbert shake hand courteously .
He be look very well , though , a Anne instantly note , rather thin .
He be not pale ; there be a flush on his cheek that have burn into it a Anne come along the hall towards him , in her soft , white dress with lilies-of-the-valley in the shining mass of her hair .
As they enter the crowd parlor together a little murmur of admiration ran around the room .
`` What a fine-looking pair they be , '' whisper the impressible Mrs. Rachel to Marilla .
Fred amble in alone , with a very red face , and then Diana sweep in on her father 's arm .
She do not faint , and nothing untoward occur to interrupt the ceremony .
Feasting and merry-making follow ; then , a the evening wan , Fred and Diana drive away through the moonlight to their new home , and Gilbert walk with Anne to Green Gables .
Something of their old comradeship have return during the informal mirth of the evening .
Oh , it be nice to be walk over that well-known road with Gilbert again !
The night be so very still that one should have be able to hear the whisper of rose in blossom -- the laughter of daisy -- the piping of grass -- many sweet sound , all tangle up together .
The beauty of moonlight on familiar field irradiate the world .
`` Ca n't we take a ramble up Lovers ' Lane before you go in ? ''
ask Gilbert a they cross the bridge over the Lake of Shining Waters , in which the moon lay like a great , drown blossom of gold .
Anne assent readily .
Lovers ' Lane be a veritable path in a fairyland that night -- a shimmering , mysterious place , full of wizardry in the white-woven enchantment of moonlight .
There have be a time when such a walk with Gilbert through Lovers ' Lane would have be far too dangerous .
But Roy and Christine have make it very safe now .
Anne find herself think a good deal about Christine a she chat lightly to Gilbert .
She have meet her several time before leave Kingsport , and have be charmingly sweet to her .
Christine have also be charmingly sweet .
Indeed , they be a most cordial pair .
But for all that , their acquaintance have not ripen into friendship .
Evidently Christine be not a kindred spirit .
`` Are you go to be in Avonlea all summer ? ''
ask Gilbert .
`` No .
I 'm go down east to Valley Road next week .
Esther Haythorne want me to teach for her through July and August .
They have a summer term in that school , and Esther be n't feel well .
So I 'm go to substitute for her .
In one way I do n't mind .
Do you know , I 'm begin to feel a little bit like a stranger in Avonlea now ?
It make me sorry -- but it 's true .
It 's quite appalling to see the number of child who have shoot up into big boy and girl -- really young men and woman -- these past two year .
Half of my pupil be grow up .
It make me feel awfully old to see them in the place you and I and our mate use to fill . ''
Anne laugh and sigh .
She felt very old and mature and wise -- which show how young she be .
She tell herself that she long greatly to go back to those dear merry day when life be see through a rosy mist of hope and illusion , and possess an indefinable something that have pass away forever .
Where be it now -- the glory and the dream ? ''
` So wag the world away , ' '' quote Gilbert practically , and a trifle absently .
Anne wonder if he be think of Christine .
Oh , Avonlea be go to be so lonely now -- with Diana go !
Chapter XXX Mrs. Skinner 's Romance Anne step off the train at Valley Road station and look about to see if any one have come to meet her .
She be to board with a certain Miss Janet Sweet , but she saw no one who answer in the least to her preconception of that lady , a form from Esther 's letter .
The only person in sight be an elderly woman , sit in a wagon with mail bag pile around her .
Two hundred would have be a charitable guess at her weight ; her face be a round and red a a harvest-moon and almost a featureless .
She wear a tight , black , cashmere dress , make in the fashion of ten year ago , a little dusty black straw hat trim with bow of yellow ribbon , and fade black lace mit .
`` Here , you , '' she call , wave her whip at Anne .
`` Are you the new Valley Road schoolma'am ? ''
`` Yes . ''
`` Well , I think so .
Valley Road be note for it good-looking schoolma'am , just a Millersville be note for it humly one .
Janet Sweet ask me this morning if I could bring you out .
I say , ` Sartin I kin , if she do n't mind be scrunch up some .
This rig of mine 's kinder small for the mail bag and I 'm some hefty than Thomas ! '
Just wait , miss , till I shift these bag a bit and I 'll tuck you in somehow .
It 's only two mile to Janet 's .
Her next-door neighbor 's hired boy be come for your trunk tonight .
My name be Skinner -- Amelia Skinner . ''
Anne be eventually tuck in , exchange amused smile with herself during the process .
`` Jog along , black mare , '' command Mrs. Skinner , gather up the rein in her pudgy hand .
`` This be my first trip on the mail rowte .
Thomas want to hoe his turnip today so he ask me to come .
So I jest sot down and take a standing-up snack and start .
I sorter like it .
O ' course it 's rather teju .
Part of the time I sits and think and the rest I jest sits .
Jog along , black mare .
I want to git home airly .
Thomas be terrible lonesome when I 'm away .
You see , we have n't be marry very long . ''
`` Oh ! ''
say Anne politely .
`` Just a month .
Thomas court me for quite a spell , though .
It be real romantic . ''
Anne try to picture Mrs. Skinner on speaking term with romance and fail .
`` Oh ? ''
she say again .
`` Yes .
Y ` see , there be another man after me .
Jog along , black mare .
I 'd be a widder so long folk have give up expect me to marry again .
But when my darter -- she 's a schoolma'am like you -- go out West to teach I felt real lonesome and be n't nowise sot against the idea .
Bime-by Thomas begin to come up and so do the other feller -- William Obadiah Seaman , his name be .
For a long time I could n't make up my mind which of them to take , and they kep ' come and come , and I kep ' worrying .
Y ` see , W.O . be rich -- he have a fine place and carry considerable style .
He be by far the best match .
Jog along , black mare . ''
`` Why do n't you marry him ? ''
ask Anne .
`` Well , y ` see , he do n't love me , '' answer Mrs. Skinner , solemnly .
Anne open her eye widely and look at Mrs. Skinner .
But there be not a glint of humor on that lady 's face .
Evidently Mrs. Skinner saw nothing amusing in her own case .
`` He 'd be a widder-man for three yers , and his sister keep house for him .
Then she get married and he just want some one to look after his house .
It be worth look after , too , mind you that .
It 's a handsome house .
Jog along , black mare .
As for Thomas , he be poor , and if his house do n't leak in dry weather it be about all that could be say for it , though it look kind of pictureaskew .
But , y ` see , I love Thomas , and I do n't care one red cent for W.O . .
So I argue it out with myself .
` Sarah Crowe , ' say I -- my first be a Crowe -- ` you can marry your rich man if you like but you wo n't be happy .
Folks ca n't get along together in this world without a little bit of love .
You 'd just well tie up to Thomas , for he love you and you love him and nothing else ai n't go to do you . '
Jog along , black mare .
So I tell Thomas I 'd take him .
All the time I be get ready I never dare drive past W.O . 's place for fear the sight of that fine house of his would put me in the swither again .
But now I never think of it at all , and I 'm just that comfortable and happy with Thomas .
Jog along , black mare . ''
`` How do William Obadiah take it ? ''
query Anne .
`` Oh , he rumpus a bit .
But he 's go to see a skinny old maid in Millersville now , and I guess she 'll take him fast enough .
She 'll make him a good wife than his first do .
W.O . never want to marry her .
He just ask her to marry him 'cause his father want him to , never dream but that she 'd say ` no . '
But mind you , she say ` yes . '
There be a predicament for you .
Jog along , black mare .
She be a great housekeeper , but most awful mean .
She wear the same bonnet for eighteen year .
Then she get a new one and W.O . meet her on the road and do n't know her .
Jog along , black mare .
I feel that I 'd a narrer escape .
I might have marry him and be most awful miserable , like my poor cousin , Jane Ann .
Jane Ann marry a rich man she do n't care anything about , and she have n't the life of a dog .
She come to see me last week and say , say she , ` Sarah Skinner , I envy you .
I 'd rather live in a little hut on the side of the road with a man I be fond of than in my big house with the one I 've get . '
Jane Ann 's man ai n't such a bad sort , nuther , though he 's so contrary that he wear his fur coat when the thermometer 's at ninety .
The only way to git him to do anything be to coax him to do the opposite .
But there ai n't any love to smooth thing down and it 's a poor way of living .
Jog along , black mare .
There 's Janet 's place in the hollow -- ` Wayside , ' she call it .
Quite pictureaskew , ai n't it ?
I guess you 'll be glad to git out of this , with all them mail bag jam round you . ''
`` Yes , but I have enjoy my drive with you very much , '' say Anne sincerely .
`` Git away now ! ''
say Mrs. Skinner , highly flatter .
`` Wait till I tell Thomas that .
He always feel dretful tickle when I git a compliment .
Jog along , black mare .
Well , here we be .
I hope you 'll git on well in the school , miss .
There 's a short cut to it through the ma ` sh back of Janet 's .
If you take that way be awful keerful .
If you once get stick in that black mud you 'd be suck right down and never see or hear tell of again till the day of judgment , like Adam Palmer 's cow .
Jog along , black mare . ''
Chapter XXXI Anne to Philippa `` Anne Shirley to Philippa Gordon , greeting .
`` Well-beloved , it 's high time I be write you .
Here be I , instal once more a a country ` schoolma'am ' at Valley Road , board at ` Wayside , ' the home of Miss Janet Sweet .
Janet be a dear soul and very nicelooking ; tall , but not over-tall ; stoutish , yet with a certain restraint of outline suggestive of a thrifty soul who be not go to be overlavish even in the matter of avoirdupois .
She have a knot of soft , crimpy , brown hair with a thread of gray in it , a sunny face with rosy cheek , and big , kind eye as blue a forget-me-not .
Moreover , she be one of those delightful , old-fashioned cook who do n't care a bit if they ruin your digestion as long a they can give you feast of fat thing .
`` I like her ; and she like me -- principally , it seem , because she have a sister name Anne who die young . ''
` I 'm real glad to see you , ' she say briskly , when I land in her yard .
` My , you do n't look a mite like I expect .
I be sure you 'd be dark -- my sister Anne be dark .
And here you 're redheaded ! '
`` For a few minute I think I be n't go to like Janet as much a I have expect at first sight .
Then I remind myself that I really must be more sensible than to be prejudice against any one simply because she call my hair red .
Probably the word ` auburn ' be not in Janet 's vocabulary at all . ''
` Wayside ' be a dear sort of little spot .
The house be small and white , set down in a delightful little hollow that drop away from the road .
Between road and house be an orchard and flower-garden all mix up together .
The front door walk be border with quahog clam-shells -- ` cow-hawks , ' Janet call them ; there be Virginia Creeper over the porch and moss on the roof .
My room be a neat little spot ` off the parlor ' -- just big enough for the bed and me .
Over the head of my bed there be a picture of Robby Burns stand at Highland Mary 's grave , shadow by an enormous weeping willow tree .
Robby 's face be so lugubrious that it be no wonder I have bad dream .
Why , the first night I be here I dream I COULD N'T LAUGH .
`` The parlor be tiny and neat .
Its one window be so shade by a huge willow that the room have a grotto-like effect of emerald gloom .
There be wonderful tidy on the chair , and gay mat on the floor , and book and card carefully arrange on a round table , and vas of dried grass on the mantel-piece .
Between the vas be a cheerful decoration of preserved coffin plate -- five in all , pertain respectively to Janet 's father and mother , a brother , her sister Anne , and a hired man who die here once !
If I go suddenly insane some of these day ` know all men by these present ' that those coffin-plates have cause it .
`` But it 's all delightful and I say so .
Janet love me for it , just a she detest poor Esther because Esther have say so much shade be unhygienic and have object to sleep on a feather bed .
Now , I glory in feather-beds , and the more unhygienic and feathery they be the more I glory .
Janet say it be such a comfort to see me eat ; she have be so afraid I would be like Miss Haythorne , who would n't eat anything but fruit and hot water for breakfast and try to make Janet give up fry thing .
Esther be really a dear girl , but she be rather give to fad .
The trouble be that she have n't enough imagination and HAS a tendency to indigestion .
`` Janet tell me I could have the use of the parlor when any young men call !
I do n't think there be many to call .
I have n't see a young man in Valley Road yet , except the next-door hired boy -- Sam Toliver , a very tall , lank , tow-haired youth .
He come over one evening recently and sit for an hour on the garden fence , near the front porch where Janet and I be do fancy-work .
The only remark he volunteer in all that time be , ` Hev a peppermint , miss !
Dew now-fine thing for carARRH , peppermint , ' and , ` Powerful lot o ' jump-grasses round here ternight .
Yep . '
`` But there be a love affair go on here .
It seem to be my fortune to be mix up , more or less actively , with elderly love affair .
Mr. and Mrs. Irving always say that I bring about their marriage .
Mrs. Stephen Clark of Carmody persist in be most grateful to me for a suggestion which somebody else would probably have make if I have n't .
I do really think , though , that Ludovic Speed would never have get any far along than placid courtship if I have not help him and Theodora Dix out .
`` In the present affair I be only a passive spectator .
I 've try once to help thing along and make an awful mess of it .
So I shall not meddle again .
I 'll tell you all about it when we meet . ''
Chapter XXXII Tea with Mrs. Douglas On the first Thursday night of Anne 's sojourn in Valley Road Janet ask her to go to prayer-meeting .
Janet blossom out like a rise to attend that prayer-meeting .
She wear a pale-blue , pansy-sprinkled muslin dress with more ruffle than one would ever have suppose economical Janet could be guilty of , and a white leghorn hat with pink rose and three ostrich feather on it .
Anne felt quite amaze .
Later on , she find out Janet 's motive in so array herself -- a motive as old a Eden .
Valley Road prayer-meetings seem to be essentially feminine .
There be thirty-two woman present , two half-grown boy , and one solitary man , beside the minister .
Anne find herself study this man .
He be not handsome or young or graceful ; he have remarkably long legs -- so long that he have to keep them coil up under his chair to dispose of them -- and he be stoop-shouldered .
His hand be big , his hair want barbering , and his moustache be unkempt .
But Anne think she like his face ; it be kind and honest and tender ; there be something else in it , too -- just what , Anne find it hard to define .
She finally conclude that this man have suffer and be strong , and it have be make manifest in his face .
There be a sort of patient , humorous endurance in his expression which indicate that he would go to the stake if need be , but would keep on look pleasant until he really have to begin squirm .
When prayer-meeting be over this man come up to Janet and say , `` May I see you home , Janet ? ''
Janet take his arm -- `` a primly and shyly a if she be no more than sixteen , have her first escort home , '' Anne tell the girl at Patty 's Place later on .
`` Miss Shirley , permit me to introduce Mr. Douglas , '' she say stiffly .
Mr. Douglas nod and say , `` I be look at you in prayer-meeting , miss , and think what a nice little girl you be . ''
Such a speech from ninety-nine people out of a hundred would have annoy Anne bitterly ; but the way in which Mr. Douglas say it make her feel that she have receive a very real and pleasing compliment .
She smile appreciatively at him and drop obligingly behind on the moonlit road .
So Janet have a beau !
Anne be delight .
Janet would make a paragon of a wife -- cheery , economical , tolerant , and a very queen of cook .
It would be a flagrant waste on Nature 's part to keep her a permanent old maid .
`` John Douglas ask me to take you up to see his mother , '' say Janet the next day .
`` She 's bed-rid a lot of the time and never go out of the house .
But she 's powerful fond of company and always want to see my boarder .
Can you go up this evening ? ''
Anne assent ; but later in the day Mr. Douglas call on his mother 's behalf to invite them up to tea on Saturday evening .
`` Oh , why do n't you put on your pretty pansy dress ? ''
ask Anne , when they leave home .
It be a hot day , and poor Janet , between her excitement and her heavy black cashmere dress , look a if she be be broil alive .
`` Old Mrs. Douglas would think it terrible frivolous and unsuitable , I 'm afraid .
John like that dress , though , '' she add wistfully .
The old Douglas homestead be half a mile from `` Wayside '' crest a windy hill .
The house itself be large and comfortable , old enough to be dignify , and girdle with maple grove and orchard .
There be big , trim barn behind it , and everything bespoke prosperity .
Whatever the patient endurance in Mr. Douglas ' face have mean it have n't , so Anne reflect , meant debt and dun .
John Douglas meet them at the door and take them into the sitting-room , where his mother be enthrone in an armchair .
Anne have expect old Mrs. Douglas to be tall and thin , because Mr. Douglas be .
Instead , she be a tiny scrap of a woman , with soft pink cheek , mild blue eye , and a mouth like a baby 's .
Dressed in a beautiful , fashionably-made black silk dress , with a fluffy white shawl over her shoulder , and her snowy hair surmount by a dainty lace cap , she might have pose a a grandmother doll .
`` How do you do , Janet dear ? ''
she say sweetly .
`` I be so glad to see you again , dear . ''
She put up her pretty old face to be kiss .
`` And this be our new teacher .
I 'm delighted to meet you .
My son have be sing your praise until I 'm half jealous , and I 'm sure Janet ought to be wholly so . ''
Poor Janet blush , Anne say something polite and conventional , and then everybody sit down and make talk .
It be hard work , even for Anne , for nobody seem at ease except old Mrs. Douglas , who certainly do not find any difficulty in talk .
She make Janet sit by her and stroke her hand occasionally .
Janet sit and smile , look horribly uncomfortable in her hideous dress , and John Douglas sit without smile .
At the tea table Mrs. Douglas gracefully ask Janet to pour the tea .
Janet turn red than ever but do it .
Anne write a description of that meal to Stella .
`` We have cold tongue and chicken and strawberry preserve , lemon pie and tart and chocolate cake and raisin cooky and pound cake and fruit cake -- and a few other thing , include more pie -- caramel pie , I think it be .
After I have eat twice as much a be good for me , Mrs. Douglas sigh and say she fear she have nothing to tempt my appetite . ''
` I 'm afraid dear Janet 's cooking have spoil you for any other , ' she say sweetly .
` Of course nobody in Valley Road aspire to rival HER .
WO N'T you have another piece of pie , Miss Shirley ?
You have n't eat ANYTHING . '
`` Stella , I have eat a help of tongue and one of chicken , three biscuit , a generous allowance of preserve , a piece of pie , a tart , and a square of chocolate cake ! ''
After tea Mrs. Douglas smile benevolently and tell John to take `` dear Janet '' out into the garden and get her some rose .
`` Miss Shirley will keep me company while you be out -- wo n't you ? ''
she say plaintively .
She settle down in her armchair with a sigh .
`` I be a very frail old woman , Miss Shirley .
For over twenty year I 've be a great sufferer .
For twenty long , weary year I 've be die by inch . ''
`` How painful ! ''
say Anne , try to be sympathetic and succeed only in feel idiotic .
`` There have be score of night when they 've think I could never live to see the dawn , '' go on Mrs. Douglas solemnly .
`` Nobody know what I 've go through -- nobody can know but myself .
Well , it ca n't last very much long now .
My weary pilgrimage will soon be over , Miss Shirley .
It be a great comfort to me that John will have such a good wife to look after him when his mother be go -- a great comfort , Miss Shirley . ''
`` Janet be a lovely woman , '' say Anne warmly .
`` Lovely !
A beautiful character , '' assent Mrs. Douglas .
`` And a perfect housekeeper -- something I never be .
My health would not permit it , Miss Shirley .
I be indeed thankful that John have make such a wise choice .
I hope and believe that he will be happy .
He be my only son , Miss Shirley , and his happiness lie very near my heart . ''
`` Of course , '' say Anne stupidly .
For the first time in her life she be stupid .
Yet she could not imagine why .
She seem to have absolutely nothing to say to this sweet , smile , angelic old lady who be pat her hand so kindly .
`` Come and see me soon again , dear Janet , '' say Mrs. Douglas lovingly , when they leave .
`` You do n't come half often enough .
But then I suppose John will be bring you here to stay all the time one of these day . ''
Anne , happen to glance at John Douglas , a his mother speak , give a positive start of dismay .
He look a a tortured man might look when his tormentor give the rack the last turn of possible endurance .
She felt sure he must be ill and hurried poor blush Janet away .
`` Is n't old Mrs. Douglas a sweet woman ? ''
ask Janet , a they go down the road .
`` M -- m , '' answer Anne absently .
She be wonder why John Douglas have look so .
`` She 's be a terrible sufferer , '' say Janet feelingly .
`` She take terrible spell .
It keep John all worry up .
He 's scar to leave home for fear his mother will take a spell and nobody there but the hired girl . ''
Chapter XXXIII `` He Just Kept Coming and Coming '' Three day later Anne come home from school and find Janet cry .
Tears and Janet seem so incongruous that Anne be honestly alarm .
`` Oh , what be the matter ? ''
she cry anxiously .
`` I 'm -- I 'm forty today , '' sob Janet .
`` Well , you be nearly that yesterday and it do n't hurt , '' comfort Anne , try not to smile .
`` But -- but , '' go on Janet with a big gulp , `` John Douglas wo n't ask me to marry him . ''
`` Oh , but he will , '' say Anne lamely .
`` You must give him time , Janet `` Time ! ''
say Janet with indescribable scorn .
`` He have have twenty year .
How much time do he want ? ''
`` Do you mean that John Douglas have be come to see you for twenty year ? ''
`` He have .
And he have never so much a mentioned marriage to me .
And I do n't believe he ever will now .
I 've never say a word to a mortal about it , but it seem to me I 've just get to talk it out with some one at last or go crazy .
John Douglas begin to go with me twenty year ago , before mother die .
Well , he keep come and come , and after a spell I begin make quilt and thing ; but he never say anything about get marry , only just keep come and come .
There be n't anything I could do .
Mother die when we 'd be go together for eight year .
I think he maybe would speak out then , see a I be leave alone in the world .
He be real kind and feeling , and do everything he could for me , but he never say marry .
And that 's the way it have be go on ever since .
People blame ME for it .
They say I wo n't marry him because his mother be so sickly and I do n't want the bother of wait on her .
Why , I 'd LOVE to wait on John 's mother !
But I let them think so .
I 'd rather they 'd blame me than pity me !
It 's so dreadful humiliating that John wo n't ask me .
And WHY wo n't he ?
Seems to me if I only know his reason I would n't mind it so much . ''
`` Perhaps his mother do n't want him to marry anybody , '' suggest Anne .
`` Oh , she do .
She 's tell me time and again that she 'd love to see John settle before her time come .
She 's always give him hint -- you hear her yourself the other day .
I think I 'd ha ' go through the floor . ''
`` It 's beyond me , '' say Anne helplessly .
She think of Ludovic Speed .
But the case be not parallel .
John Douglas be not a man of Ludovic 's type .
`` You should show more spirit , Janet , '' she go on resolutely .
`` Why do n't you send him about his business long ago ? ''
`` I could n't , '' say poor Janet pathetically .
`` You see , Anne , I 've always be awful fond of John .
He might just as well keep come a not , for there be never anybody else I 'd want , so it do n't matter . ''
`` But it might have make him speak out like a man , '' urge Anne .
Janet shake her head .
`` No , I guess not .
I be afraid to try , anyway , for fear he 'd think I mean it and just go .
I suppose I 'm a poor-spirited creature , but that be how I feel .
And I ca n't help it . ''
`` Oh , you COULD help it , Janet .
It be n't too late yet .
Take a firm stand .
Let that man know you be not go to endure his shillyshally any long .
I 'LL back you up . ''
`` I dunno , '' say Janet hopelessly .
`` I dunno if I could ever get up enough spunk .
Things have drift so long .
But I 'll think it over . ''
Anne felt that she be disappoint in John Douglas .
She have like him so well , and she have not think him the sort of man who would play fast and loose with a woman 's feeling for twenty year .
He certainly should be teach a lesson , and Anne felt vindictively that she would enjoy see the process .
Therefore she be delighted when Janet tell her , a they be go to prayer-meeting the next night , that she mean to show some `` sperrit . ''
`` I 'll let John Douglas see I 'm not go to be tread on any longer . ''
`` You be perfectly right , '' say Anne emphatically .
When prayer-meeting be over John Douglas come up with his usual request .
Janet look frighten but resolute .
`` No , thank you , '' she say icily .
`` I know the road home pretty well alone .
I ought to , see I 've be travel it for forty year .
So you need n't trouble yourself , MR. Douglas . ''
Anne be look at John Douglas ; and , in that brilliant moonlight , she saw the last twist of the rack again .
Without a word he turn and stride down the road .
`` Stop !
Stop ! ''
Anne call wildly after him , not care in the least for the other dumbfounded onlooker .
`` Mr. Douglas , stop !
Come back . ''
John Douglas stop but he do not come back .
Anne fly down the road , catch his arm and fairly drag him back to Janet .
`` You must come back , '' she say imploringly .
`` It 's all a mistake , Mr. Douglas -- all my fault .
I make Janet do it .
She do n't want to -- but it 's all right now , be n't it , Janet ? ''
Without a word Janet take his arm and walk away .
Anne follow them meekly home and slip in by the back door .
`` Well , you be a nice person to back me up , '' say Janet sarcastically .
`` I could n't help it , Janet , '' say Anne repentantly .
`` I just felt a if I have stand by and see murder do .
I HAD to run after him . ''
`` Oh , I 'm just a glad you do .
When I saw John Douglas make off down that road I just felt a if every little bit of joy and happiness that be leave in my life be go with him .
It be an awful feeling . ''
`` Did he ask you why you do it ? ''
ask Anne .
`` No , he never say a word about it , '' reply Janet dully .
Chapter XXXIV John Douglas Speaks at Last Anne be not without a feeble hope that something might come of it after all .
But nothing do .
John Douglas come and take Janet driving , and walk home from prayer-meeting with her , a he have be do for twenty year , and a he seem likely to do for twenty year more .
The summer wan .
Anne teach her school and write letter and study a little .
Her walk to and from school be pleasant .
She always go by way of the swamp ; it be a lovely place -- a boggy soil , green with the greenest of mossy hillock ; a silvery brook meander through it and spruce stand erectly , their bough a-trail with gray-green moss , their root overgrown with all sort of woodland loveliness .
Nevertheless , Anne find life in Valley Road a little monotonous .
To be sure , there be one diverting incident .
She have not see the lank , tow-headed Samuel of the peppermint since the evening of his call , save for chance meeting on the road .
But one warm August night he appear , and solemnly seat himself on the rustic bench by the porch .
He wear his usual working habiliment , consist of varipatched trouser , a blue jean shirt , out at the elbow , and a ragged straw hat .
He be chew a straw and he keep on chew it while he look solemnly at Anne .
Anne lay her book aside with a sigh and take up her doily .
Conversation with Sam be really out of the question .
After a long silence Sam suddenly speak .
`` I 'm leave over there , '' he say abruptly , wave his straw in the direction of the neighboring house .
`` Oh , be you ? ''
say Anne politely .
`` Yep . ''
`` And where be you go now ? ''
`` Wall , I 've be think some of gitting a place of my own .
There 's one that 'd suit me over at Millersville .
But ef I rent it I 'll want a woman . ''
`` I suppose so , '' say Anne vaguely .
`` Yep . ''
There be another long silence .
Finally Sam remove his straw again and say , `` Will yeh hev me ? ''
`` Wh -- a -- t ! ''
gasp Anne .
`` Will yeh hev me ? ''
`` Do you mean -- MARRY you ? ''
queried poor Anne feebly .
`` Yep . ''
`` Why , I 'm hardly acquaint with you , '' cry Anne indignantly .
`` But yeh 'd git acquaint with me after we be marry , '' say Sam .
Anne gather up her poor dignity .
`` Certainly I wo n't marry you , '' she say haughtily .
`` Wall , yeh might do bad , '' expostulate Sam .
`` I 'm a good worker and I 've get some money in the bank . ''
`` Do n't speak of this to me again .
Whatever put such an idea into your head ? ''
say Anne , her sense of humor get the good of her wrath .
It be such an absurd situation .
`` Yeh 're a likely-looking girl and hev a right-smart way o ' stepping , '' say Sam .
`` I do n't want no lazy woman .
Think it over .
I wo n't change my mind yit awhile .
Wall , I must be gitting .
Gotter milk the cow . ''
Anne 's illusion concern proposal have suffer so much of late year that there be few of them leave .
So she could laugh wholeheartedly over this one , not feel any secret sting .
She mimic poor Sam to Janet that night , and both of them laugh immoderately over his plunge into sentiment .
One afternoon , when Anne 's sojourn in Valley Road be draw to a close , Alec Ward come drive down to `` Wayside '' in hot haste for Janet .
`` They want you at the Douglas place quick , '' he say .
`` I really believe old Mrs. Douglas be go to die at last , after pretend to do it for twenty year . ''
Janet run to get her hat .
Anne ask if Mrs. Douglas be bad than usual .
`` She 's not half a bad , '' say Alec solemnly , `` and that 's what make me think it 's serious .
Other time she 'd be scream and throw herself all over the place .
This time she 's lie still and mum .
When Mrs. Douglas be mum she be pretty sick , you bet . ''
`` You do n't like old Mrs. Douglas ? ''
say Anne curiously .
`` I like cat a IS cat .
I do n't like cat a be woman , '' be Alec 's cryptic reply .
Janet come home in the twilight .
`` Mrs. Douglas be dead , '' she say wearily .
`` She die soon after I get there .
She just speak to me once -- ' I suppose you 'll marry John now ? '
she say .
It cut me to the heart , Anne .
To think John 's own mother think I would n't marry him because of her !
I could n't say a word either -- there be other woman there .
I be thankful John have go out . ''
Janet begin to cry drearily .
But Anne brew her a hot drink of ginger tea to her comforting .
To be sure , Anne discover later on that she have use white pepper instead of ginger ; but Janet never know the difference .
The evening after the funeral Janet and Anne be sit on the front porch step at sunset .
The wind have fall asleep in the pinelands and lurid sheet of heat-lightning flicker across the northern sky .
Janet wear her ugly black dress and look her very worst , her eye and nose red from cry .
They talk little , for Janet seem faintly to resent Anne 's effort to cheer her up .
She plainly prefer to be miserable .
Suddenly the gate-latch clicked and John Douglas strode into the garden .
He walk towards them straight over the geranium bed .
Janet stand up .
So do Anne .
Anne be a tall girl and wear a white dress ; but John Douglas do not see her .
`` Janet , '' he say , `` will you marry me ? ''
The word burst out a if they have be want to be say for twenty year and MUST be utter now , before anything else .
Janet 's face be so red from cry that it could n't turn any redder , so it turn a most unbecoming purple .
`` Why do n't you ask me before ? ''
she say slowly .
`` I could n't .
She make me promise not to -- mother make me promise not to .
Nineteen year ago she take a terrible spell .
We think she could n't live through it .
She implore me to promise not to ask you to marry me while she be alive .
I do n't want to promise such a thing , even though we all think she could n't live very long -- the doctor only give her six month .
But she beg it on her knee , sick and suffering .
I have to promise . ''
`` What have your mother against me ? ''
cried Janet .
`` Nothing -- nothing .
She just do n't want another woman -- ANY woman -- there while she be live .
She say if I do n't promise she 'd die right there and I 'd have kill her .
So I promise .
And she 's hold me to that promise ever since , though I 've go on my knee to her in my turn to beg her to let me off . ''
`` Why do n't you tell me this ? ''
ask Janet chokingly .
`` If I 'd only KNOWN !
Why do n't you just tell me ? ''
`` She make me promise I would n't tell a soul , '' say John hoarsely .
`` She swear me to it on the Bible ; Janet , I 'd never have do it if I 'd dream it be to be for so long .
Janet , you 'll never know what I 've suffer these nineteen year .
I know I 've make you suffer , too , but you 'll marry me for all , wo n't you , Janet ?
Oh , Janet , wo n't you ?
I 've come as soon a I could to ask you . ''
At this moment the stupefied Anne come to her sens and realize that she have no business to be there .
She slip away and do not see Janet until the next morning , when the latter tell her the rest of the story .
`` That cruel , relentless , deceitful old woman ! ''
cry Anne .
`` Hush -- she 's dead , '' say Janet solemnly .
`` If she be n't -- but she IS .
So we must n't speak evil of her .
But I 'm happy at last , Anne .
And I would n't have mind wait so long a bit if I 'd only know why . ''
`` When be you to be marry ? ''
`` Next month .
Of course it will be very quiet .
I suppose people will talk terrible .
They 'll say I make enough haste to snap John up as soon a his poor mother be out of the way .
John want to let them know the truth but I say , ` No , John ; after all she be your mother , and we 'll keep the secret between u , and not cast any shadow on her memory .
I do n't mind what people say , now that I know the truth myself .
It do n't matter a mite .
Let it all be bury with the dead ' say I to him .
So I coax him round to agree with me . ''
`` You 're much more forgiving than I could ever be , '' Anne say , rather crossly .
`` You 'll feel differently about a good many thing when you get to be my age , '' say Janet tolerantly .
`` That 's one of the thing we learn a we grow old -- how to forgive .
It come easy at forty than it do at twenty . ''
Chapter XXXV The Last Redmond Year Opens `` Here we be , all back again , nicely sunburn and rejoice a a strong man to run a race , '' say Phil , sit down on a suitcase with a sigh of pleasure .
`` Is n't it jolly to see this dear old Patty 's Place again -- and Aunty -- and the cat ?
Rusty have lose another piece of ear , have n't he ? ''
`` Rusty would be the nice cat in the world if he have no ear at all , '' declare Anne loyally from her trunk , while Rusty writhe about her lap in a frenzy of welcome .
`` Are n't you glad to see u back , Aunty ? ''
demand Phil .
`` Yes .
But I wish you 'd tidy thing up , '' say Aunt Jamesina plaintively , look at the wilderness of trunk and suitcase by which the four laughing , chatter girl be surround .
`` You can talk just as well later on .
Work first and then play use to be my motto when I be a girl . ''
`` Oh , we 've just reverse that in this generation , Aunty .
OUR motto be play your play and then dig in .
You can do your work so much good if you 've have a good bout of play first . ''
`` If you be go to marry a minister , '' say Aunt Jamesina , pick up Joseph and her knitting and resign herself to the inevitable with the charm grace that make her the queen of housemother , `` you will have to give up such expression a ` dig in . ' ''
`` Why ? ''
moan Phil .
`` Oh , why must a minister 's wife be suppose to utter only prune and prism ?
I sha n't .
Everybody on Patterson Street use slang -- that be to say , metaphorical language -- and if I do n't they would think me insufferably proud and stick up . ''
`` Have you break the news to your family ? ''
ask Priscilla , feed the Sarah-cat bit from her lunchbasket .
Phil nod .
`` How do they take it ? ''
`` Oh , mother rampage .
But I stand rockfirm -- even I , Philippa Gordon , who never before could hold fast to anything .
Father be calmer .
Father 's own daddy be a minister , so you see he have a soft spot in his heart for the cloth .
I have Jo up to Mount Holly , after mother grow calm , and they both love him .
But mother give him some frightful hint in every conversation regard what she have hop for me .
Oh , my vacation pathway have n't be exactly strew with rose , girl dear .
But -- I 've win out and I 've get Jo .
Nothing else matter . ''
`` To you , '' say Aunt Jamesina darkly .
`` Nor to Jo , either , '' retort Phil .
`` You keep on pity him .
Why , pray ?
I think he 's to be envy .
He 's get brain , beauty , and a heart of gold in ME . ''
`` It 's well we know how to take your speech , '' say Aunt Jamesina patiently .
`` I hope you do n't talk like that before stranger .
What would they think ? ''
`` Oh , I do n't want to know what they think .
I do n't want to see myself a others see me .
I 'm sure it would be horribly uncomfortable most of the time .
I do n't believe Burns be really sincere in that prayer , either . ''
`` Oh , I daresay we all pray for some thing that we really do n't want , if we be only honest enough to look into our heart , '' own Aunt Jamesina candidly .
`` I 've a notion that such prayer do n't rise very far .
I use to pray that I might be enable to forgive a certain person , but I know now I really do n't want to forgive her .
When I finally get that I DID want to I forgive her without have to pray about it . ''
`` I ca n't picture you a be unforgiving for long , '' say Stella .
`` Oh , I use to be .
But hold spite do n't seem worth while when you get along in year . ''
`` That remind me , '' say Anne , and tell the tale of John and Janet .
`` And now tell u about that romantic scene you hint so darkly at in one of your letter , '' demand Phil .
Anne act out Samuel 's proposal with great spirit .
The girl shriek with laughter and Aunt Jamesina smile .
`` It be n't in good taste to make fun of your beau , '' she say severely ; `` but , '' she add calmly , `` I always do it myself . ''
`` Tell u about your beau , Aunty , '' entreat Phil .
`` You must have have any number of them . ''
`` They 're not in the past tense , '' retort Aunt Jamesina .
`` I 've get them yet .
There be three old widower at home who have be cast sheep 's eye at me for some time .
You child need n't think you own all the romance in the world . ''
`` Widowers and sheep 's eye do n't sound very romantic , Aunty . ''
`` Well , no ; but young folk be n't always romantic either .
Some of my beau certainly be n't .
I use to laugh at them scandalous , poor boy .
There be Jim Elwood -- he be always in a sort of day-dream -- never seem to sense what be go on .
He do n't wake up to the fact that I 'd say ` no ' till a year after I 'd say it .
When he do get marry his wife fell out of the sleigh one night when they be drive home from church and he never miss her .
Then there be Dan Winston .
He know too much .
He know everything in this world and most of what be in the next .
He could give you an answer to any question , even if you ask him when the Judgment Day be to be .
Milton Edwards be real nice and I like him but I do n't marry him .
For one thing , he take a week to get a joke through his head , and for another he never ask me .
Horatio Reeve be the most interesting beau I ever have .
But when he tell a story he dress it up so that you could n't see it for frill .
I never could decide whether he be lie or just let his imagination run loose . ''
`` And what about the others , Aunty ? ''
`` Go away and unpack , '' say Aunt Jamesina , wave Joseph at them by mistake for a needle .
`` The others be too nice to make fun of .
I shall respect their memory .
There 's a box of flower in your room , Anne .
They come about an hour ago . ''
After the first week the girl of Patty 's Place settle down to a steady grind of study ; for this be their last year at Redmond and graduation honor must be fight for persistently .
Anne devote herself to English , Priscilla pore over classic , and Philippa pound away at Mathematics .
Sometimes they grow tire , sometimes they felt discourage , sometimes nothing seem worth the struggle for it .
In one such mood Stella wander up to the blue room one rainy November evening .
Anne sit on the floor in a little circle of light cast by the lamp beside her , amid a surround snow of crumpled manuscript .
`` What in the world be you do ? ''
`` Just look over some old Story Club yarn .
I want something to cheer AND inebriate .
I 'd study until the world seem azure .
So I come up here and dig these out of my trunk .
They be so drench in tear and tragedy that they be excruciatingly funny . ''
`` I 'm blue and discourage myself , '' say Stella , throw herself on the couch .
`` Nothing seem worthwhile .
My very thought be old .
I 've think them all before .
What be the use of living after all , Anne ? ''
`` Honey , it 's just brain fag that make u feel that way , and the weather .
A pouring rainy night like this , come after a hard day 's grind , would squelch any one but a Mark Tapley .
You know it IS worthwhile to live . ''
`` Oh , I suppose so .
But I ca n't prove it to myself just now . ''
`` Just think of all the great and noble soul who have live and work in the world , '' say Anne dreamily .
`` Is n't it worthwhile to come after them and inherit what they win and teach ?
Is n't it worthwhile to think we can share their inspiration ?
And then , all the great soul that will come in the future ?
Is n't it worthwhile to work a little and prepare the way for them -- make just one step in their path easy ? ''
`` Oh , my mind agree with you , Anne .
But my soul remain doleful and uninspired .
I 'm always grubby and dingy on rainy night . ''
`` Some night I like the rain -- I like to lie in bed and hear it patter on the roof and drift through the pine . ''
`` I like it when it stay on the roof , '' say Stella .
`` It do n't always .
I spend a gruesome night in an old country farmhouse last summer .
The roof leak and the rain come patter down on my bed .
There be no poetry in THAT .
I have to get up in the ` mirk midnight ' and chivy round to pull the bedstead out of the drip -- and it be one of those solid , old-fashioned bed that weigh a ton -- more or less .
And then that drip-drop , drip-drop keep up all night until my nerve just go to piece .
You 've no idea what an eerie noise a great drop of rain fall with a mushy thud on a bare floor make in the night .
It sound like ghostly footstep and all that sort of thing .
What be you laugh over , Anne ? ''
`` These story .
As Phil would say they be kill -- in more sens than one , for everybody die in them .
What dazzlingly lovely heroine we have -- and how we dress them !
`` Silks -- satin -- velvet -- jewel -- lace -- they never wear anything else .
Here be one of Jane Andrews ' story depict her heroine a sleeping in a beautiful white satin nightdress trim with seed pearl . ''
`` Go on , '' say Stella .
`` I begin to feel that life be worth live as long a there 's a laugh in it . ''
`` Here 's one I write .
My heroine be disport herself at a ball ` glitter from head to foot with large diamond of the first water . '
But what boot beauty or rich attire ?
` The path of glory lead but to the grave . '
They must either be murder or die of a broken heart .
There be no escape for them . ''
`` Let me read some of your story . ''
`` Well , here 's my masterpiece .
Note it cheerful title -- ` My Graves . '
I shed quart of tear while write it , and the other girl shed gallon while I read it .
Jane Andrews ' mother scold her frightfully because she have so many handkerchief in the wash that week .
It 's a harrowing tale of the wandering of a Methodist minister 's wife .
I make her a Methodist because it be necessary that she should wander .
She bury a child every place she live in .
There be nine of them and their graf be sever far apart , range from Newfoundland to Vancouver .
I describe the child , picture their several death bed , and detail their tombstone and epitaph .
I have intend to bury the whole nine but when I have dispose of eight my invention of horror give out and I permit the ninth to live a a hopeless cripple . ''
While Stella read My Graves , punctuate it tragic paragraph with chuckle , and Rusty sleep the sleep of a just cat who have be out all night curl up on a Jane Andrews tale of a beautiful maiden of fifteen who go to nurse in a leper colony -- of course dying of the loathsome disease finally -- Anne glance over the other manuscript and recall the old day at Avonlea school when the member of the Story Club , sit under the spruce tree or down among the fern by the brook , have write them .
What fun they have have !
How the sunshine and mirth of those olden summer return a she read .
Not all the glory that be Greece or the grandeur that be Rome could weave such wizardry a those funny , tearful tale of the Story Club .
Among the manuscript Anne find one write on sheet of wrap paper .
A wave of laughter fill her gray eye a she recall the time and place of it genesis .
It be the sketch she have write the day she fell through the roof of the Cobb duckhouse on the Tory Road .
Anne glance over it , then fell to read it intently .
It be a little dialogue between aster and sweet-peas , wild canary in the lilac bush , and the guardian spirit of the garden .
After she have read it , she sit , star into space ; and when Stella have go she smooth out the crumpled manuscript .
`` I believe I will , '' she say resolutely .
Chapter XXXVI The Gardners ` Call `` Here be a letter with an Indian stamp for you , Aunt Jimsie , '' say Phil .
`` Here be three for Stella , and two for Pris , and a glorious fat one for me from Jo .
There 's nothing for you , Anne , except a circular . ''
Nobody notice Anne 's flush a she take the thin letter Phil toss her carelessly .
But a few minute later Phil look up to see a transfigured Anne .
`` Honey , what good thing have happen ? ''
`` The Youth 's Friend have accept a little sketch I send them a fortnight ago , '' say Anne , try hard to speak a if she be accustom to have sketch accept every mail , but not quite succeed .
`` Anne Shirley !
How glorious !
What be it ?
When be it to be publish ?
Did they pay you for it ? ''
`` Yes ; they 've send a check for ten dollar , and the editor write that he would like to see more of my work .
Dear man , he shall .
It be an old sketch I find in my box .
I re-wrote it and send it in -- but I never really think it could be accept because it have no plot , '' say Anne , recall the bitter experience of Averil 's Atonement .
`` What be you go to do with that ten dollar , Anne ?
Let 's all go up town and get drunk , '' suggest Phil .
`` I AM go to squander it in a wild soulless revel of some sort , '' declare Anne gaily .
`` At all event it be n't tainted money -- like the check I get for that horrible Reliable Baking Powder story .
I spend IT usefully for clothes and hat them every time I put them on . ''
`` Think of have a real live author at Patty 's Place , '' say Priscilla .
`` It 's a great responsibility , '' say Aunt Jamesina solemnly .
`` Indeed it be , '' agree Pris with equal solemnity .
`` Authors be kittle cattle .
You never know when or how they will break out .
Anne may make copy of u . ''
`` I mean that the ability to write for the Press be a great responsibility , '' say Aunt Jamesina severely , `` and I hope Anne realizes , it .
My daughter use to write story before she go to the foreign field , but now she have turn her attention to high thing .
She use to say her motto be ` Never write a line you would be ashamed to read at your own funeral . '
You 'd better take that for yours , Anne , if you be go to embark in literature .
Though , to be sure , '' add Aunt Jamesina perplexedly , `` Elizabeth always use to laugh when she say it .
She always laugh so much that I do n't know how she ever come to decide on be a missionary .
I 'm thankful she do -- I pray that she might -- but -- I wish she have n't . ''
Then Aunt Jamesina wonder why those giddy girl all laugh .
Anne 's eye shine all that day ; literary ambition sprout and bud in her brain ; their exhilaration accompany her to Jennie Cooper 's walk party , and not even the sight of Gilbert and Christine , walk just ahead of her and Roy , could quite subdue the sparkle of her starry hope .
Nevertheless , she be not so rapt from thing of earth a to be unable to notice that Christine 's walk be decidedly ungraceful .
`` But I suppose Gilbert look only at her face .
So like a man , '' think Anne scornfully .
`` Shall you be home Saturday afternoon ? ''
ask Roy .
`` Yes . ''
`` My mother and sister be come to call on you , '' say Roy quietly .
Something go over Anne which might be describe a a thrill , but it be hardly a pleasant one .
She have never meet any of Roy 's family ; she realize the significance of his statement ; and it have , somehow , an irrevocableness about it that chill her .
`` I shall be glad to see them , '' she say flatly ; and then wonder if she really would be glad .
She ought to be , of course .
But would it not be something of an ordeal ?
Gossip have filter to Anne regard the light in which the Gardners view the `` infatuation '' of son and brother .
Roy must have bring pressure to bear in the matter of this call .
Anne know she would be weigh in the balance .
From the fact that they have consent to call she understand that , willingly or unwillingly , they regard her a a possible member of their clan .
`` I shall just be myself .
I shall not TRY to make a good impression , '' think Anne loftily .
But she be wonder what dress she would well wear Saturday afternoon , and if the new style of high hair-dressing would suit her good than the old ; and the walk party be rather spoiled for her .
By night she have decide that she would wear her brown chiffon on Saturday , but would do her hair low .
Friday afternoon none of the girl have class at Redmond .
Stella take the opportunity to write a paper for the Philomathic Society , and be sit at the table in the corner of the living-room with an untidy litter of note and manuscript on the floor around her .
Stella always vow she never could write anything unless she throw each sheet down a she complete it .
Anne , in her flannel blouse and serge skirt , with her hair rather blown from her windy walk home , be sit squarely in the middle of the floor , tease the Sarah-cat with a wishbone .
Joseph and Rusty be both curl up in her lap .
A warm plummy odor fill the whole house , for Priscilla be cook in the kitchen .
Presently she come in , enshroud in a huge work-apron , with a smudge of flour on her nose , to show Aunt Jamesina the chocolate cake she have just ice .
At this auspicious moment the knocker sound .
Nobody pay any attention to it save Phil , who spring up and open it , expect a boy with the hat she have buy that morning .
On the doorstep stand Mrs. Gardner and her daughter .
Anne scramble to her foot somehow , empty two indignant cat out of her lap a she do so , and mechanically shift her wishbone from her right hand to her left .
Priscilla , who would have have to cross the room to reach the kitchen door , lose her head , wildly plunge the chocolate cake under a cushion on the inglenook sofa , and dash upstairs .
Stella begin feverishly gather up her manuscript .
Only Aunt Jamesina and Phil remain normal .
Thanks to them , everybody be soon sit at ease , even Anne .
Priscilla come down , apronless and smudgeless , Stella reduce her corner to decency , and Phil save the situation by a stream of ready small talk .
Mrs. Gardner be tall and thin and handsome , exquisitely gown , cordial with a cordiality that seem a trifle force .
Aline Gardner be a young edition of her mother , lack the cordiality .
She endeavor to be nice , but succeed only in be haughty and patronizing .
Dorothy Gardner be slim and jolly and rather tomboyish .
Anne know she be Roy 's favorite sister and warm to her .
She would have look very much like Roy if she have have dreamy dark eye instead of roguish hazel one .
Thanks to her and Phil , the call really go off very well , except for a slight sense of strain in the atmosphere and two rather untoward incident .
Rusty and Joseph , leave to themselves , begin a game of chase , and sprang madly into Mrs. Gardner 's silken lap and out of it in their wild career .
Mrs. Gardner lift her lorgnette and gaze after their flying form a if she have never see cat before , and Anne , choke back slightly nervous laughter , apologize a best she could .
`` You be fond of cat ? ''
say Mrs. Gardner , with a slight intonation of tolerant wonder .
Anne , despite her affection for Rusty , be not especially fond of cat , but Mrs. Gardner 's tone annoy her .
Inconsequently she remember that Mrs. John Blythe be so fond of cat that she keep as many a her husband would allow .
`` They ARE adorable animal , be n't they ? ''
she say wickedly .
`` I have never like cat , '' say Mrs. Gardner remotely .
`` I love them , '' say Dorothy .
`` They be so nice and selfish .
Dogs be TOO good and unselfish .
They make me feel uncomfortable .
But cat be gloriously human . ''
`` You have two delightful old china dog there .
May I look at them closely ? ''
say Aline , cross the room towards the fireplace and thereby become the unconscious cause of the other accident .
Picking up Magog , she sit down on the cushion under which be secrete Priscilla 's chocolate cake .
Priscilla and Anne exchange agonized glance but could do nothing .
The stately Aline continue to sit on the cushion and discuss china dog until the time of departure .
Dorothy linger behind a moment to squeeze Anne 's hand and whisper impulsively .
`` I KNOW you and I be go to be chum .
Oh , Roy have tell me all about you .
I 'm the only one of the family he tell thing to , poor boy -- nobody COULD confide in mamma and Aline , you know .
What glorious time you girls must have here !
Wo n't you let me come often and have a share in them ? ''
`` Come as often a you like , '' Anne respond heartily , thankful that one of Roy 's sister be likable .
She would never like Aline , so much be certain ; and Aline would never like her , though Mrs. Gardner might be win .
Altogether , Anne sigh with relief when the ordeal be over . ''
` Of all sad word of tongue or pen The sad be it might have be , ' '' quote Priscilla tragically , lift the cushion .
`` This cake be now what you might call a flat failure .
And the cushion be likewise ruin .
Never tell me that Friday be n't unlucky . ''
`` People who send word they be come on Saturday should n't come on Friday , '' say Aunt Jamesina .
`` I fancy it be Roy 's mistake , '' say Phil .
`` That boy be n't really responsible for what he say when he talk to Anne .
Where IS Anne ? ''
Anne have go upstairs .
She felt oddly like cry .
But she make herself laugh instead .
Rusty and Joseph have be TOO awful !
And Dorothy WAS a dear .
Chapter XXXVII Full-fledged B.A . 's `` I wish I be dead , or that it be tomorrow night , '' groan Phil .
`` If you live long enough both wish will come true , '' say Anne calmly .
`` It 's easy for you to be serene .
You 're at home in Philosophy .
I 'm not -- and when I think of that horrible paper tomorrow I quail .
If I should fail in it what would Jo say ? ''
`` You wo n't fail .
How do you get on in Greek today ? ''
`` I do n't know .
Perhaps it be a good paper and perhaps it be bad enough to make Homer turn over in his grave .
I 've study and mull over notebooks until I 'm incapable of form an opinion of anything .
How thankful little Phil will be when all this examinating be over . ''
`` Examinating ?
I never hear such a word . ''
`` Well , have n't I as good a right to make a word a any one else ? ''
demand Phil .
`` Words be n't make -- they grow , '' say Anne .
`` Never mind -- I begin faintly to discern clear water ahead where no examination breaker loom .
Girls , do you -- can you realize that our Redmond Life be almost over ? ''
`` I ca n't , '' say Anne , sorrowfully .
`` It seem just yesterday that Pris and I be alone in that crowd of Freshmen at Redmond .
And now we be Seniors in our final examination . '' ''
` Potent , wise , and reverend Seniors , ' '' quote Phil .
`` Do you suppose we really be any wise than when we come to Redmond ? ''
`` You do n't act a if you be by time , '' say Aunt Jamesina severely .
`` Oh , Aunt Jimsie , have n't we be pretty good girl , take u by and large , these three winter you 've mother u ? ''
plead Phil .
`` You 've be four of the dear , sweet , good girl that ever go together through college , '' aver Aunt Jamesina , who never spoil a compliment by misplaced economy .
`` But I mistrust you have n't any too much sense yet .
It 's not to be expect , of course .
Experience teach sense .
You ca n't learn it in a college course .
You 've be to college four year and I never be , but I know heaps more than you do , young lady . '' ''
` There be lot of thing that never go by rule , There 's a powerful pile o ' knowledge That you never get at college , There be heap of thing you never learn at school , ' '' quote Stella .
`` Have you learn anything at Redmond except dead language and geometry and such trash ? ''
queried Aunt Jamesina .
`` Oh , yes .
I think we have , Aunty , '' protest Anne .
`` We 've learn the truth of what Professor Woodleigh tell u last Philomathic , '' say Phil .
`` He say , ` Humor be the spicy condiment in the feast of existence .
Laugh at your mistake but learn from them , joke over your trouble but gather strength from them , make a jest of your difficulty but overcome them . '
Is n't that worth learning , Aunt Jimsie ? ''
`` Yes , it be , dearie .
When you 've learn to laugh at the thing that should be laugh at , and not to laugh at those that should n't , you 've get wisdom and understanding . ''
`` What have you get out of your Redmond course , Anne ? ''
murmur Priscilla aside .
`` I think , '' say Anne slowly , `` that I really have learn to look upon each little hindrance a a jest and each great one a the foreshadowing of victory .
Summing up , I think that be what Redmond have give me . ''
`` I shall have to fall back on another Professor Woodleigh quotation to express what it have do for me , '' say Priscilla .
`` You remember that he say in his address , ` There be so much in the world for u all if we only have the eye to see it , and the heart to love it , and the hand to gather it to ourselves -- so much in men and woman , so much in art and literature , so much everywhere in which to delight , and for which to be thankful . '
I think Redmond have teach me that in some measure , Anne . ''
`` Judging from what you all , say '' remark Aunt Jamesina , `` the sum and substance be that you can learn -- if you 've get natural gumption enough -- in four year at college what it would take about twenty year of living to teach you .
Well , that justify high education in my opinion .
It 's a matter I be always dubious about before . ''
`` But what about people who have n't natural gumption , Aunt Jimsie ? ''
`` People who have n't natural gumption never learn , '' retort Aunt Jamesina , `` neither in college nor life .
If they live to be a hundred they really do n't know anything more than when they be bear .
It 's their misfortune not their fault , poor soul .
But those of u who have some gumption should duly thank the Lord for it . ''
`` Will you please define what gumption be , Aunt Jimsie ? ''
ask Phil .
`` No , I wo n't , young woman .
Any one who have gumption know what it be , and any one who have n't can never know what it be .
So there be no need of define it . ''
The busy day fly by and examination be over .
Anne take High Honors in English .
Priscilla take Honors in Classics , and Phil in Mathematics .
Stella obtain a good all-round showing .
Then come Convocation .
`` This be what I would once have call an epoch in my life , '' say Anne , a she take Roy 's violet out of their box and gaze at them thoughtfully .
She mean to carry them , of course , but her eye wander to another box on her table .
It be fill with lilies-of-the-valley , a fresh and fragrant a those which bloom in the Green Gables yard when June come to Avonlea .
Gilbert Blythe 's card lay beside it .
Anne wonder why Gilbert should have send her flower for Convocation .
She have see very little of him during the past winter .
He have come to Patty 's Place only one Friday evening since the Christmas holiday , and they rarely meet elsewhere .
She know he be study very hard , aim at High Honors and the Cooper Prize , and he take little part in the social doings of Redmond .
Anne 's own winter have be quite gay socially .
She have see a good deal of the Gardners ; she and Dorothy be very intimate ; college circle expect the announcement of her engagement to Roy any day .
Anne expect it herself .
Yet just before she leave Patty 's Place for Convocation she fling Roy 's violet aside and put Gilbert 's lilies-of-the-valley in their place .
She could not have tell why she do it .
Somehow , old Avonlea day and dream and friendship seem very close to her in this attainment of her long-cherished ambition .
She and Gilbert have once picturedout merrily the day on which they should be cap and gown graduate in Arts .
The wonderful day have come and Roy 's violet have no place in it .
Only her old friend 's flower seem to belong to this fruition of old-blossoming hope which he have once share .
For year this day have beckon and allure to her ; but when it come the one single , keen , abide memory it leave with her be not that of the breathless moment when the stately president of Redmond give her cap and diploma and hail her B.A . ; it be not of the flash in Gilbert 's eye when he saw her lily , nor the puzzled pained glance Roy give her a he pass her on the platform .
It be not of Aline Gardner 's condescending congratulation , or Dorothy 's ardent , impulsive good wish .
It be of one strange , unaccountable pang that spoil this long-expected day for her and leave in it a certain faint but endure flavor of bitterness .
The Arts graduate give a graduation dance that night .
When Anne dress for it she toss aside the pearl bead she usually wear and take from her trunk the small box that have come to Green Gables on Christmas day .
In it be a thread-like gold chain with a tiny pink enamel heart a a pendant .
On the accompany card be write , `` With all good wish from your old chum , Gilbert . ''
Anne , laugh over the memory the enamel heart conjure up the fatal day when Gilbert have call her `` Carrots '' and vainly try to make his peace with a pink candy heart , have write him a nice little note of thanks .
But she have never wear the trinket .
Tonight she fasten it about her white throat with a dreamy smile .
She and Phil walk to Redmond together .
Anne walk in silence ; Phil chatter of many thing .
Suddenly she say , `` I hear today that Gilbert Blythe 's engagement to Christine Stuart be to be announce as soon a Convocation be over .
Did you hear anything of it ? ''
`` No , '' say Anne .
`` I think it 's true , '' say Phil lightly .
Anne do not speak .
In the darkness she felt her face burning .
She slip her hand inside her collar and catch at the gold chain .
One energetic twist and it give way .
Anne thrust the broken trinket into her pocket .
Her hand be tremble and her eye be smart .
But she be the gay of all the gay reveller that night , and tell Gilbert unregretfully that her card be full when he come to ask her for a dance .
Afterwards , when she sit with the girl before the die ember at Patty 's Place , remove the spring chilliness from their satin skin , none chat more blithely than she of the day 's event .
`` Moody Spurgeon MacPherson call here tonight after you leave , '' say Aunt Jamesina , who have sit up to keep the fire on .
`` He do n't know about the graduation dance .
That boy ought to sleep with a rubber band around his head to train his ear not to stick out .
I have a beau once who do that and it improve him immensely .
It be I who suggest it to him and he take my advice , but he never forgive me for it . ''
`` Moody Spurgeon be a very serious young man , '' yawn Priscilla .
`` He be concern with graver matter than his ear .
He be go to be a minister , you know . ''
`` Well , I suppose the Lord do n't regard the ear of a man , '' say Aunt Jamesina gravely , drop all further criticism of Moody Spurgeon .
Aunt Jamesina have a proper respect for the cloth even in the case of an unfledged parson .
Chapter XXXVIII False Dawn `` Just imagine -- this night week I 'll be in Avonlea -- delightful thought ! ''
say Anne , bend over the box in which she be pack Mrs. Rachel Lynde 's quilt .
`` But just imagine -- this night week I 'll be go forever from Patty 's Place -- horrible thought ! ''
`` I wonder if the ghost of all our laughter will echo through the maiden dream of Miss Patty and Miss Maria , '' speculate Phil .
Miss Patty and Miss Maria be come home , after have trot over most of the habitable globe .
`` We 'll be back the second week in May '' write Miss Patty .
`` I expect Patty 's Place will seem rather small after the Hall of the Kings at Karnak , but I never do like big place to live in .
And I 'll be glad enough to be home again .
When you start travel late in life you 're apt to do too much of it because you know you have n't much time leave , and it 's a thing that grow on you .
I 'm afraid Maria will never be content again . ''
`` I shall leave here my fancy and dream to bless the next comer , '' say Anne , look around the blue room wistfully -- her pretty blue room where she have spend three such happy year .
She have kneel at it window to pray and have bent from it to watch the sunset behind the pine .
She have hear the autumn raindrops beat against it and have welcome the spring robins at it sill .
She wonder if old dream could haunt room -- if , when one leave forever the room where she have joy and suffer and laugh and wept , something of her , intangible and invisible , yet nonetheless real , do not remain behind like a voiceful memory .
`` I think , '' say Phil , `` that a room where one dream and grief and rejoices and live becomes inseparably connect with those process and acquire a personality of it own .
I be sure if I come into this room fifty year from now it would say ` Anne , Anne ' to me .
What nice time we 've have here , honey !
What chat and joke and good chummy jamboree !
Oh , dear me !
I 'm to marry Jo in June and I know I will be rapturously happy .
But just now I feel a if I want this lovely Redmond life to go on forever . ''
`` I 'm unreasonable enough just now to wish that , too , '' admit Anne .
`` No matter what deeper joy may come to u later on we 'll never again have just the same delightful , irresponsible existence we 've have here .
It 's over forever , Phil . ''
`` What be you go to do with Rusty ? ''
ask Phil , a that privilege pussy pad into the room .
`` I be go to take him home with me and Joseph and the Sarah-cat , '' announce Aunt Jamesina , follow Rusty .
`` It would be a shame to separate those cat now that they have learn to live together .
It 's a hard lesson for cat and human to learn . ''
`` I 'm sorry to part with Rusty , '' say Anne regretfully , `` but it would be no use to take him to Green Gables .
Marilla detests cat , and Davy would tease his life out .
Besides , I do n't suppose I 'll be home very long .
I 've be offer the principalship of the Summerside High School . ''
`` Are you go to accept it ? ''
ask Phil .
`` I -- I have n't decide yet , '' answer Anne , with a confused flush .
Phil nod understandingly .
Naturally Anne 's plan could not be settle until Roy have speak .
He would soon -- there be no doubt of that .
And there be no doubt that Anne would say `` yes '' when he say `` Will you please ? ''
Anne herself regard the state of affair with a seldom-ruffled complacency .
She be deeply in love with Roy .
True , it be not just what she have imagine love to be .
But be anything in life , Anne ask herself wearily , like one 's imagination of it ?
It be the old diamond disillusion of childhood repeat -- the same disappointment she have felt when she have first see the chill sparkle instead of the purple splendor she have anticipate .
`` That 's not my idea of a diamond , '' she have say .
But Roy be a dear fellow and they would be very happy together , even if some indefinable zest be miss out of life .
When Roy come down that even and ask Anne to walk in the park every one at Patty 's Place know what he have come to say ; and every one knew , or think they know , what Anne 's answer would be .
`` Anne be a very fortunate girl , '' say Aunt Jamesina .
`` I suppose so , '' say Stella , shrug her shoulder .
`` Roy be a nice fellow and all that .
But there 's really nothing in him . ''
`` That sound very like a jealous remark , Stella Maynard , '' say Aunt Jamesina rebukingly .
`` It do -- but I be not jealous , '' say Stella calmly .
`` I love Anne and I like Roy .
Everybody say she be make a brilliant match , and even Mrs. Gardner think her charming now .
It all sound a if it be make in heaven , but I have my doubt .
Make the most of that , Aunt Jamesina . ''
Roy ask Anne to marry him in the little pavilion on the harbor shore where they have talk on the rainy day of their first meeting .
Anne think it very romantic that he should have choose that spot .
And his proposal be a beautifully word a if he have copy it , a one of Ruby Gillis ' lover have do , out of a Deportment of Courtship and Marriage .
The whole effect be quite flawless .
And it be also sincere .
There be no doubt that Roy mean what he say .
There be no false note to jar the symphony .
Anne felt that she ought to be thrill from head to foot .
But she be n't ; she be horribly cool .
When Roy pause for his answer she open her lip to say her fateful yes .
And then -- she find herself tremble a if she be reel back from a precipice .
To her come one of those moment when we realize , a by a blinding flash of illumination , more than all our previous year have teach u .
She pull her hand from Roy 's .
`` Oh , I ca n't marry you -- I ca n't -- I ca n't , '' she cry , wildly .
Roy turn pale -- and also look rather foolish .
He have -- small blame to him -- felt very sure .
`` What do you mean ? ''
he stammer .
`` I mean that I ca n't marry you , '' repeat Anne desperately .
`` I think I could -- but I ca n't . ''
`` Why ca n't you ? ''
Roy ask more calmly .
`` Because -- I do n't care enough for you . ''
A crimson streak come into Roy 's face .
`` So you 've just be amuse yourself these two year ? ''
he say slowly .
`` No , no , I have n't , '' gasp poor Anne .
Oh , how could she explain ?
She COULD N'T explain .
There be some thing that can not be explain .
`` I do think I care -- truly I do -- but I know now I do n't . ''
`` You have ruin my life , '' say Roy bitterly .
`` Forgive me , '' plead Anne miserably , with hot cheek and sting eye .
Roy turn away and stand for a few minute look out seaward .
When he come back to Anne , he be very pale again .
`` You can give me no hope ? ''
he say .
Anne shake her head mutely .
`` Then -- good-bye , '' say Roy .
`` I ca n't understand it -- I ca n't believe you be not the woman I 've believe you to be .
But reproach be idle between u .
You be the only woman I can ever love .
I thank you for your friendship , at least .
Good-bye , Anne . ''
`` Good-bye , '' falter Anne .
When Roy have go she sit for a long time in the pavilion , watch a white mist creep subtly and remorselessly landward up the harbor .
It be her hour of humiliation and self-contempt and shame .
Their wave go over her .
And yet , underneath it all , be a queer sense of recover freedom .
She slip into Patty 's Place in the dusk and escape to her room .
But Phil be there on the window seat .
`` Wait , '' say Anne , flush to anticipate the scene .
`` Wait til you hear what I have to say .
Phil , Roy ask me to marry him-and I refuse . ''
`` You -- you REFUSED him ? ''
say Phil blankly .
`` Yes . ''
`` Anne Shirley , be you in your sens ? ''
`` I think so , '' say Anne wearily .
`` Oh , Phil , do n't scold me .
You do n't understand . ''
`` I certainly do n't understand .
You 've encourage Roy Gardner in every way for two year -- and now you tell me you 've refuse him .
Then you 've just be flirt scandalously with him .
Anne , I could n't have believe it of YOU . ''
`` I WAS N'T flirt with him -- I honestly think I care up to the last minute -- and then -- well , I just know I NEVER could marry him . ''
`` I suppose , '' say Phil cruelly , `` that you intend to marry him for his money , and then your well self rise up and prevent you . ''
`` I DID N'T .
I never think about his money .
Oh , I ca n't explain it to you any more than I could to him . ''
`` Well , I certainly think you have treat Roy shamefully , '' say Phil in exasperation .
`` He 's handsome and clever and rich and good .
What more do you want ? ''
`` I want some one who BELONGS in my life .
He do n't .
I be sweep off my foot at first by his good look and knack of pay romantic compliment ; and later on I think I MUST be in love because he be my dark-eyed ideal . ''
`` I be bad enough for not know my own mind , but you be bad , '' say Phil . ''
I DO know my own mind , '' protest Anne .
`` The trouble be , my mind change and then I have to get acquaint with it all over again . ''
`` Well , I suppose there be no use in say anything to you . ''
`` There be no need , Phil .
I 'm in the dust .
This have spoil everything backwards .
I can never think of Redmond day without recall the humiliation of this evening .
Roy despise me -- and you despise me -- and I despise myself . ''
`` You poor darling , '' say Phil , melt .
`` Just come here and let me comfort you .
I 've no right to scold you .
I 'd have marry Alec or Alonzo if I have n't meet Jo .
Oh , Anne , thing be so mixed-up in real life .
They be n't clear-cut and trim off , a they be in novel . ''
`` I hope that NO one will ever again ask me to marry him as long a I live , '' sob poor Anne , devoutly believe that she mean it .
Chapter XXXIX Deals with Weddings Anne felt that life partook of the nature of an anticlimax during the first few week after her return to Green Gables .
She miss the merry comradeship of Patty 's Place .
She have dream some brilliant dream during the past winter and now they lay in the dust around her .
In her present mood of self-disgust , she could not immediately begin dream again .
And she discover that , while solitude with dream be glorious , solitude without them have few charm .
She have not see Roy again after their painful parting in the park pavilion ; but Dorothy come to see her before she leave Kingsport .
`` I 'm awfully sorry you wo n't marry Roy , '' she say .
`` I do want you for a sister .
But you be quite right .
He would bore you to death .
I love him , and he be a dear sweet boy , but really he be n't a bit interesting .
He look a if he ought to be , but he be n't . ''
`` This wo n't spoil OUR friendship , will it , Dorothy ? ''
Anne have ask wistfully .
`` No , indeed .
You 're too good to lose .
If I ca n't have you for a sister I mean to keep you a a chum anyway .
And do n't fret over Roy .
He be feel terribly just now -- I have to listen to his outpouring every day -- but he 'll get over it .
He always do . ''
`` Oh -- ALWAYS ? ''
say Anne with a slight change of voice .
`` So he have ` got over it ' before ? ''
`` Dear me , yes , '' say Dorothy frankly .
`` Twice before .
And he rave to me just the same both time .
Not that the others actually refuse him -- they simply announce their engagement to some one else .
Of course , when he meet you he vow to me that he have never really love before -- that the previous affair have be merely boyish fancy .
But I do n't think you need worry . ''
Anne decide not to worry .
Her feeling be a mixture of relief and resentment .
Roy have certainly tell her she be the only one he have ever love .
No doubt he believe it .
But it be a comfort to feel that she have not , in all likelihood , ruin his life .
There be other goddess , and Roy , accord to Dorothy , must needs be worship at some shrine .
Nevertheless , life be strip of several more illusion , and Anne begin to think drearily that it seem rather bare .
She come down from the porch gable on the evening of her return with a sorrowful face .
`` What have happen to the old Snow Queen , Marilla ? ''
`` Oh , I know you 'd feel bad over that , '' say Marilla .
`` I felt bad myself .
That tree be there ever since I be a young girl .
It blow down in the big gale we have in March .
It be rotten at the core . ''
`` I 'll miss it so , '' grieve Anne .
`` The porch gable do n't seem the same room without it .
I 'll never look from it window again without a sense of loss .
And oh , I never come home to Green Gables before that Diana be n't here to welcome me . ''
`` Diana have something else to think of just now , '' say Mrs. Lynde significantly .
`` Well , tell me all the Avonlea news , '' say Anne , sit down on the porch step , where the evening sunshine fell over her hair in a fine golden rain .
`` There be n't much news except what we 've write you , '' say Mrs. Lynde .
`` I suppose you have n't hear that Simon Fletcher break his leg last week .
It 's a great thing for his family .
They 're get a hundred thing do that they 've always want to do but could n't as long a he be about , the old crank . ''
`` He come of an aggravate family , '' remark Marilla .
`` Aggravating ?
Well , rather !
His mother use to get up in prayer-meeting and tell all her child 's shortcoming and ask prayer for them .
` Course it make them mad , and bad than ever . ''
`` You have n't tell Anne the news about Jane , '' suggest Marilla .
`` Oh , Jane , '' sniff Mrs. Lynde .
`` Well , '' she concede grudgingly , `` Jane Andrews be home from the West -- come last week -- and she 's go to be marry to a Winnipeg millionaire .
You may be sure Mrs. Harmon lose no time in tell it far and wide . ''
`` Dear old Jane -- I 'm so glad , '' say Anne heartily .
`` She deserve the good thing of life . ''
`` Oh , I ai n't say anything against Jane .
She 's a nice enough girl .
But she be n't in the millionaire class , and you 'll find there 's not much to recommend that man but his money , that 's what .
Mrs. Harmon say he 's an Englishman who have make money in mine but I believe he 'll turn out to be a Yankee .
He certainly must have money , for he have just shower Jane with jewelry .
Her engagement ring be a diamond cluster so big that it look like a plaster on Jane 's fat paw . ''
Mrs. Lynde could not keep some bitterness out of her tone .
Here be Jane Andrews , that plain little plodder , engage to a millionaire , while Anne , it seem , be not yet bespeak by any one , rich or poor .
And Mrs. Harmon Andrews do brag insufferably .
`` What have Gilbert Blythe be do to at college ? ''
ask Marilla .
`` I saw him when he come home last week , and he be so pale and thin I hardly know him . ''
`` He study very hard last winter , '' say Anne .
`` You know he take High Honors in Classics and the Cooper Prize .
It have n't be take for five year !
So I think he 's rather run down .
We 're all a little tired . ''
`` Anyhow , you 're a B.A . and Jane Andrews be n't and never will be , '' say Mrs. Lynde , with gloomy satisfaction .
A few evening later Anne go down to see Jane , but the latter be away in Charlottetown -- `` get sew do , '' Mrs. Harmon inform Anne proudly .
`` Of course an Avonlea dressmaker would n't do for Jane under the circumstance . ''
`` I 've hear something very nice about Jane , '' say Anne .
`` Yes , Jane have do pretty well , even if she be n't a B.A . , '' say Mrs. Harmon , with a slight toss of her head .
`` Mr. Inglis be worth million , and they 're go to Europe on their wedding tour .
When they come back they 'll live in a perfect mansion of marble in Winnipeg .
Jane have only one trouble -- she can cook so well and her husband wo n't let her cook .
He be so rich he hire his cooking do .
They 're go to keep a cook and two other maid and a coachman and a man-of-all-work .
But what about YOU , Anne ?
I do n't hear anything of your be marry , after all your college-going . ''
`` Oh , '' laugh Anne , `` I be go to be an old maid .
I really ca n't find any one to suit me . ''
It be rather wicked of her .
She deliberately mean to remind Mrs. Andrews that if she become an old maid it be not because she have not have at least one chance of marriage .
But Mrs. Harmon take swift revenge .
`` Well , the over-particular girl generally get leave , I notice .
And what 's this I hear about Gilbert Blythe be engage to a Miss Stuart ?
Charlie Sloane tell me she be perfectly beautiful .
Is it true ? ''
`` I do n't know if it be true that he be engage to Miss Stuart , '' reply Anne , with Spartan composure , `` but it be certainly true that she be very lovely . ''
`` I once think you and Gilbert would have make a match of it , '' say Mrs. Harmon .
`` If you do n't take care , Anne , all of your beau will slip through your finger . ''
Anne decide not to continue her duel with Mrs. Harmon .
You could not fence with an antagonist who meet rapier thrust with blow of battle axe .
`` Since Jane be away , '' she say , rise haughtily , `` I do n't think I can stay longer this morning .
I 'll come down when she come home . ''
`` Do , '' say Mrs. Harmon effusively .
`` Jane be n't a bit proud .
She just mean to associate with her old friends the same a ever .
She 'll be real glad to see you . ''
Jane 's millionaire arrive the last of May and carry her off in a blaze of splendor .
Mrs. Lynde be spitefully gratify to find that Mr. Inglis be every day of forty , and short and thin and grayish .
Mrs. Lynde do not spare him in her enumeration of his shortcoming , you may be sure .
`` It will take all his gold to gild a pill like him , that 's what , '' say Mrs. Rachel solemnly .
`` He look kind and good-hearted , '' say Anne loyally , `` and I 'm sure he think the world of Jane . ''
`` Humph ! ''
say Mrs. Rachel .
Phil Gordon be marry the next week and Anne go over to Bolingbroke to be her bridesmaid .
Phil make a dainty fairy of a bride , and the Rev . Jo be so radiant in his happiness that nobody think him plain .
`` We 're go for a lover ' saunter through the land of Evangeline , '' say Phil , `` and then we 'll settle down on Patterson Street .
Mother think it be terrible -- she think Jo might at least take a church in a decent place .
But the wilderness of the Patterson slum will blossom like the rise for me if Jo be there .
Oh , Anne , I 'm so happy my heart ache with it . ''
Anne be always glad in the happiness of her friend ; but it be sometimes a little lonely to be surround everywhere by a happiness that be not your own .
And it be just the same when she go back to Avonlea .
This time it be Diana who be bath in the wonderful glory that come to a woman when her first-born be laid beside her .
Anne look at the white young mother with a certain awe that have never enter into her feeling for Diana before .
Could this pale woman with the rapture in her eye be the little black-curled , rosy-cheeked Diana she have play with in vanished schooldays ?
It give her a queer desolate feeling that she herself somehow belong only in those past year and have no business in the present at all .
`` Is n't he perfectly beautiful ? ''
say Diana proudly .
The little fat fellow be absurdly like Fred -- just a round , just a red .
Anne really could not say conscientiously that she think him beautiful , but she vow sincerely that he be sweet and kissable and altogether delightful .
`` Before he come I want a girl , so that I could call her ANNE , '' say Diana .
`` But now that little Fred be here I would n't exchange him for a million girl .
He just COULD N'T have be anything but his own precious self . '' ''
` Every little baby be the sweetest and the best , ' '' quote Mrs. Allan gaily .
`` If little Anne HAD come you 'd have felt just the same about her . ''
Mrs. Allan be visit in Avonlea , for the first time since leave it .
She be a gay and sweet and sympathetic a ever .
Her old girl friend have welcome her back rapturously .
The reign minister 's wife be an estimable lady , but she be not exactly a kindred spirit .
`` I can hardly wait till he get old enough to talk , '' sigh Diana .
`` I just long to hear him say ` mother . '
And oh , I 'm determined that his first memory of me shall be a nice one .
The first memory I have of my mother be of her slap me for something I have do .
I be sure I deserve it , and mother be always a good mother and I love her dearly .
But I do wish my first memory of her be nicer . ''
`` I have just one memory of my mother and it be the sweet of all my memory , '' say Mrs. Allan .
`` I be five year old , and I have be allow to go to school one day with my two old sister .
When school come out my sister go home in different group , each suppose I be with the other .
Instead I have run off with a little girl I have play with at recess .
We go to her home , which be near the school , and begin make mud pie .
We be have a glorious time when my old sister arrive , breathless and angry . ''
` You naughty girl '' she cry , snatch my reluctant hand and drag me along with her .
` Come home this minute .
Oh , you 're go to catch it !
Mother be awful cross .
She be go to give you a good whipping . '
`` I have never be whip .
Dread and terror fill my poor little heart .
I have never be so miserable in my life a I be on that walk home .
I have not mean to be naughty .
Phemy Cameron have ask me to go home with her and I have not know it be wrong to go .
And now I be to be whip for it .
When we get home my sister drag me into the kitchen where mother be sit by the fire in the twilight .
My poor wee leg be tremble so that I could hardly stand .
And mother -- mother just take me up in her arm , without one word of rebuke or harshness , kiss me and hold me close to her heart . '
I be so frightened you be lose , darling , ' she say tenderly .
I could see the love shining in her eye a she look down on me .
She never scold or reproach me for what I have do -- only tell me I must never go away again without ask permission .
She die very soon afterwards .
That be the only memory I have of her .
Is n't it a beautiful one ? ''
Anne felt lonelier than ever a she walk home , go by way of the Birch Path and Willowmere .
She have not walk that way for many moon .
It be a darkly-purple bloomy night .
The air be heavy with blossom fragrance -- almost too heavy .
The cloyed sens recoil from it a from an overfull cup .
The birch of the path have grow from the fairy sapling of old to big tree .
Everything have change .
Anne felt that she would be glad when the summer be over and she be away at work again .
Perhaps life would not seem so empty then . ''
` I 've try the world -- it wear no more The coloring of romance it wear , ' '' sigh Anne -- and be straightway much comfort by the romance in the idea of the world be denude of romance !
Chapter XL A Book of Revelation The Irvings come back to Echo Lodge for the summer , and Anne spend a happy three week there in July .
Miss Lavendar have not change ; Charlotta the Fourth be a very grown-up young lady now , but still adore Anne sincerely .
`` When all 's say and do , Miss Shirley , ma'am , I have n't see any one in Boston that 's equal to you , '' she say frankly .
Paul be almost grow up , too .
He be sixteen , his chestnut curl have give place to close-cropped brown lock , and he be more interested in football than fairy .
But the bond between him and his old teacher still hold .
Kindred spirit alone do not change with change year .
It be a wet , bleak , cruel evening in July when Anne come back to Green Gables .
One of the fierce summer storm which sometimes sweep over the gulf be ravage the sea .
As Anne come in the first raindrop dash against the pane .
`` Was that Paul who bring you home ? ''
ask Marilla .
`` Why do n't you make him stay all night .
It 's go to be a wild evening . ''
`` He 'll reach Echo Lodge before the rain get very heavy , I think .
Anyway , he want to go back tonight .
Well , I 've have a splendid visit , but I 'm glad to see you dear folk again .
` East , west , hame 's best . '
Davy , have you be grow again lately ? ''
`` I 've grow a whole inch since you leave , '' say Davy proudly .
`` I 'm as tall a Milty Boulter now .
Ai n't I glad .
He 'll have to stop crow about be big .
Say , Anne , do you know that Gilbert Blythe be die ? ''
Anne stand quite silent and motionless , look at Davy .
Her face have go so white that Marilla think she be go to faint .
`` Davy , hold your tongue , '' say Mrs. Rachel angrily .
`` Anne , do n't look like that -- DO N'T LOOK LIKE THAT !
We do n't mean to tell you so suddenly . ''
`` Is -- it -- true ? ''
ask Anne in a voice that be not hers .
`` Gilbert be very ill , '' say Mrs. Lynde gravely .
`` He take down with typhoid fever just after you leave for Echo Lodge .
Did you never hear of it ? ''
`` No , '' say that unknown voice .
`` It be a very bad case from the start .
The doctor say he 'd be terribly run down .
They 've a trained nurse and everything 's be do .
DO N'T look like that , Anne .
While there 's life there 's hope . ''
`` Mr. Harrison be here this evening and he say they have no hope of him , '' reiterate Davy .
Marilla , look old and worn and tired , get up and march Davy grimly out of the kitchen .
`` Oh , DO N'T look so , dear , '' say Mrs. Rachel , put her kind old arm about the pallid girl .
`` I have n't give up hope , indeed I have n't .
He 's get the Blythe constitution in his favor , that 's what . ''
Anne gently put Mrs. Lynde 's arm away from her , walk blindly across the kitchen , through the hall , up the stair to her old room .
At it window she kneel down , star out unseeingly .
It be very dark .
The rain be beat down over the shivering field .
The Haunted Woods be full of the groan of mighty tree wring in the tempest , and the air throb with the thunderous crash of billow on the distant shore .
And Gilbert be die !
There be a book of Revelation in every one 's life , a there be in the Bible .
Anne read hers that bitter night , a she keep her agonize vigil through the hour of storm and darkness .
She love Gilbert -- have always love him !
She know that now .
She know that she could no more cast him out of her life without agony than she could have cut off her right hand and cast it from her .
And the knowledge have come too late -- too late even for the bitter solace of be with him at the last .
If she have not be so blind -- so foolish -- she would have have the right to go to him now .
But he would never know that she love him -- he would go away from this life think that she do not care .
Oh , the black year of emptiness stretch before her !
She could not live through them -- she could not !
She cower down by her window and wish , for the first time in her gay young life , that she could die , too .
If Gilbert go away from her , without one word or sign or message , she could not live .
Nothing be of any value without him .
She belong to him and he to her .
In her hour of supreme agony she have no doubt of that .
He do not love Christine Stuart -- never have love Christine Stuart .
Oh , what a fool she have be not to realize what the bond be that have hold her to Gilbert -- to think that the flattered fancy she have felt for Roy Gardner have be love .
And now she must pay for her folly a for a crime .
Mrs. Lynde and Marilla crept to her door before they go to bed , shake their head doubtfully at each other over the silence , and go away .
The storm rag all night , but when the dawn come it be spend .
Anne saw a fairy fringe of light on the skirt of darkness .
Soon the eastern hilltop have a fire-shot ruby rim .
The cloud roll themselves away into great , soft , white mass on the horizon ; the sky gleam blue and silvery .
A hush fell over the world .
Anne rise from her knee and crept downstairs .
The freshness of the rain-wind blew against her white face a she go out into the yard , and cool her dry , burn eye .
A merry rollick whistle be lilt up the lane .
A moment later Pacifique Buote come in sight .
Anne 's physical strength suddenly fail her .
If she have not clutch at a low willow bough she would have fall .
Pacifique be George Fletcher 's hired man , and George Fletcher live next door to the Blythes .
Mrs. Fletcher be Gilbert 's aunt .
Pacifique would know if -- if -- Pacifique would know what there be to be know .
Pacifique stride sturdily on along the red lane , whistle .
He do not see Anne .
She make three futile attempt to call him .
He be almost past before she succeed in make her quiver lip call , `` Pacifique ! ''
Pacifique turn with a grin and a cheerful good morning .
`` Pacifique , '' say Anne faintly , `` do you come from George Fletcher 's this morning ? ''
`` Sure , '' say Pacifique amiably .
`` I get de word la ' night dat my fader , he be seeck .
It be so stormy dat I could n't go den , so I start vair early dis mornin ' .
I 'm goin ' troo de wood for short cut . ''
`` Did you hear how Gilbert Blythe be this morning ? ''
Anne 's desperation drive her to the question .
Even the bad would be more endurable than this hideous suspense .
`` He 's good , '' say Pacifique .
`` He get de turn la ' night .
De doctor say he 'll be all right now dis soon while .
Had close shave , dough !
Dat boy , he jus ' keel himself at college .
Well , I mus ' hurry .
De old man , he 'll be in hurry to see me . ''
Pacifique resume his walk and his whistle .
Anne gaze after him with eye where joy be drive out the strained anguish of the night .
He be a very lank , very ragged , very homely youth .
But in her sight he be as beautiful a those who bring good tidings on the mountain .
Never , as long a she live , would Anne see Pacifique 's brown , round , black-eyed face without a warm remembrance of the moment when he have give to her the oil of joy for mourn .
Long after Pacifique 's gay whistle have fade into the phantom of music and then into silence far up under the maple of Lover 's Lane Anne stand under the willow , taste the poignant sweetness of life when some great dread have be remove from it .
The morning be a cup fill with mist and glamor .
In the corner near her be a rich surprise of new-blown , crystal-dewed rose .
The trill and trickle of song from the bird in the big tree above her seem in perfect accord with her mood .
A sentence from a very old , very true , very wonderful Book come to her lip , `` Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning . ''
XLI Love Takes Up the Glass of Time `` I 've come up to ask you to go for one of our old-time ramble through September wood and ` over hill where spice grow , ' this afternoon , '' say Gilbert , come suddenly around the porch corner .
`` Suppose we visit Hester Gray 's garden . ''
Anne , sit on the stone step with her lap full of a pale , filmy , green stuff , look up rather blankly .
`` Oh , I wish I could , '' she say slowly , `` but I really ca n't , Gilbert .
I 'm go to Alice Penhallow 's wedding this evening , you know .
I 've get to do something to this dress , and by the time it 's finish I 'll have to get ready .
I 'm so sorry .
I 'd love to go . ''
`` Well , can you go tomorrow afternoon , then ? ''
ask Gilbert , apparently not much disappoint .
`` Yes , I think so . ''
`` In that case I shall hie me home at once to do something I should otherwise have to do tomorrow .
So Alice Penhallow be to be marry tonight .
Three wedding for you in one summer , Anne -- Phil 's , Alice 's , and Jane 's .
I 'll never forgive Jane for not invite me to her wedding . ''
`` You really ca n't blame her when you think of the tremendous Andrews connection who have to be invite .
The house could hardly hold them all .
I be only bidden by grace of be Jane 's old chum -- at least on Jane 's part .
I think Mrs. Harmon 's motive for invite me be to let me see Jane 's surpass gorgeousness . ''
`` Is it true that she wear so many diamond that you could n't tell where the diamond leave off and Jane begin ? ''
Anne laugh .
`` She certainly wear a good many .
What with all the diamond and white satin and tulle and lace and rose and orange blossom , prim little Jane be almost lose to sight .
But she be VERY happy , and so be Mr. Inglis -- and so be Mrs. Harmon . ''
`` Is that the dress you 're go to wear tonight ? ''
ask Gilbert , look down at the fluff and frill .
`` Yes .
Is n't it pretty ?
And I shall wear starflower in my hair .
The Haunted Wood be full of them this summer . ''
Gilbert have a sudden vision of Anne , array in a frilly green gown , with the virginal curve of arm and throat slip out of it , and white star shin against the coil of her ruddy hair .
The vision make him catch his breath .
But he turn lightly away .
`` Well , I 'll be up tomorrow .
Hope you 'll have a nice time tonight . ''
Anne look after him a he stride away , and sigh .
Gilbert be friendly -- very friendly -- far too friendly .
He have come quite often to Green Gables after his recovery , and something of their old comradeship have return .
But Anne no longer find it satisfy .
The rise of love make the blossom of friendship pale and scentless by contrast .
And Anne have again begin to doubt if Gilbert now felt anything for her but friendship .
In the common light of common day her radiant certainty of that rapt morning have fade .
She be haunt by a miserable fear that her mistake could never be rectify .
It be quite likely that it be Christine whom Gilbert love after all .
Perhaps he be even engage to her .
Anne try to put all unsettling hop out of her heart , and reconcile herself to a future where work and ambition must take the place of love .
She could do good , if not noble , work a a teacher ; and the success her little sketch be begin to meet with in certain editorial sanctum augur well for her budding literary dream .
But -- but -- Anne pick up her green dress and sigh again .
When Gilbert come the next afternoon he find Anne wait for him , fresh a the dawn and fair a a star , after all the gaiety of the precede night .
She wear a green dress -- not the one she have wear to the wedding , but an old one which Gilbert have tell her at a Redmond reception he like especially .
It be just the shade of green that bring out the rich tint of her hair , and the starry gray of her eye and the iris-like delicacy of her skin .
Gilbert , glance at her sideways a they walk along a shadowy woodpath , think she have never look so lovely .
Anne , glance sideways at Gilbert , now and then , think how much old he look since his illness .
It be a if he have put boyhood behind him forever .
The day be beautiful and the way be beautiful .
Anne be almost sorry when they reach Hester Gray 's garden , and sit down on the old bench .
But it be beautiful there , too -- as beautiful a it have be on the faraway day of the Golden Picnic , when Diana and Jane and Priscilla and she have find it .
Then it have be lovely with narcissus and violet ; now golden rod have kindle it fairy torch in the corner and aster dot it bluely .
The call of the brook come up through the wood from the valley of birch with all it old allurement ; the mellow air be full of the purr of the sea ; beyond be field rim by fence bleach silvery gray in the sun of many summer , and long hill scarf with the shadow of autumnal cloud ; with the blowing of the west wind old dream return .
`` I think , '' say Anne softly , `` that ` the land where dream come true ' be in the blue haze yonder , over that little valley . ''
`` Have you any unfulfilled dream , Anne ? ''
ask Gilbert .
Something in his tone -- something she have not hear since that miserable evening in the orchard at Patty 's Place -- make Anne 's heart beat wildly .
But she make answer lightly .
`` Of course .
Everybody have .
It would n't do for u to have all our dream fulfil .
We would be as good a dead if we have nothing leave to dream about .
What a delicious aroma that low-descending sun be extract from the aster and fern .
I wish we could see perfumes as well a smell them .
I 'm sure they would be very beautiful . ''
Gilbert be not to be thus sidetrack .
`` I have a dream , '' he say slowly .
`` I persist in dream it , although it have often seem to me that it could never come true .
I dream of a home with a hearth-fire in it , a cat and dog , the footstep of friend -- and YOU ! ''
Anne want to speak but she could find no word .
Happiness be break over her like a wave .
It almost frighten her .
`` I ask you a question over two year ago , Anne .
If I ask it again today will you give me a different answer ? ''
Still Anne could not speak .
But she lift her eye , shin with all the love-rapture of countless generation , and look into his for a moment .
He want no other answer .
They linger in the old garden until twilight , sweet a dusk in Eden must have be , creep over it .
There be so much to talk over and recall -- thing say and do and hear and think and felt and misunderstood .
`` I think you love Christine Stuart , '' Anne tell him , as reproachfully a if she have not give him every reason to suppose that she love Roy Gardner .
Gilbert laugh boyishly .
`` Christine be engage to somebody in her home town .
I know it and she know I know it .
When her brother graduate he tell me his sister be come to Kingsport the next winter to take music , and ask me if I would look after her a bit , a she know no one and would be very lonely .
So I do .
And then I like Christine for her own sake .
She be one of the nice girl I 've ever know .
I know college gossip credit u with be in love with each other .
I do n't care .
Nothing matter much to me for a time there , after you tell me you could never love me , Anne .
There be nobody else -- there never could be anybody else for me but you .
I 've love you ever since that day you break your slate over my head in school . ''
`` I do n't see how you could keep on love me when I be such a little fool , '' say Anne .
`` Well , I try to stop , '' say Gilbert frankly , `` not because I think you what you call yourself , but because I felt sure there be no chance for me after Gardner come on the scene .
But I could n't -- and I ca n't tell you , either , what it 's mean to me these two year to believe you be go to marry him , and be tell every week by some busybody that your engagement be on the point of be announce .
I believe it until one bless day when I be sit up after the fever .
I get a letter from Phil Gordon -- Phil Blake , rather -- in which she tell me there be really nothing between you and Roy , and advise me to ` try again . '
Well , the doctor be amaze at my rapid recovery after that . ''
Anne laugh -- then shiver .
`` I can never forget the night I think you be die , Gilbert .
Oh , I know -- I KNEW then -- and I think it be too late . ''
`` But it be n't , sweetheart .
Oh , Anne , this make up for everything , do n't it ?
Let 's resolve to keep this day sacred to perfect beauty all our life for the gift it have give u . ''
`` It 's the birthday of our happiness , '' say Anne softly .
`` I 've always love this old garden of Hester Gray 's , and now it will be dear than ever . ''
`` But I 'll have to ask you to wait a long time , Anne , '' say Gilbert sadly .
`` It will be three year before I 'll finish my medical course .
And even then there will be no diamond sunburst and marble hall . ''
Anne laugh .
`` I do n't want sunburst and marble hall .
I just want YOU .
You see I 'm quite as shameless a Phil about it .
Sunbursts and marble hall may be all very well , but there be more ` scope for imagination ' without them .
And a for the waiting , that do n't matter .
We 'll just be happy , wait and work for each other -- and dreaming .
Oh , dream will be very sweet now . ''
Gilbert draw her close to him and kiss her .

I .
The Hurrying of Ludovic Anne Shirley be curl up on the window-seat of Theodora Dix 's sitting-room one Saturday evening , look dreamily afar at some fair starland beyond the hill of sunset .
Anne be visit for a fortnight of her vacation at Echo Lodge , where Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Irving be spend the summer , and she often run over to the old Dix homestead to chat for awhile with Theodora .
They have have their chat out , on this particular evening , and Anne be give herself over to the delight of build an air-castle .
She lean her shapely head , with it braided coronet of dark red hair , against the window-casing , and her gray eye be like the moonlight gleam of shadowy pool .
Then she saw Ludovic Speed come down the lane .
He be yet far from the house , for the Dix lane be a long one , but Ludovic could be recognize as far a he could be see .
No one else in Middle Grafton have such a tall , gently-stooping , placidly-moving figure .
In every kink and turn of it there be an individuality all Ludovic 's own .
Anne rouse herself from her dream , think it would only be tactful to take her departure .
Ludovic be court Theodora .
Everyone in Grafton know that , or , if anyone be in ignorance of the fact , it be not because he have not have time to find out .
Ludovic have be come down that lane to see Theodora , in the same ruminating , unhastening fashion , for fifteen year !
When Anne , who be slim and girlish and romantic , rise to go , Theodora , who be plump and middle-aged and practical , say , with a twinkle in her eye : `` There be n't any hurry , child .
Sit down and have your call out .
You 've see Ludovic come down the lane , and , I suppose , you think you 'll be a crowd .
But you wo n't .
Ludovic rather like a third person around , and so do I .
It spur up the conversation a it be .
When a man have be come to see you straight along , twice a week for fifteen year , you get rather talk out by spell . ''
Theodora never pretend to bashfulness where Ludovic be concern .
She be not at all shy of refer to him and his dilatory courtship .
Indeed , it seem to amuse her .
Anne sit down again and together they watch Ludovic come down the lane , gaze calmly about him at the lush clover field and the blue loop of the river winding in and out of the misty valley below .
Anne look at Theodora 's placid , finely-moulded face and try to imagine what she herself would feel like if she be sit there , wait for an elderly lover who have , seemingly , take so long to make up his mind .
But even Anne 's imagination fail her for this .
`` Anyway , '' she think , impatiently , `` if I want him I think I 'd find some way of hurry him up .
Ludovic SPEED !
Was there ever such a misfit of a name ?
Such a name for such a man be a delusion and a snare . ''
Presently Ludovic get to the house , but stand so long on the doorstep in a brown study , gaze into the tangled green boskage of the cherry orchard , that Theodora finally go and open the door before he knock .
As she bring him into the sitting-room she make a comical grimace at Anne over his shoulder .
Ludovic smile pleasantly at Anne .
He like her ; she be the only young girl he know , for he generally avoid young girl -- they make him feel awkward and out of place .
But Anne do not affect him in this fashion .
She have a way of get on with all sort of people , and , although they have not know her very long , both Ludovic and Theodora look upon her a an old friend .
Ludovic be tall and somewhat ungainly , but his unhesitating placidity give him the appearance of a dignity that do not otherwise pertain to him .
He have a drooping , silky , brown moustache , and a little curly tuft of imperial , -- a fashion which be regard a eccentric in Grafton , where men have clean-shaven chin or go full-bearded .
His eye be dreamy and pleasant , with a touch of melancholy in their blue depth .
He sit down in the big bulgy old armchair that have belong to Theodora 's father .
Ludovic always sit there , and Anne declare that the chair have come to look like him .
The conversation soon grow animate enough .
Ludovic be a good talker when he have somebody to draw him out .
He be well read , and frequently surprise Anne by his shrewd comment on men and matter out in the world , of which only the faint echo reach Deland River .
He have also a liking for religious argument with Theodora , who do not care much for politics or the making of history , but be avid of doctrine , and read everything pertain thereto .
When the conversation drift into an eddy of friendly wrangle between Ludovic and Theodora over Christian Science , Anne understood that her usefulness be end for the time be , and that she would not be miss .
`` It 's star time and good-night time , '' she say , and go away quietly .
But she have to stop to laugh when she be well out of sight of the house , in a green meadow bestarred with the white and gold of daisy .
A wind , odour-freighted , blow daintily across it .
Anne lean against a white birch tree in the corner and laugh heartily , a she be apt to do whenever she think of Ludovic and Theodora .
To her eager youth , this courtship of theirs seem a very amusing thing .
She like Ludovic , but allow herself to be provoke with him .
`` The dear , big , irritate goose ! ''
she say aloud .
`` There never be such a lovable idiot before .
He 's just like the alligator in the old rhyme , who would n't go along , and would n't keep still , but just keep bob up and down . ''
Two evening later , when Anne go over to the Dix place , she and Theodora drift into a conversation about Ludovic .
Theodora , who be the most industrious soul alive , and have a mania for fancy work into the bargain , be busy her smooth , plump finger with a very elaborate Battenburg lace centre-piece .
Anne be lie back in a little rocker , with her slim hand fold in her lap , watch Theodora .
She realize that Theodora be very handsome , in a stately , Juno-like fashion of firm , white flesh , large , clearly-chiselled outline , and great , cowey , brown eye .
When Theodora be not smile , she look very impose .
Anne think it likely that Ludovic hold her in awe .
`` Did you and Ludovic talk about Christian Science ALL Saturday even ? ''
she ask .
Theodora overflow into a smile .
`` Yes , and we even quarrel over it .
At least I do .
Ludovic would n't quarrel with anyone .
You have to fight air when you spar with him .
I hate to square up to a person who wo n't hit back . ''
`` Theodora , '' say Anne coaxingly , `` I be go to be curious and impertinent .
You can snub me if you like .
Why do n't you and Ludovic get marry ? ''
Theodora laugh comfortably .
`` That 's the question Grafton folk have be ask for quite a while , I reckon , Anne .
Well , I 'd have no objection to marry Ludovic .
That 's frank enough for you , be n't it ?
But it 's not easy to marry a man unless he ask you .
And Ludovic have never ask me . ''
`` Is he too shy ? ''
persist Anne .
Since Theodora be in the mood , she mean to sift this puzzle affair to the bottom .
Theodora drop her work and look meditatively out over the green slope of the summer world .
`` No , I do n't think it be that .
Ludovic be n't shy .
It 's just his way -- the Speed way .
The Speeds be all dreadfully deliberate .
They spend year think over a thing before they make up their mind to do it .
Sometimes they get so much in the habit of think about it that they never get over it -- like old Alder Speed , who be always talk of go to England to see his brother , but never go , though there be no earthly reason why he should n't .
They 're not lazy , you know , but they love to take their time . ''
`` And Ludovic be just an aggravated case of Speedism , '' suggest Anne .
`` Exactly .
He never hurry in his life .
Why , he have be think for the last six year of get his house paint .
He talk it over with me every little while , and pick out the colour , and there the matter stay .
He 's fond of me , and he mean to ask me to have him sometime .
The only question be -- will the time ever come ? ''
`` Why do n't you hurry him up ? ''
ask Anne impatiently .
Theodora go back to her stitch with another laugh .
`` If Ludovic could be hurry up , I 'm not the one to do it .
I 'm too shy .
It sound ridiculous to hear a woman of my age and inch say that , but it be true .
Of course , I know it 's the only way any Speed ever do make out to get marry .
For instance , there 's a cousin of mine marry to Ludovic 's brother .
I do n't say she propose to him out and out , but , mind you , Anne , it be n't far from it .
I could n't do anything like that .
I DID try once .
When I realize that I be get sere and mellow , and all the girl of my generation be go off on either hand , I try to give Ludovic a hint .
But it stick in my throat .
And now I do n't mind .
If I do n't change Dix to Speed until I take the initiative , it will be Dix to the end of life .
Ludovic do n't realize that we be grow old , you know .
He think we be giddy young folk yet , with plenty of time before u .
That 's the Speed failing .
They never find out they 're alive until they 're dead . ''
`` You 're fond of Ludovic , be n't you ? ''
ask Anne , detect a note of real bitterness among Theodora 's paradox .
`` Laws , yes , '' say Theodora candidly .
She do not think it worth while to blush over so settle a fact .
`` I think the world and all of Ludovic .
And he certainly do need somebody to look after HIM .
He 's neglect -- he look fray .
You can see that for yourself .
That old aunt of his look after his house in some fashion , but she do n't look after him .
And he 's come now to the age when a man need to be look after and coddle a bit .
I 'm lonesome here , and Ludovic be lonesome up there , and it do seem ridiculous , do n't it ?
I do n't wonder that we 're the stand joke of Grafton .
Goodness know , I laugh at it enough myself .
I 've sometimes think that if Ludovic could be make jealous it might spur him along .
But I never could flirt and there 's nobody to flirt with if I could .
Everybody hereabouts look upon me a Ludovic 's property and nobody would dream of interfere with him . ''
`` Theodora , '' cry Anne , `` I have a plan ! ''
`` Now , what be you go to do ? ''
exclaim Theodora .
Anne tell her .
At first Theodora laugh and protest .
In the end , she yield somewhat doubtfully , overborne by Anne 's enthusiasm .
`` Well , try it , then , '' she say , resignedly .
`` If Ludovic get mad and leave me , I 'll be bad off than ever .
But nothing venture , nothing win .
And there be a fight chance , I suppose .
Besides , I must admit I 'm tired of his dilly-dallying . ''
Anne go back to Echo Lodge tingle with delight in her plot .
She hunt up Arnold Sherman , and tell him what be require of him .
Arnold Sherman listen and laugh .
He be an elderly widower , an intimate friend of Stephen Irving , and have come down to spend part of the summer with him and his wife in Prince Edward Island .
He be handsome in a mature style , and he have a dash of mischief in him still , so that he enter readily enough into Anne 's plan .
It amuse him to think of hurry Ludovic Speed , and he know that Theodora Dix could be depend on to do her part .
The comedy would not be dull , whatever it outcome .
The curtain rise on the first act after prayer meeting on the next Thursday night .
It be bright moonlight when the people come out of church , and everybody saw it plainly .
Arnold Sherman stand upon the step close to the door , and Ludovic Speed lean up against a corner of the graveyard fence , a he have do for year .
The boy say he have wear the paint off that particular place .
Ludovic knew of no reason why he should paste himself up against the church door .
Theodora would come out a usual , and he would join her a she go past the corner .
This be what happen , Theodora come down the step , her stately figure outline in it darkness against the gush of lamplight from the porch .
Arnold Sherman ask her if he might see her home .
Theodora take his arm calmly , and together they sweep past the stupefied Ludovic , who stand helplessly gaze after them a if unable to believe his eye .
For a few moment he stand there limply ; then he start down the road after his fickle lady and her new admirer .
The boy and irresponsible young men crowd after , expect some excitement , but they be disappoint .
Ludovic strode on until he overtake Theodora and Arnold Sherman , and then fell meekly in behind them .
Theodora hardly enjoy her walk home , although Arnold Sherman lay himself out to be especially entertaining .
Her heart yearn after Ludovic , whose shuffle footstep she hear behind her .
She fear that she have be very cruel , but she be in for it now .
She steel herself by the reflection that it be all for his own good , and she talk to Arnold Sherman a if he be the one man in the world .
Poor , desert Ludovic , follow humbly behind , hear her , and if Theodora have know how bitter the cup she be hold to his lip really be , she would never have be resolute enough to present it , no matter for what ultimate good .
When she and Arnold turn in at her gate , Ludovic have to stop .
Theodora look over her shoulder and saw him stand still on the road .
His forlorn figure haunt her thought all night .
If Anne have not run over the next day and bolster up her conviction , she might have spoil everything by prematurely relent .
Ludovic , meanwhile , stand still on the road , quite oblivious to the hoot and comment of the vastly amuse small boy contingent , until Theodora and his rival disappear from his view under the fir in the hollow of her lane .
Then he turn about and go home , not with his usual leisurely amble , but with a perturbed stride which proclaim his inward disquiet .
He felt bewilder .
If the world have come suddenly to an end or if the lazy , meander Grafton River have turn about and flow up hill , Ludovic could not have be more astonished .
For fifteen year he have walk home from meeting with Theodora ; and now this elderly stranger , with all the glamour of `` the States '' hang about him , have coolly walk off with her under Ludovic 's very nose .
Worse -- most unkind cut of all -- Theodora have go with him willingly ; nay , she have evidently enjoy his company .
Ludovic felt the stirring of a righteous anger in his easy-going soul .
When he reach the end of his lane , he pause at his gate , and look at his house , set back from the lane in a crescent of birch .
Even in the moonlight , it weather-worn aspect be plainly visible .
He think of the `` palatial residence '' rumour ascribe to Arnold Sherman in Boston , and stroke his chin nervously with his sunburnt finger .
Then he double up his fist and strike it smartly on the gate-post .
`` Theodora need n't think she be go to jilt me in this fashion , after keep company with me for fifteen year , '' he say .
`` I 'LL have something to say to it , Arnold Sherman or no Arnold Sherman .
The impudence of the puppy ! ''
The next morning Ludovic drove to Carmody and engage Joshua Pye to come and paint his house , and that even , although he be not due till Saturday night , he go down to see Theodora .
Arnold Sherman be there before him , and be actually sit in Ludovic 's own prescriptive chair .
Ludovic have to deposit himself in Theodora 's new wicker rocker , where he look and felt lamentably out of place .
If Theodora felt the situation to be awkward , she carry it off superbly .
She have never look handsomer , and Ludovic perceive that she wear her second best silk dress .
He wonder miserably if she have don it in expectation of his rival 's call .
She have never put on silk dress for him .
Ludovic have always be the meek and mild of mortal , but he felt quite murderous a he sit mutely there and listen to Arnold Sherman 's polished conversation .
`` You should just have be here to see him glower , '' Theodora tell the delighted Anne the next day .
`` It may be wicked of me , but I felt real glad .
I be afraid he might stay away and sulk .
So long a he come here and sulk I do n't worry .
But he be feel badly enough , poor soul , and I 'm really eat up by remorse .
He try to outstay Mr. Sherman last night , but he do n't manage it .
You never saw a more depressed-looking creature than he be a he hurry down the lane .
Yes , he actually hurry . ''
The following Sunday even Arnold Sherman walk to church with Theodora , and sit with her .
When they come in Ludovic Speed suddenly stand up in his pew under the gallery .
He sit down again at once , but everybody in view have see him , and that night folk in all the length and breadth of Grafton River discuss the dramatic occurrence with keen enjoyment .
`` Yes , he jump right up as if he be pull on his foot , while the minister be read the chapter , '' say his cousin , Lorella Speed , who have be in church , to her sister , who have not .
`` His face be as white a a sheet , and his eye be just glare out of his head .
I never felt so thrilled , I declare !
I almost expect him to fly at them then and there .
But he just give a sort of gasp and set down again .
I do n't know whether Theodora Dix saw him or not .
She look a cool and unconcerned a you please . ''
Theodora have not see Ludovic , but if she look cool and unconcerned , her appearance belie her , for she felt miserably fluster .
She could not prevent Arnold Sherman come to church with her , but it seem to her like go too far .
People do not go to church and sit together in Grafton unless they be the next thing to be engage .
What if this fill Ludovic with the narcotic of despair instead of waken him up !
She sit through the service in misery and heard not one word of the sermon .
But Ludovic 's spectacular performance be not yet over .
The Speeds might be hard to get start , but once they be start their momentum be irresistible .
When Theodora and Mr. Sherman come out , Ludovic be wait on the step .
He stand up straight and stern , with his head throw back and his shoulder square .
There be open defiance in the look he cast on his rival , and masterfulness in the mere touch of the hand he lay on Theodora 's arm .
`` May I see you home , Miss Dix ? ''
his word say .
His tone say , `` I be go to see you home whether or no . ''
Theodora , with a deprecate look at Arnold Sherman , take his arm , and Ludovic march her across the green amid a silence which the very horse tie to the storm fence seem to share .
For Ludovic 't be a crowded hour of glorious life .
Anne walk all the way over from Avonlea the next day to hear the news .
Theodora smile consciously .
`` Yes , it be really settle at last , Anne .
Coming home last night Ludovic ask me plump and plain to marry him , -- Sunday and all a it be .
It 's to be right away -- for Ludovic wo n't be put off a week long than necessary . ''
`` So Ludovic Speed have be hurry up to some purpose at last , '' say Mr. Sherman , when Anne call in at Echo Lodge , brimful with her news .
`` And you be delighted , of course , and my poor pride must be the scapegoat .
I shall always be remember in Grafton a the man from Boston who want Theodora Dix and could n't get her . ''
`` But that wo n't be true , you know , '' say Anne comfortingly .
Arnold Sherman thought of Theodora 's ripe beauty , and the mellow companionableness she have reveal in their brief intercourse .
`` I 'm not perfectly sure of that , '' he say , with a half sigh .
II .
Old Lady Lloyd I .
The May Chapter Spencervale gossip always say that `` Old Lady Lloyd '' be rich and mean and proud .
Gossip , a usual , be one-third right and two-thirds wrong .
Old Lady Lloyd be neither rich nor mean ; in reality she be pitifully poor -- so poor that `` Crooked Jack '' Spencer , who dig her garden and chop her wood for her , be opulent by contrast , for he , at least , never lack three meal a day , and the Old Lady could sometimes achieve no more than one .
But she WAS very proud -- so proud that she would have die rather than let the Spencervale people , among whom she have queen it in her youth , suspect how poor she be and to what strait be sometimes reduce .
She much prefer to have them think her miserly and odd -- a queer old recluse who never go anywhere , even to church , and who pay the small subscription to the minister 's salary of anyone in the congregation .
`` And her just rolling in wealth ! ''
they say indignantly .
`` Well , she do n't get her miserly way from her parent .
THEY be real generous and neighbourly .
There never be a finer gentleman than old Doctor Lloyd .
He be always do kindness to everybody ; and he have a way of do them that make you feel a if you be do the favour , not him .
Well , well , let Old Lady Lloyd keep herself and her money to herself if she want to .
If she do n't want our company , she do n't have to suffer it , that 's all .
Reckon she be n't none too happy for all her money and pride . ''
No , the Old Lady be none too happy , that be unfortunately true .
It be not easy to be happy when your life be eat up with loneliness and emptiness on the spiritual side , and when , on the material side , all you have between you and starvation be the little money your hen bring you in .
The Old Lady live `` away back at the old Lloyd place , '' a it be always call .
It be a quaint , low-eaved house , with big chimney and square window and with spruce grow thickly all around it .
The Old Lady live there all alone and there be week at a time when she never saw a human be except Crooked Jack .
What the Old Lady do with herself and how she put in her time be a puzzle the Spencervale people could not solve .
The child believe she amuse herself count the gold in the big black box under her bed .
Spencervale child hold the Old Lady in mortal terror ; some of them -- the `` Spencer Road '' fry -- believe she be a witch ; all of them would run if , when wander about the wood in search of berry or spruce gum , they saw at a distance the spare , upright form of the Old Lady , gather stick for her fire .
Mary Moore be the only one who be quite sure she be not a witch .
`` Witches be always ugly , '' she say decisively , `` and Old Lady Lloyd be n't ugly .
She 's real pretty -- she 's get such a soft white hair and big black eye and a little white face .
Those Road child do n't know what they 're talk of .
Mother say they 're a very ignorant crowd . ''
`` Well , she do n't ever go to church , and she mutter and talk to herself all the time she 's pick up stick , '' maintain Jimmy Kimball stoutly .
The Old Lady talk to herself because she be really very fond of company and conversation .
To be sure , when you have talk to nobody but yourself for nearly twenty year , it be apt to grow somewhat monotonous ; and there be time when the Old Lady would have sacrifice everything but her pride for a little human companionship .
At such time she felt very bitter and resentful toward Fate for have take everything from her .
She have nothing to love , and that be about a unwholesome a condition a be possible to anyone .
It be always hard in the spring .
Once upon a time the Old Lady -- when she have not be the Old Lady , but pretty , wilful , high-spirited Margaret Lloyd -- have love spring ; now she hat them because they hurt her ; and this particular spring of this particular May chapter hurt her more than any that have go before .
The Old Lady felt a if she could NOT endure the ache of it .
Everything hurt her -- the new green tip on the fir , the fairy mist down in the little beech hollow below the house , the fresh smell of the red earth Crooked Jack spade up in her garden .
The Old Lady lay awake all one moonlit night and cry for very heartache .
She even forget her body hunger in her soul hunger ; and the Old Lady have be hungry , more or less , all that week .
She be live on store biscuit and water , so that she might be able to pay Crooked Jack for dig her garden .
When the pale , lovely dawn-colour come steal up the sky behind the spruce , the Old Lady bury her face in her pillow and refuse to look at it .
`` I hate the new day , '' she say rebelliously .
`` It will be just like all the other hard , common day .
I do n't want to get up and live it .
And , oh , to think that long ago I reach out my hand joyfully to every new day , a to a friend who be bring me good tidings !
I love the morning then -- sunny or gray , they be as delightful a an unread book -- and now I hate them -- hate them -- hate them ! ''
But the Old Lady get up nevertheless , for she know Crooked Jack would be come early to finish the garden .
She arrange her beautiful , thick , white hair very carefully , and put on her purple silk dress with the little gold spot in it .
The Old Lady always wear silk from motif of economy .
It be much cheap to wear a silk dress that have belong to her mother than to buy new print at the store .
The Old Lady have plenty of silk dress which have belong to her mother .
She wear them morning , noon , and night , and Spencervale people consider it an additional evidence of her pride .
As for the fashion of them , it be , of course , just because she be too mean to have them make over .
They do not dream that the Old Lady never put on one of the silk dress without agonize over it unfashionableness , and that even the eye of Crooked Jack cast on her antique flounce and overskirt be almost more than her feminine vanity could endure .
In spite of the fact that the Old Lady have not welcome the new day , it beauty charm her when she go out for a walk after her dinner -- or , rather , after her mid-day biscuit .
It be so fresh , so sweet , so virgin ; and the spruce wood around the old Lloyd place be athrill with busy spring doings and all sprinkle through with young light and shadow .
Some of their delight find it way into the Old Lady 's bitter heart a she wander through them , and when she come out at the little plank bridge over the brook down under the beech , she felt almost gentle and tender once more .
There be one big beech there , in particular , which the Old Lady love for reason best know to herself -- a great , tall beech with a trunk like the shaft of a gray marble column and a leafy spread of branch over the still , golden-brown pool make beneath it by the brook .
It have be a young sapling in the day that be haloed by the vanished glory of the Old Lady 's life .
The Old Lady hear childish voice and laughter afar up the lane which lead to William Spencer 's place just above the wood .
William Spencer 's front lane run out to the main road in a different direction , but this `` back lane '' furnish a short cut and his child always go to school that way .
The Old Lady shrink hastily back behind a clump of young spruce .
She do not like the Spencer child because they always seem so afraid of her .
Through the spruce screen she could see them come gaily down the lane -- the two old one in front , the twin behind , cling to the hand of a tall , slim , young girl -- the new music teacher , probably .
The Old Lady have hear from the egg pedlar that she be go to board at William Spencer 's , but she have not hear her name .
She look at her with some curiosity a they draw near -- and then , all at once , the Old Lady 's heart give a great bound and begin to beat a it have not beat for year , while her breath come quickly and she tremble violently .
Who -- WHO could this girl be ?
Under the new music teacher 's straw hat be mass of fine chestnut hair of the very shade and wave that the Old Lady remember on another head in vanished year ; from under those wave look large , violet-blue eye with very black lash and brow -- and the Old Lady know those eye as well a she know her own ; and the new music teacher 's face , with all it beauty of delicate outline and dainty colouring and glad , buoyant youth , be a face from the Old Lady 's past -- a perfect resemblance in every respect save one ; the face which the Old Lady remember have be weak , with all it charm ; but this girl 's face possess a fine , dominant strength compact of sweetness and womanliness .
As she pass by the Old Lady 's hiding place she laugh at something one of the child say ; and oh , but the Old Lady know that laughter well .
She have hear it before under that very beech tree .
She watch them until they disappear over the wooded hill beyond the bridge ; and then she go back home a if she walk in a dream .
Crooked Jack be delve vigorously in the garden ; ordinarily the Old Lady do not talk much with Crooked Jack , for she dislike his weakness for gossip ; but now she go into the garden , a stately old figure in her purple , gold-spotted silk , with the sunshine gleam on her white hair .
Crooked Jack have see her go out and have remark to himself that the Old Lady be lose ground ; she be pale and peaked-looking .
He now conclude that he have be mistake .
The Old Lady 's cheek be pink and her eye shin .
Somewhere in her walk she have shed ten year at least .
Crooked Jack lean on his spade and decide that there be n't many finer look woman anywhere than Old Lady Lloyd .
Pity she be such an old miser !
`` Mr. Spencer , '' say the Old Lady graciously -- she always speak very graciously to her inferior when she talk to them at all -- `` can you tell me the name of the new music teacher who be board at Mr. William Spencer 's ? ''
`` Sylvia Gray , '' say Crooked Jack .
The Old Lady 's heart give another great bound .
But she have know it -- she have know that girl with Leslie Gray 's hair and eye and laugh must be Leslie Gray 's daughter .
Crooked Jack spat on his hand and resume his work , but his tongue go fast than his spade , and the Old Lady listen greedily .
For the first time she enjoy and bless Crooked Jack 's garrulity and gossip .
Every word he utter be a an apple of gold in a picture of silver to her .
He have be work at William Spencer 's the day the new music teacher have come , and what Crooked Jack could n't find out about any person in one whole day -- at least as far a outward life go -- be hardly worth find out .
Next to discover thing do he love tell them , and it would be hard to say which enjoy that ensue half-hour more -- Crooked Jack or the Old Lady .
Crooked Jack 's account , boil down , amount to this ; both Miss Gray 's parent have die when she be a baby , she have be bring up by an aunt , she be very poor and very ambitious .
`` Wants a moosical eddication , '' finish up Crooked Jack , `` and , by jingo , she orter have it , for anything like the voice of her I never heerd .
She sing for u that even after supper and I think 't be an angel singing .
It just go through me like a shaft o ' light .
The Spencer young one be crazy over her already .
She 's get twenty pupil around here and in Grafton and Avonlea . ''
When the Old Lady have find out everything Crooked Jack could tell her , she go into the house and sit down by the window of her little sitting-room to think it all over .
She be tingle from head to foot with excitement .
Leslie 's daughter !
This Old Lady have have her romance once .
Long ago -- forty year ago -- she have be engage to Leslie Gray , a young college student who teach in Spencervale for the summer term one year -- the golden summer of Margaret Lloyd 's life .
Leslie have be a shy , dreamy , handsome fellow with literary ambition , which , a he and Margaret both firmly believe , would one day bring him fame and fortune .
Then there have be a foolish , bitter quarrel at the end of that golden summer .
Leslie have go away in anger , afterwards he have write , but Margaret Lloyd , still in the grasp of her pride and resentment , have send a harsh answer .
No more letter come ; Leslie Gray never return ; and one day Margaret waken to the realization that she have put love out of her life for ever .
She know it would never be hers again ; and from that moment her foot be turn from youth to walk down the valley of shadow to a lonely , eccentric age .
Many year later she hear of Leslie 's marriage ; then come news of his death , after a life that have not fulfil his dream for him .
Nothing more she have hear or know -- nothing to this day , when she have see his daughter pas her by unseeing in the beech hollow .
`` His daughter !
And she might have be MY daughter , '' murmur the Old Lady .
`` Oh , if I could only know her and love her -- and perhaps win her love in return !
But I can not .
I could not have Leslie Gray 's daughter know how poor I be -- how low I have be bring .
I could not bear that .
And to think she be live so near me , the darling -- just up the lane and over the hill .
I can see her go by every day -- I can have that dear pleasure , at least .
But oh , if I could only do something for her -- give her some little pleasure !
It would be such a delight . ''
When the Old Lady happen to go into her spare room that evening , she saw from it a light shin through a gap in the tree on the hill .
She know that it shine from the Spencers ' spare room .
So it be Sylvia 's light .
The Old Lady stand in the darkness and watch it until it go out -- watch it with a great sweetness breathing in her heart , such a risen from old rose-leaves when they be stir .
She fancy Sylvia move about her room , brushing and braid her long , glisten hair -- lay aside her little trinket and girlish adornment -- make her simple preparation for sleep .
When the light go out the Old Lady picture a slight white figure kneeling by the window in the soft starshine , and the Old Lady kneel down then and there and say her own prayer in fellowship .
She say the simple form of word she have always use ; but a new spirit seem to inspire them ; and she finish with a new petition -- `` Let me think of something I can do for her , dear Father -- some little , little thing that I can do for her . ''
The Old Lady have sleep in the same room all her life -- the one look north into the spruce -- and love it ; but the next day she move into the spare room without a regret .
It be to be her room after this ; she must be where she could see Sylvia 's light , she put the bed where she could lie in it and look at that earth star which have suddenly shine across the twilight shadow of her heart .
She felt very happy , she have not felt happy for many year ; but now a strange , new , dream-like interest , remote from the harsh reality of her existence , but none the less comforting and alluring , have enter into her life .
Besides , she have think of something she could do for Sylvia -- `` a little , little thing '' that might give her pleasure .
Spencervale people be wont to say regretfully that there be no Mayflowers in Spencervale ; the Spencervale young fry , when they want Mayflowers , think they have to go over to the barren at Avonlea , six mile away , for them .
Old Lady Lloyd know well .
In her many long , solitary ramble , she have discover a little clearing far back in the wood -- a southward-sloping , sandy hill on a tract of woodland belonging to a man who live in town -- which in spring be star over with the pink and white of arbutus .
To this clear the Old Lady betook herself that afternoon , walk through wood lane and under dim spruce arch like a woman with a glad purpose .
All at once the spring be dear and beautiful to her once more ; for love have enter again into her heart , and her starved soul be feast on it divine nourishment .
Old Lady Lloyd find a wealth of Mayflowers on the sandy hill .
She fill her basket with them , gloat over the loveliness which be to give pleasure to Sylvia .
When she get home she write on a slip of paper , `` For Sylvia . ''
It be not likely anyone in Spencervale would know her handwriting , but , to make sure , she disguise it , write in round , big letter like a child 's .
She carry her Mayflowers down to the hollow and heap them in a recess between the big root of the old beech , with the little note thrust through a stem on top .
Then the Old Lady deliberately hide behind the spruce clump .
She have put on her dark green silk on purpose for hiding .
She have not long to wait .
Soon Sylvia Gray come down the hill with Mattie Spencer .
When she reach the bridge she saw the Mayflowers and give an exclamation of delight .
Then she saw her name and her expression change to wonder .
The Old Lady , peer through the bough , could have laugh for very pleasure over the success of her little plot .
`` For me ! ''
say Sylvia , lift the flower .
`` CAN they really be for me , Mattie ?
Who could have leave them here ? ''
Mattie giggle .
`` I believe it be Chris Stewart , '' she say .
`` I know he be over at Avonlea last night .
And ma say he 's take a notion to you -- she know by the way he look at you when you be sing night before last .
It would be just like him to do something queer like this -- he 's such a shy fellow with the girl . ''
Sylvia frown a little .
She do not like Mattie 's expression , but she do like Mayflowers , and she do not dislike Chris Stewart , who have seem to her merely a nice , modest , country boy .
She lift the flower and bury her face in them .
`` Anyway , I 'm much oblige to the giver , whoever he or she be , '' she say merrily .
`` There 's nothing I love like Mayflowers .
Oh , how sweet they be ! ''
When they have pass the Old Lady emerge from her lurking place , flush with triumph .
It do not vex her that Sylvia should think Chris Stewart have give her the flower ; nay , it be all the good , since she would be the less likely to suspect the real donor .
The main thing be that Sylvia should have the delight of them .
That quite satisfy the Old Lady , who go back to her lonely house with the cockle of her heart all in a glow .
It soon be a matter of gossip in Spencervale that Chris Stewart be leave Mayflowers at the beech hollow for the music teacher every other day .
Chris himself deny it , but he be not believe .
Firstly , there be no Mayflowers in Spencervale ; secondly , Chris have to go to Carmody every other day to haul milk to the butter factory , and Mayflowers grow in Carmody , and , thirdly , the Stewarts always have a romantic streak in them .
Was not that enough circumstantial evidence for anybody ?
As for Sylvia , she do not mind if Chris have a boyish admiration for her and express it thus delicately .
She think it very nice of him , indeed , when he do not vex her with any other advance , and she be quite content to enjoy his Mayflowers .
Old Lady Lloyd hear all the gossip about it from the egg pedlar , and listen to him with laughter glimmer far down in her eye .
The egg pedlar go away and vow he 'd never see the Old Lady so spry a she be this spring ; she seem real interested in the young folk 's doings .
The Old Lady keep her secret and grow young in it .
She walk back to the Mayflower hill as long a the Mayflowers last ; and she always hide in the spruce to see Sylvia Gray go by .
Every day she love her more , and yearn after her more deeply .
All the long repressed tenderness of her nature overflow to this girl who be unconscious of it .
She be proud of Sylvia 's grace and beauty , and sweetness of voice and laughter .
She begin to like the Spencer child because they worship Sylvia ; she envy Mrs. Spencer because the latter could minister to Sylvia 's need .
Even the egg pedlar seem a delightful person because he bring news of Sylvia -- her social popularity , her professional success , the love and admiration she have win already .
The Old Lady never dream of reveal herself to Sylvia .
That , in her poverty , be not to be think of for a moment .
It would have be very sweet to know her -- sweet to have her come to the old house -- sweet to talk to her -- to enter into her life .
But it might not be .
The Old Lady 's pride be still far strong than her love .
It be the one thing she have never sacrifice and never -- so she believe -- could sacrifice .
II .
The June Chapter There be no Mayflowers in June ; but now the Old Lady 's garden be full of blossom and every morning Sylvia find a bouquet of them by the beech -- the perfumed ivory of white narcissus , the flame of tulip , the fairy branch of bleeding-heart , the pink-and-snow of little , thorny , single , sweetbreathed early rose .
The Old Lady have no fear of discovery , for the flower that grow in her garden grow in every other Spencervale garden as well , include the Stewart garden .
Chris Stewart , when he be tease about the music teacher , merely smile and hold his peace .
Chris know perfectly well who be the real giver of those flower .
He have make it his business to find out when the Mayflower gossip start .
But since it be evident Old Lady Lloyd do not wish it to be know , Chris tell no one .
Chris have always like Old Lady Lloyd ever since the day , ten year before , when she have find him cry in the wood with a cut foot and have take him into her house , and bath and bind the wound , and give him ten cent to buy candy at the store .
The Old Lady go without supper that night because of it , but Chris never know that .
The Old Lady think it a most beautiful June .
She no longer hat the new day ; on the contrary , she welcome them .
`` Every day be an uncommon day now , '' she say jubilantly to herself -- for do not almost every day bring her a glimpse of Sylvia ?
Even on rainy day the Old Lady gallantly brave rheumatism to hide behind her clump of drip spruce and watch Sylvia pas .
The only day she could not see her be Sundays ; and no Sundays have ever seem so long to Old Lady Lloyd a those June Sundays do .
One day the egg pedlar have news for her .
`` The music teacher be go to sing a solo for a collection piece to-morrow , '' he tell her .
The Old Lady 's black eye flash with interest .
`` I do n't know Miss Gray be a member of the choir , '' she say .
`` Jined two Sundays ago .
I tell you , our music be something worth listen to now .
The church 'll be pack to-morrow , I reckon -- her name 's go all over the country for sing .
You ought to come and hear it , Miss Lloyd . ''
The pedlar say this out of bravado , merely to show he be n't scar of the Old Lady , for all her grand air .
The Old Lady make no answer , and he think he have offend her .
He go away , wish he have n't say it .
Had he but know it , the Old Lady have forget the existence of all and any egg pedlar .
He have blot himself and his insignificance out of her consciousness by his last sentence .
All her thought , feeling , and wish be submerge in a very whirlpool of desire to hear Sylvia sing that solo .
She go into the house in a tumult and try to conquer that desire .
She could not do it , even think she summon all her pride to her aid .
Pride say : `` You will have to go to church to hear her .
You have n't fit clothes to go to church in .
Think what a figure you will make before them all . ''
But , for the first time , a more insistent voice than pride speak to her soul -- and , for the first time , the Old Lady listen to it .
It be too true that she have never go to church since the day on which she have to begin wear her mother 's silk dress .
The Old Lady herself think that this be very wicked ; and she try to atone by keep Sunday very strictly , and always have a little service of her own , morning and evening .
She sing three hymn in her cracked voice , pray aloud , and read a sermon .
But she could not bring herself to go to church in her out-of-date clothes -- she , who have once set the fashion in Spencervale , and the long she stay away , the more impossible it seem that she should ever again go .
Now the impossible have become , not only possible , but insistent .
She must go to church and hear Sylvia sing , no matter how ridiculous she appear , no matter how people talk and laugh at her .
Spencervale congregation have a mild sensation the next afternoon .
Just before the opening of service Old Lady Lloyd walk up the aisle and sit down in the long-unoccupied Lloyd pew , in front of the pulpit .
The Old Lady 's very soul be writhe within her .
She recall the reflection she have see in her mirror before she leave -- the old black silk in the mode of thirty year agone and the queer little bonnet of shirred black satin .
She think how absurd she must look in the eye of her world .
As a matter of fact , she do not look in the least absurd .
Some woman might have ; but the Old Lady 's stately distinction of carriage and figure be so subtly command that it do away with the consideration of garment altogether .
The Old Lady do not know this .
But she do know that Mrs. Kimball , the storekeeper 's wife , presently rustle into the next pew in the very late fashion of fabric and mode ; she and Mrs. Kimball be the same age , and there have be a time when the latter have be content to imitate Margaret Lloyd 's costume at a humble distance .
But the storekeeper have propose , and thing be change now ; and there sat poor Old Lady Lloyd , feel the change bitterly , and half wish she have not come to church at all .
Then all at once the Angel of Love touch there foolish thought , born of vanity and morbid pride , and they melt away a if they have never be .
Sylvia Gray have come into the choir , and be sit just where the afternoon sunshine fell over her beautiful hair like a halo .
The Old Lady look at her in a rapture of satisfied longing and thenceforth the service be bless to her , a anything be bless which come through the medium of unselfish love , whether human or divine .
Nay , be they not one and the same , differ in degree only , not in kind ?
The Old Lady have never have such a good , satisfying look at Sylvia before .
All her former glimpse have be steal and fleet .
Now she sit and gazed upon her to her hungry heart 's content , linger delightedly over every little charm and loveliness -- the way Sylvia 's shin hair ripple back from her forehead , the sweet little trick she have of drop quickly her long-lashed eyelid when she encounter too bold or curious a glance , and the slender , beautifully model hand -- so like Leslie Gray 's hand -- that hold her hymn book .
She be dress very plainly in a black skirt and a white shirtwaist ; but none of the other girl in the choir , with all their fine feather , could hold a candle to her -- a the egg pedlar say to his wife , go home from church .
The Old Lady listen to the opening hymn with keen pleasure .
Sylvia 's voice thrill through and dominate them all .
But when the usher get up to take the collection , an undercurrent of subdued excitement flow over the congregation .
Sylvia rise and come forward to Janet Moore 's side at the organ .
The next moment her beautiful voice soar through the building like the very soul of melody -- true , clear , powerful , sweet .
Nobody in Spencervale have ever listen to such a voice , except Old Lady Lloyd herself , who , in her youth , have hear enough good singing to enable her to be a tolerable judge of it .
She realize instantly that this girl of her heart have a great gift -- a gift that would some day bring her fame and fortune , if it could be duly trained and develop .
`` Oh , I 'm so glad I come to church , '' think Old Lady Lloyd .
When the solo be end , the Old Lady 's conscience compel her to drag her eye and thought from Sylvia , and fasten them on the minister , who have be flatter himself all through the opening portion of the service that Old Lady Lloyd have come to church on his account .
He be newly settle , have be in charge of the Spencervale congregation only a few month ; he be a clever little fellow and he honestly think it be the fame of his preaching that have bring Old Lady Lloyd out to church .
When the service be over all the Old Lady 's neighbour come to speak to her , with kindly smile and handshake .
They think they ought to encourage her , now that she have make a start in the right direction ; the Old Lady like their cordiality , and like it none the le because she detect in it the same unconscious respect and deference she have be wont to receive in the old day -- a respect and deference which her personality compel from all who approach her .
The Old Lady be surprise to find that she could command it still , in defiance of unfashionable bonnet and ancient attire .
Janet Moore and Sylvia Gray walk home from church together .
`` Did you see Old Lady Lloyd out to-day ? ''
ask Janet .
`` I be amaze when she walk in .
She have never be to church in my recollection .
What a quaint old figure she be !
She 's very rich , you know , but she wear her mother 's old clothes and never get a new thing .
Some people think she be mean ; but , '' conclude Janet charitably , `` I believe it be simply eccentricity . ''
`` I felt that be Miss Lloyd as soon a I saw her , although I have never see her before , '' say Sylvia dreamily .
`` I have be wish to see her -- for a certain reason .
She have a very striking face .
I should like to meet her -- to know her . ''
`` I do n't think it 's likely you ever will , '' say Janet carelessly .
`` She do n't like young people and she never go anywhere .
I do n't think I 'd like to know her .
I 'd be afraid of her -- she have such stately way and such strange , pierce eye . '' ''
I should n't be afraid of her , '' say Sylvia to herself , a she turn into the Spencer lane .
`` But I do n't expect I 'll ever become acquainted with her .
If she know who I be I suppose she would dislike me .
I suppose she never suspect that I be Leslie Gray 's daughter . ''
The minister , think it well to strike while the iron be hot , go up to call on Old Lady Lloyd the very next afternoon .
He go in fear and trembling , for he have hear thing about Old Lady Lloyd ; but she make herself so agreeable in her high-bred fashion that he be delight , and tell his wife when he go home that Spencervale people do n't understand Miss Lloyd .
This be perfectly true ; but it be by no mean certain that the minister understand her either .
He make only one mistake in tact , but , a the Old Lady do not snub him for it , he never know he make it .
When he be leave he say , `` I hope we shall see you at church next Sunday , Miss Lloyd . ''
`` Indeed , you will , '' say the Old Lady emphatically .
III .
The July Chapter The first day of July Sylvia find a little birch bark boat full of strawberry at the beech in the hollow .
They be the early of the season ; the Old Lady have find them in one of her secret haunt .
They would have be a toothsome addition to the Old Lady 's own slender bill of fare ; but she never think of eat them .
She get far more pleasure out of the thought of Sylvia 's enjoy them for her tea .
Thereafter the strawberry alternate with the flower as long a they last , and then come blueberry and raspberry .
The blueberry grow far away and the Old Lady have many a tramp after them .
Sometimes her bone ache at night because of it ; but what care the Old Lady for that ?
Bone ache be easy to endure than soul ache ; and the Old Lady 's soul have stop ache for the first time in many year .
It be be nourish with heavenly manna .
One evening Crooked Jack come up to fix something that have go wrong with the Old Lady 's well .
The Old Lady wander affably out to him ; for she know he have be work at the Spencers ' all day , and there might be crumb of information about Sylvia to be pick up .
`` I reckon the music teacher 's feeling pretty blue this evening , '' Crooked Jack remark , after strain the Old Lady 's patience to the last verge of human endurance by expatiate on William Spencer 's new pump , and Mrs. Spencer 's new washing-machine , and Amelia Spencer 's new young man .
`` Why ? ''
ask the Old Lady , turn very pale .
Had anything happen to Sylvia ?
`` Well , she 's be invite to a big party at Mrs. Moore 's brother 's in town , and she have n't get a dress to go in , '' say Crooked Jack .
`` They 're great swell and everybody will be get up regardless .
Mrs. Spencer be tell me about it .
She say Miss Gray ca n't afford a new dress because she 's help to pay her aunt 's doctor 's bill .
She say she 's sure Miss Gray feel awful disappoint over it , though she do n't let on .
But Mrs. Spencer say she know she be cry after she go to bed last night . ''
The Old Lady turn and go into the house abruptly .
This be dreadful .
Sylvia must go to that party -- she MUST .
But how be it to be manage ?
Through the Old Lady 's brain pass wild thought of her mother 's silk dress .
But none of them would be suitable , even if there be time to make one over .
Never have the Old Lady so bitterly regret her vanish wealth .
`` I 've only two dollar in the house , '' she say , `` and I 've get to live on that till the next day the egg pedlar come round .
Is there anything I can sell -- ANYTHING ?
Yes , yes , the grape jug ! ''
Up to this time , the Old Lady would as soon have think of try to sell her head a the grape jug .
The grape jug be two hundred year old and have be in the Lloyd family ever since it be a jug at all .
It be a big , pot-bellied affair , festoon with pink-gilt grape , and with a verse of poetry print on one side , and it have be give a a wedding present to the Old Lady 's great-grandmother .
As long a the Old Lady could remember it have sit on the top shelf in the cupboard in the sitting-room wall , far too precious ever to be use .
Two year before , a woman who collect old china have explore Spencervale , and , get word of the grape jug , have boldly invade the old Lloyd place and offer to buy it .
She never , to her die day , forget the reception the Old Lady give her ; but , be wise in her day and generation , she leave her card , say that if Miss Lloyd ever change her mind about sell the jug , she would find that she , the aforesaid collector , have not change hers about buy it .
People who make a hobby of heirloom china must meekly overlook snub , and this particular person have never see anything she covet so much a that grape jug .
The Old Lady have tear the card to piece ; but she remember the name and address .
She go to the cupboard and take down the beloved jug .
`` I never think to part with it , '' she say wistfully , `` but Sylvia must have a dress , and there be no other way .
And , after all , when I 'm go , who would there be to have it ?
Strangers would get it then -- it might as well go to them now .
I 'll have to go to town to-morrow morning , for there 's no time to lose if the party be Friday night .
I have n't be to town for ten year .
I dread the thought of go , more than part with the jug .
But for Sylvia 's sake ! ''
It be all over Spencervale by the next morning that Old Lady Lloyd have go to town , carry a carefully guard box .
Everybody wonder why she go ; most people suppose she have become too frightened to keep her money in a black box below her bed , when there have be two burglary over at Carmody , and have take it to the bank .
The Old Lady seek out the address of the china collector , tremble with fear that she might be dead or go .
But the collector be there , very much alive , and a keenly anxious to possess the grape jug a ever .
The Old Lady , pallid with the pain of her trampled pride , sell the grape jug and go away , believe that her great-grandmother must have turn over in her grave at the moment of the transaction .
Old Lady Lloyd felt like a traitor to her tradition .
But she go unflinchingly to a big store and , guide by that special Providence which look after simple-minded old soul in their dangerous excursion into the world , find a sympathetic clerk who know just what she want and get it for her .
The Old Lady select a very dainty muslin gown , with glove and slipper in keep ; and she order it send at once , expressage prepaid , to Miss Sylvia Gray , in care of William Spencer , Spencervale .
Then she pay down the money -- the whole price of the jug , minus a dollar and a half for railroad fare -- with a grand , careless air and depart .
As she march erectly down the aisle of the store , she encounter a sleek , portly , prosperous man come in .
As their eye meet , the man start and his bland face flush crimson ; he lift his hat and bow confusedly .
But the Old Lady look through him a if he be n't there , and pass on with not a sign of recognition about her .
He take one step after her , then stop and turn away , with a rather disagreeable smile and a shrug of his shoulder .
Nobody would have guess , a the Old Lady sweep out , how her heart be seethe with abhorrence and scorn .
She would not have have the courage to come to town , even for Sylvia 's sake , if she have think she would meet Andrew Cameron .
The mere sight of him open up anew a sealed fountain of bitterness in her soul ; but the thought of Sylvia somehow stem the torrent , and presently the Old Lady be smile rather triumphantly , think rightly that she have come off best in that unwelcome encounter .
SHE , at any rate , have not falter and colour , and lose her presence of mind .
`` It be little wonder HE do , '' think the Old Lady vindictively .
It please her that Andrew Cameron should lose , before her , the front of adamant he present to the world .
He be her cousin and the only living creature Old Lady Lloyd hat , and she hat and despise him with all the intensity of her intense nature .
She and hers have sustain grievous wrong at his hand , and the Old Lady be convince that she would rather die than take any notice of his existence .
Presently , she resolutely put Andrew Cameron out of her mind .
It be desecration to think of him and Sylvia together .
When she lay her weary head on her pillow that night she be so happy that even the thought of the vacant shelf in the room below , where the grape jug have always be , give her only a momentary pang .
`` It 's sweet to sacrifice for one we love -- it 's sweet to have someone to sacrifice for , '' think the Old Lady .
Desire grows by what it feed on .
The Old Lady think she be content ; but Friday evening come and find her in a perfect fever to see Sylvia in her party dress .
It be not enough to fancy her in it ; nothing would do the Old Lady but see her .
`` And I SHALL see her , '' say the Old Lady resolutely , look out from her window at Sylvia 's light gleam through the fir .
She wrap herself in a dark shawl and creep out , slip down to the hollow and up the wood lane .
It be a misty , moonlight night , and a wind , fragrant with the aroma of clover field , blow down the lane to meet her .
`` I wish I could take your perfume -- the soul of you -- and pour it into her life , '' say the Old Lady aloud to that wind .
Sylvia Gray be stand in her room , ready for the party .
Before her stood Mrs. Spencer and Amelia Spencer and all the little Spencer girl , in an admiring semi-circle .
There be another spectator .
Outside , under the lilac bush , Old Lady Lloyd be stand .
She could see Sylvia plainly , in her dainty dress , with the pale pink roses Old Lady Lloyd have leave at the beech that day for her in her hair .
Pink a they be , they be not so pink a her cheek , and her eye shine like star .
Amelia Spencer put up her hand to push back a rise that have fall a little out of place , and the Old Lady envy her fiercely .
`` That dress could n't have fit good if it have be make for you , '' say Mrs. Spencer admiringly .
`` Ai n't she lovely , Amelia ?
Who COULD have send it ? ''
`` Oh , I feel sure that Mrs. Moore be the fairy godmother , '' say Sylvia .
`` There be nobody else who would .
It be dear of her -- she know I wish so much to go to the party with Janet .
I wish Aunty could see me now . ''
Sylvia give a little sigh in spite of her joy .
`` There 's nobody else to care very much . ''
Ah , Sylvia , you be wrong !
There be somebody else -- somebody who care very much -- an Old Lady , with eager , devour eye , who be stand under the lilac bush and who presently steal away through the moonlit orchard to the wood like a shadow , go home with a vision of you in your girlish beauty to companion her through the watch of that summer night .
IV .
The August Chapter One day the minister 's wife rush in where Spencervale people have fear to tread , go boldly to Old Lady Lloyd , and ask her if she would n't come to their Sewing Circle , which meet fortnightly on Saturday afternoon .
`` We be fill a box to send to our Trinidad missionary , '' say the minister 's wife , `` and we should be so pleased to have you come , Miss Lloyd . ''
The Old Lady be on the point of refuse rather haughtily .
Not that she be oppose to mission -- or sew circle either -- quite the contrary , but she know that each member of the Circle be expect to pay ten cent a week for the purpose of procure sew material ; and the poor Old Lady really do not see how she could afford it .
But a sudden thought check her refusal before it reach her lip .
`` I suppose some of the young girl go to the Circle ? ''
she say craftily .
`` Oh , they all go , '' say the minister 's wife .
`` Janet Moore and Miss Gray be our most enthusiastic member .
It be very lovely of Miss Gray to give her Saturday afternoon -- the only one she have free from pupil -- to our work .
But she really have the sweet disposition . ''
`` I 'll join your Circle , '' say the Old Lady promptly .
She be determine she would do it , if she have to live on two meal a day to save the necessary fee .
She go to the Sewing Circle at James Martin 's the next Saturday , and do the most beautiful hand sew for them .
She be so expert at it that she do n't need to think about it at all , which be rather fortunate , for all her thought be take up with Sylvia , who sit in the opposite corner with Janet Moore , her graceful hand busy with a little boy 's coarse gingham shirt .
Nobody thought of introduce Sylvia to Old Lady Lloyd , and the Old Lady be glad of it .
She sew finely away , and listen with all her ear to the girlish chatter which go on in the opposite corner .
One thing she find out -- Sylvia 's birthday be the twentieth of August .
And the Old Lady be straightway fire with a consume wish to give Sylvia a birthday present .
She lay awake most of the night wonder if she could do it , and most sorrowfully conclude that it be utterly out of the question , no matter how she might pinch and contrive .
Old Lady Lloyd worry quite absurdly over this , and it haunt her like a spectre until the next Sewing Circle day .
It meet at Mrs. Moore 's and Mrs. Moore be especially gracious to Old Lady Lloyd , and insist on her take the wicker rocker in the parlour .
The Old Lady would rather have be in the sitting-room with the young girl , but she submit for courtesy 's sake -- and she have her reward .
Her chair be just behind the parlour door , and presently Janet Moore and Sylvia Gray come and sit on the stair in the hall outside , where a cool breeze blew in through the maple before the front door .
They be talk of their favourite poet .
Janet , it appear , adore Byron and Scott .
Sylvia lean to Tennyson and Browning .
`` Do you know , '' say Sylvia softly , `` my father be a poet ?
He publish a little volume of verse once ; and , Janet , I 've never see a copy of it , and oh , how I would love to !
It be publish when he be at college -- just a small , private edition to give his friend .
He never publish any more -- poor father !
I think life disappoint him .
But I have such a longing to see that little book of his verse .
I have n't a scrap of his writing .
If I have it would seem a if I possess something of him -- of his heart , his soul , his inner life .
He would be something more than a mere name to me . ''
`` Did n't he have a copy of his own -- do n't your mother have one ? ''
ask Janet .
`` Mother have n't .
She die when I be bear , you know , but Aunty say there be no copy of father 's poem among mother 's book .
Mother do n't care for poetry , Aunty say -- Aunty do n't either .
Father go to Europe after mother die , and he die there the next year .
Nothing that he have with him be ever send home to u .
He have sell most of his book before he go , but he give a few of his favourite one to Aunty to keep for me .
HIS book be n't among them .
I do n't suppose I shall ever find a copy , but I should be so delighted if I only could . ''
When the Old Lady get home she take from her top bureau drawer an inlaid box of sandalwood .
It hold a little , slim , limp volume , wrap in tissue paper -- the Old Lady 's most treasured possession .
On the fly-leaf be write , `` To Margaret , with the author 's love . ''
The Old Lady turn the yellow leaf with tremble finger and , through eye brim with tear , read the verse , although she have know them all by heart for year .
She mean to give the book to Sylvia for a birthday present -- one of the most precious gift ever give , if the value of gift be gauge by the measure of self-sacrifice involve .
In that little book be immortal love -- old laughter -- old tear -- old beauty which have bloom like a rise year ago , hold still it sweetness like old rise leaf .
She remove the telltale fly-leaf ; and late on the night before Sylvia 's birthday , the Old Lady crept , under cover of the darkness , through byway and across field , a if bent on some nefarious expedition , to the little Spencervale store where the post-office be keep .
She slip the thin parcel through the slit in the door , and then steal home again , feel a strange sense of loss and loneliness .
It be a if she have give away the last link between herself and her youth .
But she do not regret it .
It would give Sylvia pleasure , and that have come to be the overmastering passion of the Old Lady 's heart .
The next night the light in Sylvia 's room burn very late , and the Old Lady watch it triumphantly , know the meaning of it .
Sylvia be read her father 's poem , and the Old Lady in her darkness read them too , murmur the line over and over to herself .
After all , give away the book have not matter so very much .
She have the soul of it still -- and the fly-leaf with the name , in Leslie 's writing , by which nobody ever call her now .
The Old Lady be sit on the Marshall sofa the next Sewing Circle afternoon when Sylvia Gray come and sit down beside her .
The Old Lady 's hand tremble a little , and one side of a handkerchief , which be afterwards give a a Christmas present to a little olive-skinned coolie in Trinidad , be not quite so exquisitely do a the other three side .
Sylvia at first talked of the Circle , and Mrs. Marshall 's dahlia , and the Old Lady be in the seventh heaven of delight , though she take care not to show it , and be even a little more stately and finely mannered than usual .
When she ask Sylvia how she like live in Spencervale , Sylvia say , `` Very much .
Everybody be so kind to me .
Besides '' -- Sylvia lower her voice so that nobody but the Old Lady could hear it -- `` I have a fairy godmother here who do the most beautiful and wonderful thing for me . ''
Sylvia , be a girl of fine instinct , do not look at Old Lady Lloyd a she say this .
But she would not have see anything if she have look .
The Old Lady be not a Lloyd for nothing .
`` How very interesting , '' she say , indifferently .
`` Is n't it ?
I be so grateful to her and I have wish so much she might know how much pleasure she have give me .
I have find lovely flower and delicious berry on my path all summer ; I feel sure she send me my party dress .
But the dear gift come last week on my birthday -- a little volume of my father 's poem .
I ca n't express what I felt on receive them .
But I long to meet my fairy godmother and thank her . ''
`` Quite a fascinating mystery , be n't it ?
Have you really no idea who she be ? ''
The Old Lady ask this dangerous question with marked success .
She would not have be so successful if she have not be so sure that Sylvia have no idea of the old romance between her and Leslie Gray .
As it be , she have a comfortable conviction that she herself be the very last person Sylvia would be likely to suspect .
Sylvia hesitate for an almost unnoticeable moment .
Then she say , `` I have n't try to find out , because I do n't think she want me to know .
At first , of course , in the matter of the flower and dress , I do try to solve the mystery ; but , since I receive the book , I become convinced that it be my fairy godmother who be do it all , and I have respect her wish for concealment and always shall .
Perhaps some day she will reveal herself to me .
I hope so , at least . ''
`` I would n't hope it , '' say the Old Lady discouragingly .
`` Fairy godmother -- at least , in all the fairy tale I ever read -- be somewhat apt to be queer , crochety people , much more agreeable when wrap up in mystery than when met face to face . ''
`` I 'm convinced that mine be the very opposite , and that the good I become acquainted with her , the more charm a personage I should find her , '' say Sylvia gaily .
Mrs. Marshall come up at this juncture and entreat Miss Gray to sing for them .
Miss Gray consent sweetly , the Old Lady be leave alone and be rather glad of it .
She enjoy her conversation with Sylvia much more in think it over after she get home than while it be take place .
When an Old Lady have a guilty conscience , it be apt to make her nervous and distract her thought from immediate pleasure .
She wonder a little uneasily if Sylvia really do suspect her .
Then she conclude that it be out of the question .
Who would suspect a mean , unsociable Old Lady , who have no friend , and who give only five cent to the Sewing Circle when everyone else give ten or fifteen , to be a fairy godmother , the donor of beautiful party dress , and the recipient of gift from romantic , aspire young poet ?
V .
The September Chapter In September the Old Lady look back on the summer and own to herself that it have be a strangely happy one , with Sundays and Sewing Circle day stand out like golden punctuation mark in a poem of life .
She felt like an utterly different woman ; and other people think her different also .
The Sewing Circle woman find her so pleasant , and even friendly , that they begin to think they have misjudge her , and that perhaps it be eccentricity after all , and not meanness , which account for her peculiar mode of living .
Sylvia Gray always come and talk to her on Circle afternoon now , and the Old Lady treasure every word she say in her heart and repeat them over and over to her lonely self in the watch of the night .
Sylvia never talk of herself or her plan , unless ask about them ; and the Old Lady 's self-consciousness prevent her from ask any personal question : so their conversation keep to the surface of thing , and it be not from Sylvia , but from the minister 's wife that the Old Lady finally discover what her darling 's dear ambition be .
The minister 's wife have drop in at the old Lloyd place one evening late in September , when a chilly wind be blow up from the northeast and moan about the eaves of the house , a if the burden of it lay be `` harvest be end and summer be go . ''
The Old Lady have be listen to it , a she plait a little basket of sweet grass for Sylvia .
She have walk all the way to Avonlea sand-hills for it the day before , and she be very tired .
And her heart be sad .
This summer , which have so enrich her life , be almost over ; and she know that Sylvia Gray talk of leave Spencervale at the end of October .
The Old Lady 's heart felt like very lead within her at the thought , and she almost welcome the advent of the minister 's wife a a distraction , although she be desperately afraid that the minister 's wife have call to ask for a subscription for the new vestry carpet , and the Old Lady simply could not afford to give one cent .
But the minister 's wife have merely drop in on her way home from the Spencers ' and she do not make any embarrassing request .
Instead , she talk about Sylvia Gray , and her word fell on the Old Lady 's ear like separate pearl note of unutterably sweet music .
The minister 's wife have nothing but praise for Sylvia -- she be so sweet and beautiful and win .
`` And with SUCH a voice , '' say the minister 's wife enthusiastically , add with a sigh , `` It 's such a shame she ca n't have it properly train .
She would certainly become a great singer -- competent critic have tell her so .
But she be so poor she do n't think she can ever possibly manage it -- unless she can get one of the Cameron scholarship , a they be call ; and she have very little hope of that , although the professor of music who teach her have send her name in . ''
`` What be the Cameron scholarship ? ''
ask the Old Lady .
`` Well , I suppose you have hear of Andrew Cameron , the millionaire ? ''
say the minister 's wife , serenely unconscious that she be cause the very bone of the Old Lady 's family skeleton to jangle in their closet .
Into the Old Lady 's white face come a sudden faint stain of colour , a if a rough hand have strike her cheek .
`` Yes , I 've hear of him , '' she say .
`` Well , it seem that he have a daughter , who be a very beautiful girl , and whom he idolize .
She have a fine voice , and he be go to send her abroad to have it train .
And she die .
It nearly break his heart , I understand .
But ever since , he send one young girl away to Europe every year for a thorough musical education under the best teacher -- in memory of his daughter .
He have send nine or ten already ; but I fear there be n't much chance for Sylvia Gray , and she do n't think there be herself . ''
`` Why not ? ''
ask the Old Lady spiritedly .
`` I be sure that there can be few voice equal to Miss Gray 's . ''
`` Very true .
But you see , these so-called scholarship be private affair , dependent solely on the whim and choice of Andrew Cameron himself .
Of course , when a girl have friend who use their influence with him , he will often send her on their recommendation .
They say he send a girl last year who have n't much of a voice at all just because her father have be an old business crony of his .
But Sylvia do n't know anyone at all who would , to use a slang term , have any ` pull ' with Andrew Cameron , and she be not acquaint with him herself .
Well , I must be go ; we 'll see you at the Manse on Saturday , I hope , Miss Lloyd .
The Circle meet there , you know . ''
`` Yes , I know , '' say the Old Lady absently .
When the minister 's wife have go , she drop her sweetgrass basket and sat for a long , long time with her hand lie idly in her lap , and her big black eye star unseeingly at the wall before her .
Old Lady Lloyd , so pitifully poor that she have to eat six cracker the less a week to pay her fee to the Sewing Circle , know that it be in her power -- HERS -- to send Leslie Gray 's daughter to Europe for her musical education !
If she choose to use her `` pull '' with Andrew Cameron -- if she go to him and ask him to send Sylvia Gray abroad the next year -- she have no doubt whatever that it would be do .
It all lay with her -- if -- if -- IF she could so far crush and conquer her pride a to stoop to ask a favour of the man who have wrong her and hers so bitterly .
Years ago , her father , act under the advice and urgency of Andrew Cameron , have invest all his little fortune in an enterprise that have turn out a failure .
Abraham Lloyd lose every dollar he possess , and his family be reduce to utter poverty .
Andrew Cameron might have be forgive for a mistake ; but there be a strong suspicion , amount to almost certainty , that he have be guilty of something far bad than a mistake in regard to his uncle 's investment .
Nothing could be legally prove ; but it be certain that Andrew Cameron , already note for his `` sharp practice , '' emerge with improved finance from an entanglement that have ruin many good men ; and old Doctor Lloyd have die brokenhearted , believe that his nephew have deliberately victimize him .
Andrew Cameron have not quite do this ; he have mean well enough by his uncle at first , and what he have finally do he try to justify to himself by the doctrine that a man must look out for Number One .
Margaret Lloyd make no such excuse for him ; she hold him responsible , not only for her lose fortune , but for her father 's death , and never forgive him for it .
When Abraham Lloyd have die , Andrew Cameron , perhaps prick by his conscience , have come to her , sleekly and smoothly , to offer her financial aid .
He would see , he tell her , that she never suffer want .
Margaret Lloyd fling his offer back in his face after a fashion that leave nothing to be desire in the way of plain speaking .
She would die , she tell him passionately , before she would accept a penny or a favour from him .
He have preserve an unbroken show of good temper , express his heartfelt regret that she should cherish such an unjust opinion of him , and have leave her with an oily assurance that he would always be her friend , and would always be delight to render her any assistance in his power whenever she should choose to ask for it .
The Old Lady have live for twenty year in the firm conviction that she would die in the poorhouse -- a , indeed , seem not unlikely -- before she would ask a favour of Andrew Cameron .
And so , in truth , she would have , have it be for herself .
But for Sylvia !
Could she so far humble herself for Sylvia 's sake ?
The question be not easily or speedily settle , a have be the case in the matter of the grape jug and the book of poem .
For a whole week the Old Lady fight her pride and bitterness .
Sometimes , in the hour of sleepless night , when all human resentment and rancour seem petty and contemptible , she think she have conquer it .
But in the daytime , with the picture of her father look down at her from the wall , and the rustle of her unfashionable dress , worn because of Andrew Cameron 's double dealing , in her ear , it get the good of her again .
But the Old Lady 's love for Sylvia have grow so strong and deep and tender that no other feeling could endure finally against it .
Love be a great miracle worker ; and never have it power be more strongly make manifest than on the cold , dull autumn morning when the Old Lady walk to Bright River railway station and take the train to Charlottetown , bent on an errand the very thought of which turn her soul sick within her .
The station master who sell her her ticket think Old Lady Lloyd look uncommonly white and peak -- `` a if she have n't sleep a wink or eat a bite for a week , '' he tell his wife at dinner time .
`` Guess there 's something wrong in her business affair .
This be the second time she 's go to town this summer . ''
When the Old Lady reach the town , she eat her slender little lunch and then walk out to the suburb where the Cameron factory and warehouse be .
It be a long walk for her , but she could not afford to drive .
She felt very tired when she be show into the shining , luxurious office where Andrew Cameron sit at his desk .
After the first startle glance of surprise , he come forward beamingly , with outstretched hand .
`` Why , Cousin Margaret !
This be a pleasant surprise .
Sit down -- allow me , this be a much more comfortable chair .
Did you come in this morning ?
And how be everybody out in Spencervale ? ''
The Old Lady have flush at his first word .
To hear the name by which her father and mother and lover have call her on Andrew Cameron 's lip seem like profanation .
But , she tell herself , the time be past for squeamishness .
If she could ask a favour of Andrew Cameron , she could bear less pang .
For Sylvia 's sake she shake hand with him , for Sylvia 's sake she sit down in the chair he offer .
But for no living human be 's sake could this determine Old Lady infuse any cordiality into her manner or her word .
She go straight to the point with Lloyd simplicity .
`` I have come to ask a favour of you , '' she say , look him in the eye , not at all humbly or meekly , a become a suppliant , but challengingly and defiantly , a if she dare him to refuse .
`` DE-lighted to hear it , Cousin Margaret . ''
Never be anything so bland and gracious a his tone .
`` Anything I can do for you I shall be only too pleased to do .
I be afraid you have look upon me a an enemy , Margaret , and I assure you I have felt your injustice keenly .
I realize that some appearance be against me , but -- '' The Old Lady lift her hand and stem his eloquence by that one gesture .
`` I do not come here to discuss that matter , '' she say .
`` We will not refer to the past , if you please .
I come to ask a favour , not for myself , but for a very dear young friend of mine -- a Miss Gray , who have a remarkably fine voice which she wish to have train .
She be poor , so I come to ask you if you would give her one of your musical scholarship .
I understand her name have already be suggest to you , with a recommendation from her teacher .
I do not know what he have say of her voice , but I do know he could hardly overrate it .
If you send her abroad for training , you will not make any mistake . ''
The Old Lady stop talk .
She felt sure Andrew Cameron would grant her request , but she do hope he would grant it rather rudely or unwillingly .
She could accept the favour so much more easily if it be flung to her like a bone to a dog .
But not a bit of it .
Andrew Cameron be suaver than ever .
Nothing could give him great pleasure than to grant his dear Cousin Margaret 's request -- he only wish it involve more trouble on his part .
Her little protege should have her musical education assuredly -- she should go abroad next year -- and he be DE-lighted -- `` Thank you , '' say the Old Lady , cut him short again .
`` I be much oblige to you -- and I ask you not to let Miss Gray know anything of my interference .
And I shall not take up any more of your valuable time .
Good afternoon . ''
`` Oh , you must n't go so soon , '' he say , with some real kindness or clannishness permeate the hateful cordiality of his voice -- for Andrew Cameron be not entirely without the homely virtue of the average man .
He have be a good husband and father ; he have once be very fond of his Cousin Margaret ; and he be really very sorry that `` circumstance '' have `` compel '' him to act a he have do in that old affair of her father 's investment .
`` You must be my guest to-night . ''
`` Thank you .
I must return home to-night , '' say the Old Lady firmly , and there be that in her tone which tell Andrew Cameron that it would be useless to urge her .
But he insist on telephone for his carriage to drive her to the station .
The Old Lady submit to this , because she be secretly afraid her own leg would not suffice to carry her there ; she even shake hand with him at parting , and thank him a second time for grant her request .
`` Not at all , '' he say .
`` Please try to think a little more kindly of me , Cousin Margaret . ''
When the Old Lady reach the station she find , to her dismay , that her train have just go and that she would have to wait two hour for the even one .
She go into the waiting-room and sit down .
She be very tired .
All the excitement that have sustain her be go , and she felt weak and old .
She have nothing to eat , have expect to get home in time for tea ; the waiting-room be chilly , and she shiver in her thin , old , silk mantilla .
Her head ache and her heart likewise .
She have win Sylvia 's desire for her ; but Sylvia would go out of her life , and the Old Lady do not see how she be to go on living after that .
Yet she sit there unflinchingly for two hour , an upright , indomitable old figure , silently fight her losing battle with the force of physical and mental pain , while happy people come and go , and laugh and talk before her .
At eight o'clock the Old Lady get off the train at Bright River station , and slip off unnoticed into the darkness of the wet night .
She have two mile to walk , and a cold rain be fall .
Soon the Old Lady be wet to the skin and chill to the marrow .
She felt a if she be walk in a bad dream .
Blind instinct alone guide her over the last mile and up the lane to her own house .
As she fumble at her door , she realize that a burning heat have suddenly take the place of her chilliness .
She stumble in over her threshold and close the door .
VI .
The October Chapter On the second morning after Old Lady Lloyd 's journey to town , Sylvia Gray be walk blithely down the wood lane .
It be a beautiful autumn morning , clear and crisp and sunny ; the frosted fern , drench and batter with the rain of yesterday , give out a delicious fragrance ; here and there in the wood a maple wave a gay crimson banner , or a branch of birch show pale golden against the dark , unchanging spruce .
The air be very pure and exhilarating .
Sylvia walk with a joyous lightness of step and uplift of brow .
At the beech in the hollow she pause for an expectant moment , but there be nothing among the gray old root for her .
She be just turn away when little Teddy Kimball , who live next door to the manse , come run down the slope from the direction of the old Lloyd place .
Teddy 's freckled face be very pale .
`` Oh , Miss Gray ! ''
he gasp .
`` I guess Old Lady Lloyd have go clean crazy at last .
The minister 's wife ask me to run up to the Old Lady , with a message about the Sewing Circle -- and I knock -- and knock -- and nobody come -- so I think I 'd just step in and leave the letter on the table .
But when I open the door , I hear an awful queer laugh in the sitting-room , and next minute , the Old Lady come to the sitting-room door .
Oh , Miss Gray , she look awful .
Her face be red and her eye awful wild -- and she be mutter and talk to herself and laugh like mad .
I be so scared I just turn and run . ''
Sylvia , without stop for reflection , catch Teddy 's hand and run up the slope .
It do not occur to her to be frighten , although she think with Teddy that the poor , lonely , eccentric Old Lady have really go out of her mind at last .
The Old Lady be sit on the kitchen sofa when Sylvia enter .
Teddy , too frighten to go in , lurk on the step outside .
The Old Lady still wear the damp black silk dress in which she have walk from the station .
Her face be flush , her eye wild , her voice hoarse .
But she know Sylvia and cower down .
`` Do n't look at me , '' she moan .
`` Please go away -- I ca n't bear that YOU should know how poor I be .
You 're to go to Europe -- Andrew Cameron be go to send you -- I ask him -- he could n't refuse ME .
But please go away . ''
Sylvia do not go away .
At a glance she have see that this be sickness and delirium , not insanity .
She send Teddy off in hot haste for Mrs. Spencer and when Mrs. Spencer come they induce the Old Lady to go to bed , and send for the doctor .
By night everybody in Spencervale know that Old Lady Lloyd have pneumonia .
Mrs. Spencer announce that she mean to stay and nurse the Old Lady .
Several other woman offer assistance .
Everybody be kind and thoughtful .
But the Old Lady do not know it .
She do not even know Sylvia Gray , who come and sat by her every minute she could spare .
Sylvia Gray now know all that she have suspect -- the Old Lady be her fairy godmother .
The Old Lady babble of Sylvia incessantly , reveal all her love for her , betray all the sacrifice she have make .
Sylvia 's heart ache with love and tenderness , and she pray earnestly that the Old Lady might recover .
`` I want her to know that I give her love for love , '' she murmur .
Everybody know now how poor the Old Lady really be .
She let slip all the jealously guarded secret of her existence , except her old love for Leslie Gray .
Even in delirium something seal her lip a to that .
But all else come out -- her anguish over her unfashionable attire , her pitiful makeshift and contrivance , her humiliation over wear unfashionable dress and pay only five cent where every other Sewing Circle member pay ten .
The kindly woman who wait on her listened to her with tear-filled eye , and repent of their harsh judgment in the past .
`` But who would have think it ? ''
say Mrs. Spencer to the minister 's wife .
`` Nobody ever dream that her father have lose ALL his money , though folk suppose he have lose some in that old affair of the silver mine out west .
It 's shock to think of the way she have live all these year , often with not enough to eat -- and go to bed in winter day to save fuel .
Though I suppose if we have know we could n't have do much for her , she 's so desperate proud .
But if she live , and will let u help her , thing will be different after this .
Crooked Jack say he 'll never forgive himself for take pay for the few little job he do for her .
He say , if she 'll only let him , he 'll do everything she want do for her after this for nothing .
Ai n't it strange what a fancy she 's take to Miss Gray ?
Think of her do all those thing for her all summer , and sell the grape jug and all .
Well , the Old Lady certainly be n't mean , but nobody make a mistake in call her queer .
It all do seem desperate pitiful .
Miss Gray 's take it awful hard .
She seem to think about as much of the Old Lady a the Old Lady think of her .
She 's so work up she do n't even seem to care about go to Europe next year .
She 's really go -- she 's have word from Andrew Cameron .
I 'm awful glad , for there never be a sweeter girl in the world ; but she say it will cost too much if the Old Lady 's life be to pay for it . ''
Andrew Cameron heard of the Old Lady 's illness and come out to Spencervale himself .
He be not allow to see the Old Lady , of course ; but he tell all concern that no expense or trouble be to be spar , and the Spencervale doctor be instruct to send his bill to Andrew Cameron and hold his peace about it .
Moreover , when Andrew Cameron go back home , he send a trained nurse out to wait on the Old Lady , a capable , kindly woman who contrive to take charge of the case without offend Mrs. Spencer -- than which no high tribute could be pay to her tact !
The Old Lady do not die -- the Lloyd constitution bring her through .
One day , when Sylvia come in , the Old Lady smile up at her , with a weak , faint , sensible smile , and murmur her name , and the nurse say that the crisis be past .
The Old Lady make a marvellously patient and tractable invalid .
She do just a she be tell , and accept the presence of the nurse a a matter of course .
But one day , when she be strong enough to talk a little , she say to Sylvia , `` I suppose Andrew Cameron send Miss Hayes here , do he ? ''
`` Yes , '' say Sylvia , rather timidly .
The Old Lady notice the timidity and smile , with something of her old humour and spirit in her black eye .
`` Time have be when I 'd have pack off unceremoniously any person Andrew Cameron send here , '' she say .
`` But , Sylvia , I have go through the Valley of the Shadow of Death , and I have leave pride and resentment behind me for ever , I hope .
I no longer feel a I felt towards Andrew .
I can even accept a personal favour from him now .
At last I can forgive him for the wrong he do me and mine .
Sylvia , I find that I have be let no end of cat out of bag in my illness .
Everybody know now how poor I be -- but I do n't seem to mind it a bit .
I 'm only sorry that I ever shut my neighbour out of my life because of my foolish pride .
Everyone have be so kind to me , Sylvia .
In the future , if my life be spar , it be go to be a very different sort of life .
I 'm go to open it to all the kindness and companionship I can find in young and old .
I 'm go to help them all I can and let them help me .
I CAN help people -- I 've learn that money be n't the only power for help people .
Anyone who have sympathy and understand to give have a treasure that be without money and without price .
And oh , Sylvia , you 've find out what I never mean you to know .
But I do n't mind that now , either . ''
Sylvia take the Old Lady 's thin white hand and kiss it .
`` I can never thank you enough for what you have do for me , dear Miss Lloyd , '' she say earnestly .
`` And I be so glad that all mystery be do away with between u , and I can love you a much and as openly a I have long to do .
I be so glad and so thankful that you love me , dear fairy godmother . ''
`` Do you know WHY I love you so ? ''
say the Old Lady wistfully .
`` Did I let THAT out in my raving , too ? ''
`` No , but I think I know .
It be because I be Leslie Gray 's daughter , be n't it ?
I know that father love you -- his brother , Uncle Willis , tell me all about it . ''
`` I spoil my own life because of my wicked pride , '' say the Old Lady sadly .
`` But you will love me in spite of it all , wo n't you , Sylvia ?
And you will come to see me sometimes ?
And write me after you go away ? ''
`` I be come to see you every day , '' say Sylvia .
`` I be go to stay in Spencervale for a whole year yet , just to be near you .
And next year when I go to Europe -- thanks to you , fairy godmother -- I 'll write you every day .
We be go to be the best of chum , and we be go to have a most beautiful year of comradeship ! ''
The Old Lady smile contentedly .
Out in the kitchen , the minister 's wife , who have bring up a dish of jelly , be talk to Mrs. Spencer about the Sewing Circle .
Through the open window , where the red vine hung , come the pungent , sun-warm October air .
The sunshine fell over Sylvia 's chestnut hair like a crown of glory and youth .
`` I do feel so perfectly happy , '' say the Old Lady , with a long , rapturous breath .
III .
Each In His Own Tongue The honey-tinted autumn sunshine be fall thickly over the crimson and amber maple around old Abel Blair 's door .
There be only one outer door in old Abel 's house , and it almost always stand wide open .
A little black dog , with one ear miss and a lame forepaw , almost always sleep on the worn red sandstone slab which serve old Abel for a doorstep ; and on the still more worn sill above it a large gray cat almost always sleep .
Just inside the door , on a bandy-legged chair of elder day , old Abel almost always sit .
He be sit there this afternoon -- a little old man , sadly twist with rheumatism ; his head be abnormally large , thatch with long , wiry black hair ; his face be heavily line and swarthily sunburn ; his eye be deep-set and black , with occasional peculiar golden flash in them .
A strange look man be old Abel Blair ; and a strange be he a he look .
Lower Carmody people would have tell you .
Old Abel be almost always sober in these , his late year .
He be sober to-day .
He like to bask in that ripe sunlight as well a his dog and cat do ; and in such baskings he almost always look out of his doorway at the far , fine blue sky over the top of the crowding maple .
But to-day he be not look at the sky , instead , he be star at the black , dusty rafter of his kitchen , where hung dry meat and string of onion and bunch of herb and fishing tackle and gun and skin .
But old Abel saw not these thing ; his face be the face of a man who behold vision , compact of heavenly pleasure and hellish pain , for old Abel be see what he might have be -- and what he be ; a he always saw when Felix Moore play to him on the violin .
And the awful joy of dream that he be young again , with unspoiled life before him , be so great and compel that it counterbalance the agony in the realization of a dishonoured old age , follow year in which he have squander the wealth of his soul in way where Wisdom lift not her voice .
Felix Moore be stand opposite to him , before an untidy stove , where the noon fire have die down into pallid , scattered ash .
Under his chin he hold old Abel 's brown , batter fiddle ; his eye , too , be fix on the ceiling ; and he , too , saw thing not lawful to be utter in any language save that of music ; and of all music , only that give forth by the anguished , enraptured spirit of the violin .
And yet this Felix be little more than twelve year old , and his face be still the face of a child who know nothing of either sorrow or sin or failure or remorse .
Only in his large , gray-black eye be there something not of the child -- something that spoke of an inheritance from many heart , now ash , which have aforetime grieve and joy , and struggle and fail , and succeed and grovel .
The inarticulate cry of their longing have pass into this child 's soul , and transmute themselves into the expression of his music .
Felix be a beautiful child .
Carmody people , who stay at home , think so ; and old Abel Blair , who have roam afar in many land , think so ; and even the Rev . Stephen Leonard , who teach , and try to believe , that favour be deceitful and beauty be vain , think so .
He be a slight lad , with slop shoulder , a slim brown neck , and a head set on it with stag-like grace and uplift .
His hair , cut straight across his brow and fall over his ear , after some caprice of Janet Andrews , the minister 's housekeeper , be a glossy blue-black .
The skin of his face and hand be like ivory ; his eye be large and beautifully tint -- gray , with dilate pupil ; his feature have the outline of a cameo .
Carmody mother consider him delicate , and have long foretold that the minister would never bring him up ; but old Abel pull his grizzled moustache when he hear such foreboding and smile .
`` Felix Moore will live , '' he say positively .
`` You ca n't kill that kind until their work be do .
He 's get a work to do -- if the minister 'll let him do it .
And if the minister do n't let him do it , then I would n't be in that minister 's shoe when he come to the judgment -- no , I 'd rather be in my own .
It 's an awful thing to cross the purpose of the Almighty , either in your own life or anybody else 's .
Sometimes I think it 's what 's mean by the unpardonable sin -- ay , that I do ! ''
Carmody people never ask what old Abel meant .
They have long ago give up such vain questioning .
When a man have live a old Abel have live for the great part of his life , be it any wonder he say crazy thing ?
And a for hint that Mr. Leonard , a man who be really almost too good to live , be guilty of any sin , much less an unpardonable one -- well , there now !
what use be it to be take any account of old Abel 's queer speech ?
Though , to be sure , there be no great harm in a fiddle , and maybe Mr. Leonard be a mite too strict that way with the child .
But then , could you wonder at it ?
There be his father , you see .
Felix finally lower the violin , and come back to old Abel 's kitchen with a long sigh .
Old Abel smile drearily at him -- the smile of a man who have be in the hand of the tormentor .
`` It 's awful the way you play -- it 's awful , '' he say with a shudder .
`` I never hear anything like it -- and you that never have any teaching since you be nine year old , and not much practice , except what you could get here now and then on my old , batter fiddle .
And to think you make it up yourself a you go along !
I suppose your grandfather would never hear to your study music -- would he now ? ''
Felix shake his head .
`` I know he would n't , Abel .
He want me to be a minister .
Ministers be good thing to be , but I 'm afraid I ca n't be a minister . ''
`` Not a pulpit minister .
There 's different kind of minister , and each must talk to men in his own tongue if he 's go to do 'em any real good , '' say old Abel meditatively .
`` YOUR tongue be music .
Strange that your grandfather ca n't see that for himself , and him such a broad-minded man !
He 's the only minister I ever have much use for .
He 's God 's own if ever a man be .
And he love you -- yes , sir , he love you like the apple of his eye . ''
`` And I love him , '' say Felix warmly .
`` I love him so much that I 'll even try to be a minister for his sake , though I do n't want to be . ''
`` What do you want to be ? ''
`` A great violinist , '' answer the child , his ivory-hued face suddenly warm into living rise .
`` I want to play to thousand -- and see their eye look a yours do when I play .
Sometimes your eye frighten me , but oh , it 's a splendid fright !
If I have father 's violin I could do good .
I remember that he once say it have a soul that be do purgatory for it sin when it have live on earth .
I do n't know what he mean , but it do seem to me that HIS violin be alive .
He teach me to play on it as soon a I be big enough to hold it . ''
`` Did you love your father ? ''
ask old Abel , with a keen look .
Again Felix crimson ; but he look straightly and steadily into his old friend 's face .
`` No , '' he say , `` I do n't ; but , '' he add , gravely and deliberately , `` I do n't think you should have ask me such a question . ''
It be old Abel 's turn to blush .
Carmody people would not have believe he could blush ; and perhaps no living be could have call that deepen hue into his weather-beaten cheek save only this gray-eyed child of the rebuke face .
`` No , I guess I should n't , '' he say .
`` But I 'm always make mistake .
I 've never make anything else .
That 's why I 'm nothing more than ` Old Abel ' to the Carmody people .
Nobody but you and your grandfather ever call me ` Mr. Blair . '
Yet William Blair at the store up there , rich and respect a he be , be n't half a clever a man a I be when we start in life : you may n't believe that , but it 's true .
And the bad of it be , young Felix , that most of the time I do n't care whether I 'm Mr. Blair of old Abel .
Only when you play I care .
It make me feel just a a look I saw in a little girl 's eye some year ago make me feel .
Her name be Anne Shirley and she live with the Cuthberts down at Avonlea .
We get into a conversation at Blair 's store .
She could talk a blue streak to anyone , that girl could .
I happen to say about something that it do n't matter to a batter old hulk of sixty odd like me .
She look at me with her big , innocent eye , a little reproachful like , a if I 'd say something awful heretical .
` Do n't you think , Mr. Blair , ' she say , ` that the old we get the more thing ought to matter to u ? '
-- as grave a if she 'd be a hundred instead of eleven .
` Things matter SO much to me now , ' she say , clasp her hand thisaway , ` and I 'm sure that when I 'm sixty they 'll matter just five time as much to me . '
Well , the way she look and the way she speak make me feel downright ashamed of myself because thing have stop matter with me .
But never mind all that .
My miserable old feeling do n't count for much .
What come of your father 's fiddle ? ''
`` Grandfather take it away when I come here .
I think he burn it .
And I long for it so often . ''
`` Well , you 've always get my old brown fiddle to come to when you must . ''
`` Yes , I know .
And I 'm glad for that .
But I 'm hungry for a violin all the time .
And I only come here when the hunger get too much to bear .
I feel a if I ought n't to come even then -- I 'm always say I wo n't do it again , because I know grandfather would n't like it , if he know . ''
`` He have never forbid it , have he ? ''
`` No , but that be because he do n't know I come here for that .
He never think of such a thing .
I feel sure he WOULD forbid it , if he know .
And that make me very wretched .
And yet I HAVE to come .
Mr. Blair , do you know why grandfather ca n't bear to have me play on the violin ?
He love music , and he do n't mind my play on the organ , if I do n't neglect other thing .
I ca n't understand it , can you ? ''
`` I have a pretty good idea , but I ca n't tell you .
It be n't my secret .
Maybe he 'll tell you himself some day .
But , mark you , young Felix , he have get good reason for it all .
Knowing what I know , I ca n't blame him over much , though I think he 's mistake .
Come now , play something more for me before you go -- something that 's bright and happy this time , so a to leave me with a good taste in my mouth .
That last thing you play take me straight to heaven , -- but heaven 's awful near to hell , and at the last you tip me in . ''
`` I do n't understand you , '' say Felix , draw his fine , narrow black brows together in a perplexed frown .
`` No -- and I would n't want you to .
You could n't understand unless you be an old man who have it in him once to do something and be a MAN , and just go and make himself a devilish fool .
But there must be something in you that understand thing -- all kind of thing -- or you could n't put it all into music the way you do .
How do you do it ?
How in -- how DO you do it , young Felix ? ''
`` I do n't know .
But I play differently to different people .
I do n't know how that be .
When I 'm alone with you I have to play one way ; and when Janet come over here to listen I feel quite another way -- not so thrilling , but happy and lonelier .
And that day when Jessie Blair be here listen I felt a if I want to laugh and sing -- a if the violin want to laugh and sing all the time . ''
The strange , golden gleam flash through old Abel 's sunken eye .
`` God , '' he mutter under his breath , `` I believe the boy can get into other folk 's souls somehow , and play out what HIS soul see there . ''
`` What 's that you say ? ''
inquired Felix , pet his fiddle .
`` Nothing -- never mind -- go on .
Something lively now , young Felix .
Stop probing into my soul , where you have n't no business to be , you infant , and play me something out of your own -- something sweet and happy and pure . ''
`` I 'll play the way I feel on sunshiny morning , when the bird be sing and I forget I have to be a minister , '' say Felix simply .
A witching , gurgling , mirthful strain , like mingle bird and brook song , float out on the still air , along the path where the red and golden maple leaf be fall very softly , one by one .
The Reverend Stephen Leonard hear it , a he come along the way , and the Reverend Stephen Leonard smile .
Now , when Stephen Leonard smile , child run to him , and grown people felt a if they look from Pisgah over to some fair land of promise beyond the fret and worry of their care-dimmed earthly life .
Mr. Leonard love music , a he love all thing beautiful , whether in the material or the spiritual world , though he do not realize how much he love them for their beauty alone , or he would have be shock and remorseful .
He himself be beautiful .
His figure be erect and youthful , despite seventy year .
His face be a mobile and charm a a woman 's , yet with all a man 's tried strength and firmness in it , and his dark blue eye flash with the brilliance of one and twenty ; even his silken silvery hair could not make an old man of him .
He be worship by everyone who know him , and he be , in so far a mortal man may be , worthy of that worship .
`` Old Abel be amuse himself with his violin again , '' he think .
`` What a delicious thing he be play !
He have quite a gift for the violin .
But how can he play such a thing a that , -- a battered old hulk of a man who have , at one time or another , wallow in almost every sin to which human nature can sink ?
He be on one of his spree three day ago -- the first one for over a year -- lie dead-drunk in the market square in Charlottetown among the dog ; and now he be play something that only a young archangel on the hill of heaven ought to be able to play .
Well , it will make my task all the easy .
Abel be always repentant by the time he be able to play on his fiddle . ''
Mr. Leonard be on the door-stone .
The little black dog have frisk down to meet him , and the gray cat rub her head against his leg .
Old Abel do not notice him ; he be beat time with uplifted hand and smile face to Felix 's music , and his eye be young again , glow with laughter and sheer happiness .
`` Felix !
what do this mean ? ''
The violin bow clatter from Felix 's hand upon the floor ; he swing around and face his grandfather .
As he meet the passion of grief and hurt in the old man 's eye , his own cloud with an agony of repentance .
`` Grandfather -- I 'm sorry , '' he cry brokenly .
`` Now , now ! ''
Old Abel have rise deprecatingly .
`` It 's all my fault , Mr. Leonard .
Do n't you blame the boy .
I coax him to play a bit for me .
I do n't feel fit to touch the fiddle yet myself -- too soon after Friday , you see .
So I coax him on -- would n't give him no peace till he play .
It 's all my fault . ''
`` No , '' say Felix , throw back his head .
His face be as white a marble , yet it seem ablaze with desperate truth and scorn of old Abel 's shield lie .
`` No , grandfather , it be n't Abel 's fault .
I come over here on purpose to play , because I think you have go to the harbour .
I have come here often , ever since I have live with you . ''
`` Ever since you have live with me you have be deceive me like this , Felix ? ''
There be no anger in Mr. Leonard 's tone -- only measureless sorrow .
The boy 's sensitive lip quiver .
`` Forgive me , grandfather , '' he whisper beseechingly .
`` You never forbid him to come , '' old Abel break in angrily .
`` Be just , Mr. Leonard -- be just . ''
`` I AM just .
Felix know that he have disobey me , in the spirit if not in the letter .
Do you not know it , Felix ? ''
`` Yes , grandfather , I have do wrong -- I 've know that I be do wrong every time I come .
Forgive me , grandfather . ''
`` Felix , I forgive you , but I ask you to promise me , here and now , that you will never again , as long a you live , touch a violin . ''
Dusky crimson rush madly over the boy 's face .
He give a cry a if he have be lash with a whip .
Old Abel sprang to his foot .
`` Do n't you ask such a promise of him , Mr. Leonard , '' he cry furiously .
`` It 's a sin , that 's what it be .
Man , man , what blind you ?
You ARE blind .
Ca n't you see what be in the boy ?
His soul be full of music .
It 'll torture him to death -- or to worse -- if you do n't let it have way . ''
`` There be a devil in such music , '' say Mr. Leonard hotly .
`` Ay , there may be , but do n't forget that there 's a Christ in it , too , '' retort old Abel in a low tense tone .
Mr. Leonard look shocked ; he consider that old Abel have utter blasphemy .
He turn away from him rebukingly .
`` Felix , promise me . ''
There be no relenting in his face or tone .
He be merciless in the use of the power he possess over that young , loving spirit .
Felix understand that there be no escape ; but his lip be very white a he say , `` I promise , grandfather . ''
Mr. Leonard draw a long breath of relief .
He know that promise would be keep .
So do old Abel .
The latter cross the floor and sullenly take the violin from Felix 's relaxed hand .
Without a word or look he go into the little bedroom off the kitchen and shut the door with a slam of righteous indignation .
But from it window he stealthily watch his visitor go away .
Just a they enter on the maple path Mr. Leonard lay his hand on Felix 's head and look down at him .
Instantly the boy fling his arm up over the old man 's shoulder and smile at him .
In the look they exchange there be boundless love and trust -- ay , and good-fellowship .
Old Abel 's scornful eye again hold the golden flash .
`` How those two love each other ! ''
he mutter enviously .
`` And how they torture each other ! ''
Mr. Leonard go to his study to pray when he get home .
He know that Felix have run for comfort to Janet Andrews , the little , thin , sweet-faced , rigid-lipped woman who keep house for them .
Mr. Leonard know that Janet would disapprove of his action as deeply a old Abel have do .
She would say nothing , she would only look at him with reproachful eye over the teacup at suppertime .
But Mr. Leonard believe he have do what be best and his conscience do not trouble him , though his heart do .
Thirteen year before this , his daughter Margaret have almost break that heart by marry a man of whom he could not approve .
Martin Moore be a professional violinist .
He be a popular performer , though not in any sense a great one .
He meet the slim , golden-haired daughter of the manse at the house of a college friend she be visit in Toronto , and fell straightway in love with her .
Margaret have love him with all her virginal heart in return , and marry him , despite her father 's disapproval .
It be not to Martin Moore 's profession that Mr. Leonard object , but to the man himself .
He know that the violinist 's past life have not be such a become a suitor for Margaret Leonard ; and his insight into character warn him that Martin Moore could never make any woman lastingly happy .
Margaret Leonard do not believe this .
She marry Martin Moore and live one year in paradise .
Perhaps that atone for the three bitter year which follow -- that , and her child .
At all event , she die a she have live , loyal and uncomplaining .
She die alone , for her husband be away on a concert tour , and her illness be so brief that her father have not time to reach her before the end .
Her body be take home to be bury beside her mother in the little Carmody churchyard .
Mr. Leonard wish to take the child , but Martin Moore refuse to give him up .
Six year later Moore , too , die , and at last Mr. Leonard have his heart 's desire -- the possession of Margaret 's son .
The grandfather await the child 's come with mingled feeling .
His heart yearn for him , yet he dread to meet a second edition of Martin Moore .
Suppose Margaret 's son resemble his handsome vagabond of a father !
Or , bad still , suppose he be curse with his father 's lack of principle , his instability , his Bohemian instinct .
Thus Mr. Leonard torture himself wretchedly before the come of Felix .
The child do not look like either father or mother .
Instead , Mr. Leonard find himself look into a face which he have put away under the grass thirty year before -- the face of his girl bride , who have die at Margaret 's birth .
Here again be her lustrous gray-black eye , her ivory outline , her fine-traced arch of brow ; and here , look out of those eye , seem her very spirit again .
From that moment the soul of the old man be knit to the soul of the child , and they love each other with a love surpass that of woman .
Felix 's only inheritance from his father be his love of music .
But the child have genius , where his father have possess only talent .
To Martin Moore 's outward mastery of the violin be add the mystery and intensity of his mother 's nature , with some more subtle quality still , which have perhaps come to him from the grandmother he so strongly resemble .
Moore have understand what a career be naturally before the child , and he have train him in the technique of his art from the time the slight finger could first grasp the bow .
When nine-year-old Felix come to the Carmody manse , he have master a much of the science of the violin a nine out of ten musician acquire in a lifetime ; and he bring with him his father 's violin ; it be all Martin Moore have to leave his son -- but it be an Amati , the commercial value of which nobody in Carmody suspect .
Mr. Leonard have take possession of it and Felix have never see it since .
He cry himself to sleep many a night for the loss of it .
Mr. Leonard do not know this , and if Janet Andrews suspect it she hold her tongue -- an art in which she excel .
She `` saw no harm in a fiddle , '' herself , and think Mr. Leonard absurdly strict in the matter , though it would not have be well for the luckless outsider who might have venture to say as much to her .
She have connive at Felix 's visit to old Abel Blair , square the matter with her Presbyterian conscience by some peculiar process know only to herself .
When Janet heard of the promise which Mr. Leonard have exact from Felix she seethe with indignation ; and , though she `` know her place '' good than to say anything to Mr. Leonard about it , she make her disapproval so plainly manifest in her bearing that the stern , gentle old man find the atmosphere of his hitherto peaceful manse unpleasantly chill and hostile for a time .
It be the wish of his heart that Felix should be a minister , a he would have wish his own son to be , have one be bear to him .
Mr. Leonard think rightly that the high work to which any man could be call be a life of service to his fellow ; but he make the mistake of suppose the field of service much narrow than it be -- of fail to see that a man may minister to the need of humanity in many different but equally effective way .
Janet hop that Mr. Leonard might not exact the fulfilment of Felix 's promise ; but Felix himself , with the instinctive understanding of perfect love , know that it be vain to hope for any change of viewpoint in his grandfather .
He address himself to the keep of his promise in letter and in spirit .
He never go again to old Abel 's ; he do not even play on the organ , though this be not forbidden , because any music waken in him a passion of longing and ecstasy which demand expression with an intensity not to be borne .
He fling himself grimly into his study and con Latin and Greek verb with a persistency which soon place him at the head of all competitor .
Only once in the long winter do he come near to break his promise .
One evening , when March be melt into April , and the pulse of spring be stir under the lingering snow , he be walk home from school alone .
As he descend into the little hollow below the manse a lively lilt of music drift up to meet him .
It be only the product of a mouth-organ , manipulate by a little black-eyed , French-Canadian hire boy , sit on the fence by the brook ; but there be music in the ragged urchin and it come out through his simple toy .
It tingle over Felix from head to foot ; and , when Leon hold out the mouth-organ with a fraternal grin of invitation , he snatch at it a a famished creature might snatch at food .
Then , with it half-way to his lip , he pause .
True , it be only the violin he have promise never to touch ; but he felt that if he give way ever so little to the desire that be in him , it would sweep everything before it .
If he play on Leon Buote 's mouth-organ , there in that misty spring dale , he would go to old Abel 's that evening ; he KNEW he would go .
To Leon 's amazement , Felix throw the mouth-organ back at him and run up the hill a if he be pursue .
There be something in his boyish face that frighten Leon ; and it frighten Janet Andrews a Felix rush past her in the hall of the manse .
`` Child , what 's the matter with you ? ''
she cry .
`` Are you sick ?
Have you be scar ? ''
`` No , no .
Leave me alone , Janet , '' say Felix chokingly , dash up the stair to his own room .
He be quite composed when he come down to tea , an hour later , though he be unusually pale and have purple shadow under his large eye .
Mr. Leonard scrutinize him somewhat anxiously ; it suddenly occur to the old minister that Felix be look more delicate than his wont this spring .
Well , he have study hard all winter , and he be certainly grow very fast .
When vacation come he must be send away for a visit .
`` They tell me Naomi Clark be real sick , '' say Janet .
`` She have be ail all winter , and now she 's fast to her bed .
Mrs. Murphy say she believe the woman be die , but nobody dare tell her so .
She wo n't give in she 's sick , nor take medicine .
And there 's nobody to wait on her except that simple creature , Maggie Peterson . ''
`` I wonder if I ought to go and see her , '' say Mr. Leonard uneasily .
`` What use would it be to bother yourself ?
You know she would n't see you -- she 'd shut the door in your face like she do before .
She 's an awful wicked woman -- but it 's kind of terrible to think of her lie there sick , with no responsible person to tend her . ''
`` Naomi Clark be a bad woman and she live a life of shame , but I like her , for all that , '' remark Felix , in the grave , meditative tone in which he occasionally say rather startling thing .
Mr. Leonard look somewhat reproachfully at Janet Andrews , a if to ask her why Felix should have attain to this dubious knowledge of good and evil under her care ; and Janet shoot a dour look back which , be interpret , mean that if Felix go to the district school she could not and would not be hold responsible if he learn more there than arithmetic and Latin .
`` What do you know of Naomi Clark to like or dislike ? ''
she ask curiously .
`` Did you ever see her ? ''
`` Oh , yes , '' Felix reply , address himself to his cherry preserve with considerable gusto .
`` I be down at Spruce Cove one night last summer when a big thunderstorm come up .
I go to Naomi 's house for shelter .
The door be open , so I walk right in , because nobody answer my knock .
Naomi Clark be at the window , watch the cloud come up over the sea .
She just look at me once , but do n't say anything , and then go on watch the cloud .
I do n't like to sit down because she have n't ask me to , so I go to the window by her and watch it , too .
It be a dreadful sight -- the cloud be so black and the water so green , and there be such a strange light between the cloud and the water ; yet there be something splendid in it , too .
Part of the time I watch the storm , and the other part I watch Naomi 's face .
It be dreadful to see , like the storm , and yet I like to see it .
`` After the thunder be over it rain a while longer , and Naomi sit down and talk to me .
She ask me who I be , and when I tell her she ask me to play something for her on her violin , '' -- Felix shoot a deprecating glance at Mr. Leonard -- `` because , she say , she 'd hear I be a great hand at it .
She want something lively , and I try just as hard a I could to play something like that .
But I could n't .
I play something that be terrible -- it just play itself -- it seem a if something be lose that could never be find again .
And before I get through , Naomi come at me , and tear the violin from me , and -- SWORE .
And she say , ` You big-eyed brat , how do you know THAT ? '
Then she take me by the arm -- and she hurt me , too , I can tell you -- and she put me right out in the rain and slam the door . ''
`` The rude , unmannerly creature ! ''
say Janet indignantly .
`` Oh , no , she be quite in the right , '' say Felix composedly .
`` It serve me right for what I play .
You see , she do n't know I could n't help play it .
I suppose she think I do it on purpose . ''
`` What on earth do you play , child ? ''
`` I do n't know . ''
Felix shiver .
`` It be awful -- it be dreadful .
It be fit to break you heart .
But it HAD to be play , if I play anything at all . ''
`` I do n't understand what you mean -- I declare I do n't , '' say Janet in bewilderment .
`` I think we 'll change the subject of conversation , '' say Mr. Leonard .
It be a month later when `` the simple creature , Maggie '' appear at the manse door one evening and ask for the preached .
`` Naomi want ter see yer , '' she mumble .
`` Naomi send Maggie ter tell yer ter come at onct . ''
`` I shall go , certainly , '' say Mr. Leonard gently .
`` Is she very ill ? ''
`` Her 's dying , '' say Maggie with a broad grin .
`` And her 's awful skeered of hell .
Her just know ter-day her be die .
Maggie tell her -- her would n't believe the harbour woman , but her believed Maggie .
Her yelled awful . ''
Maggie chuckle to herself over the gruesome remembrance .
Mr. Leonard , his heart fill with pity , call Janet and tell her to give the poor creature some refreshment .
But Maggie shake her head .
`` No , no , preacher , Maggie must get right back to Naomi .
Maggie 'll tell her the preacher 's coming ter save her from hell . ''
She utter an eerie cry , and run at full speed shoreward through the spruce wood .
`` The Lord save u ! ''
say Janet in an awed tone .
`` I know the poor girl be simple , but I do n't know she be like THAT .
And be you go , sir ? ''
`` Yes , of course .
I pray God I may be able to help the poor soul , '' say Mr. Leonard sincerely .
He be a man who never shirk what he believe to be his duty ; but duty have sometimes present itself to him in pleasanter guise than this summons to Naomi Clark 's death-bed .
The woman have be the plague spot of Lower Carmody and Carmody Harbour for a generation .
In the early day of his ministry to the congregation he have try to reclaim her , and Naomi have mock and flout him to his face .
Then , for the sake of those to whom she be a snare or a heart-break , he have endeavour to set the law in motion against her , and Naomi have laugh the law to scorn .
Finally , he have be compel to let her alone .
Yet Naomi have not always be an outcast .
Her girlhood have be innocent ; but she be the possessor of a dangerous beauty , and her mother be dead .
Her father be a man notorious for his harshness and violence of temper .
When Naomi make the fatal mistake of trust to a false love that betray and desert , he drive her from his door with taunt and curse .
Naomi take up her quarter in a little deserted house at Spruce Cove .
Had her child live it might have save her .
But it die at birth , and with it little life go her last chance of worldly redemption .
From that time forth , her foot be set in the way that take hold on hell .
For the past five year , however , Naomi have live a tolerably respectable life .
When Janet Peterson have die , her idiot daughter , Maggie , have be leave with no kin in the world .
Nobody know what be to be do with her , for nobody want to be bother with her .
Naomi Clark go to the girl and offer her a home .
People say she be no fit person to have charge of Maggie , but everybody shirk the unpleasant task of interfere in the matter , except Mr. Leonard , who go to expostulate with Naomi , and , a Janet say , for his pain get her door shut in his face .
But from the day when Maggie Peterson go to live with her , Naomi cease to be the harbour Magdalen .
The sun have set when Mr. Leonard reach Spruce Cove , and the harbour be veil itself in a wondrous twilight splendour .
Afar out , the sea lay throb and purple , and the moan of the bar come through the sweet , chill spring air with it burden of hopeless , endless longing and seek .
The sky be blossom into star above the afterglow ; out to the east the moon be rise , and the sea beneath it be a thing of radiance and silver and glamour ; and a little harbour boat that go sail across it be transmute into an elfin shallop from the coast of fairyland .
Mr. Leonard sigh a he turn from the sinless beauty of the sea and sky to the threshold of Naomi Clark 's house .
It be very small -- one room below , and a sleeping-loft above ; but a bed have be make up for the sick woman by the down-stairs window look out on the harbour ; and Naomi lay on it , with a lamp burning at her head and another at her side , although it be not yet dark .
A great dread of darkness have always be one of Naomi 's peculiarity .
She be toss restlessly on her poor couch , while Maggie crouch on a box at the foot .
Mr. Leonard have not see her for five year , and he be shock at the change in her .
She be much waste ; her clear-cut , aquiline feature have be of the type which become indescribably witch-like in old age , and , though Naomi Clark be barely sixty , she look a if she might be a hundred .
Her hair stream over the pillow in white , uncared-for tress , and the hand that pluck at the bed-clothes be like wrinkle claw .
Only her eye be unchanged ; they be a blue and brilliant a ever , but now fill with such agonized terror and appeal that Mr. Leonard 's gentle heart almost stand still with the horror of them .
They be the eye of a creature drive wild with torture , hound by fury , clutch by unutterable fear .
Naomi sit up and drag at his arm .
`` Can you help me ?
Can you help me ? ''
she gasp imploringly .
`` Oh , I think you 'd never come !
I be skeered I 'd die before you get here -- die and go to hell .
I do n't know before today that I be die .
None of those coward would tell me .
Can you help me ? ''
`` If I can not , God can , '' say Mr. Leonard gently .
He felt himself very helpless and inefficient before this awful terror and frenzy .
He have see sad death-beds -- trouble death-beds -- ay , and despair death-beds , but never anything like this .
`` God ! ''
Naomi 's voice shrill terribly a she utter the name .
`` I ca n't go to God for help .
Oh , I 'm skeered of hell , but I 'm skeereder still of God .
I 'd rather go to hell a thousand time over than face God after the life I 've live .
I tell you , I 'm sorry for living wicked -- I be always sorry for it all the time .
There ai n't never be a moment I be n't sorry , though nobody would believe it .
I be drive on by fiend of hell .
Oh , you do n't understand -- you CA N'T understand -- but I be always sorry ! ''
`` If you repent , that be all that be necessary .
God will forgive you if you ask Him . ''
`` No , He ca n't !
Sins like mine ca n't be forgive .
He ca n't -- and He wo n't . ''
`` He can and He will .
He be a God of love , Naomi . ''
`` No , '' say Naomi with stubborn conviction .
`` He be n't a God of love at all .
That 's why I 'm skeered of him .
No , no .
He 's a God of wrath and justice and punishment .
Love !
There ai n't no such thing a love !
I 've never find it on earth , and I do n't believe it 's to be find in God . ''
`` Naomi , God love u like a father . ''
`` Like MY father ? ''
Naomi 's shrill laughter , peal through the still room , be hideous to hear .
The old minister shudder .
`` No -- no !
As a kind , tender , all-wise father , Naomi -- a you would have love your little child if it have live . ''
Naomi cower and moan .
`` Oh , I wish I could believe THAT .
I would n't be frighten if I could believe that .
MAKE me believe it .
Surely you can make me believe that there 's love and forgiveness in God if you believe it yourself . ''
`` Jesus Christ forgave and love the Magdalen , Naomi . ''
`` Jesus Christ ?
Oh , I ai n't afraid of HIM .
Yes , HE could understand and forgive .
He be half human .
I tell you , it 's God I 'm skeered of . ''
`` They be one and the same , '' say Mr. Leonard helplessly .
He know he could not make Naomi realize it .
This anguish death-bed be no place for a theological exposition on the mystery of the Trinity .
`` Christ die for you , Naomi .
He bore your sin in His own body on the cross . ''
`` We bear our own sin , '' say Naomi fiercely .
`` I 've bear mine all my life -- and I 'll bear them for all eternity .
I ca n't believe anything else .
I CA N'T believe God can forgive me .
I 've ruin people body and soul -- I 've break heart and poison home -- I 'm bad than a murderess .
No -- no -- no , there 's no hope for me . ''
Her voice rise again into that shrill , intolerable shriek .
`` I 've get to go to hell .
It ai n't so much the fire I 'm skeered of a the outer darkness .
I 've always be so skeered of darkness -- it 's so full of awful thing and thought .
Oh , there ai n't nobody to help me !
Man ai n't no good and I 'm too skeered of God . ''
She wring her hand .
Mr. Leonard walk up and down the room in the keen anguish of spirit he have ever know .
What could he do ?
What could he say ?
There be heal and peace in his religion for this woman a for all others , but he could express it in no language which this torture soul could understand .
He look at her writhe face ; he look at the idiot girl chuckle to herself at the foot of the bed ; he look through the open door to the remote , starlit night -- and a horrible sense of utter helplessness overcame him .
He could do nothing -- nothing !
In all his life he have never know such bitterness of soul a the realization bring home to him .
`` What be the good of you if you ca n't help me ? ''
moan the die woman .
`` Pray -- pray -- pray ! ''
she shrill suddenly .
Mr. Leonard drop on his knee by the bed .
He do not know what to say .
No prayer that he have ever pray be of use here .
The old , beautiful formula , which have soothe and help the passing of many a soul , be naught save idle , empty word to Naomi Clark .
In his anguish of mind Stephen Leonard gasp out the briefest and sincere prayer his lip have ever utter .
`` O , God , our Father !
Help this woman .
Speak to her in a tongue which she can understand . ''
A beautiful , white face appear for a moment in the light that stream out of the doorway into the darkness of the night .
No one notice it , and it quickly draw back into the shadow .
Suddenly , Naomi fell back on her pillow , her lip blue , her face horribly pinch , her eye roll up in her head .
Maggie start up , push Mr. Leonard aside , and proceed to administer some remedy with surprising skill and deftness .
Mr. Leonard , believe Naomi to be die , go to the door , feel sick and bruise in soul .
Presently a figure stole out into the light .
`` Felix , be that you ? ''
say Mr. Leonard in a startled tone .
`` Yes , sir . ''
Felix come up to the stone step .
`` Janet get frighten what you might fall on that rough road after dark , so she make me come after you with a lantern .
I 've be wait behind the point , but at last I think I 'd better come and see if you would be stay much long .
If you will be , I 'll go back to Janet and leave the lantern here with you . ''
`` Yes , that will be the best thing to do .
I may not be ready to go home for some time yet , '' say Mr. Leonard , think that the death-bed of sin behind him be no sight for Felix 's young eye .
`` Is that your grandson you 're talk to ? ''
Naomi speak clearly and strongly .
The spasm have pass .
`` If it be , bring him in .
I want to see him . ''
Reluctantly , Mr. Leonard sign Felix to enter .
The boy stood by Naomi 's bed and look down at her with sympathetic eye .
But at first she do not look at him -- she look past him at the minister .
`` I might have die in that spell , '' she say , with sullen reproach in her voice , `` and if I have , I 'd be in hell now .
You ca n't help me -- I 'm do with you .
There ai n't any hope for me , and I know it now . ''
She turn to Felix .
`` Take down that fiddle on the wall and play something for me , '' she say imperiously .
`` I 'm die -- and I 'm go to hell -- and I do n't want to think of it .
Play me something to take my thought off it -- I do n't care what you play .
I be always fond of music -- there be always something in it for me I never find anywhere else . ''
Felix look at his grandfather .
The old man nod , he felt too ashamed to speak ; he sit with his fine silver head in his hand , while Felix take down and tune the old violin , on which so many godless lilt have be play in many a wild revel .
Mr. Leonard felt that he have fail his religion .
He could not give Naomi the help that be in it for her .
Felix draw the bow softly , perplexedly over the string .
He have no idea what he should play .
Then his eye be catch and hold by Naomi 's burning , mesmeric , blue gaze a she lay on her crumple pillow .
A strange , inspired look come over the boy 's face .
He begin to play a if it be not he who play , but some mighty power , of which he be but the passive instrument .
Sweet and soft and wonderful be the music that steal through the room .
Mr. Leonard forget his heartbreak and listen to it in puzzled amazement .
He have never hear anything like it before .
How could the child play like that ?
He look at Naomi and marvel at the change in her face .
The fear and frenzy be go out of it ; she listen breathlessly , never take her eye from Felix .
At the foot of the bed the idiot girl sit with tear on her cheek .
In that strange music be the joy of the innocent , mirthful childhood , blent with the laughter of wave and the call of glad wind .
Then it hold the wild , wayward dream of youth , sweet and pure in all their wildness and waywardness .
They be follow by a rapture of young love -- all-surrendering , all-sacrificing love .
The music change .
It hold the torture of unshed tear , the anguish of a heart deceive and desolate .
Mr. Leonard almost put his hand over his ear to shut out it intolerable poignancy .
But on the die woman 's face be only a strange relief , a if some dumb , long-hidden pain have at last won to the healing of utterance .
The sullen indifference of despair come next , the bitterness of smoulder revolt and misery , the reckless cast away of all good .
There be something indescribably evil in the music now -- so evil that Mr. Leonard 's white soul shudder away in loathing , and Maggie cower and whine like a frightened animal .
Again the music change .
And in it now there be agony and fear -- and repentance and a cry for pardon .
To Mr. Leonard there be something strangely familiar in it .
He struggle to recall where he have hear it before ; then he suddenly know -- he have hear it before Felix come in Naomi 's terrible word !
He look at his grandson with something like awe .
Here be a power of which he know nothing -- a strange and dreadful power .
Was it of God ?
Or of Satan ?
For the last time the music change .
And now it be not music at all -- it be a great , infinite forgiveness , an all-comprehending love .
It be heal for a sick soul ; it be light and hope and peace .
A Bible text , seemingly incongruous , come into Mr. Leonard 's mind -- `` This be the house of God ; this be the gate of heaven . ''
Felix lower the violin and drop wearily on a chair by the bed .
The inspired light fade from his face ; once more he be only a tired boy .
But Stephen Leonard be on his knee , sob like a child ; and Naomi Clark be lie still , with her hand clasp over her breast .
`` I understand now , '' she say very softly .
`` I could n't see it before -- and now it 's so plain .
I just FEEL it .
God IS a God of love .
He can forgive anybody -- even me -- even me .
He know all about it .
I ai n't skeered any more .
He just love me and forgive me a I 'd have love and forgive my baby if she 'd live , no matter how bad she be , or what she do .
The minister tell me that but I could n't believe it .
I KNOW it now .
And He send you here to-night , boy , to tell it to me in a way that I could feel it . ''
Naomi Clark die just a the dawn come up over the sea .
Mr. Leonard rise from his watch at her bedside and go to the door .
Before him spread the harbour , gray and austere in the faint light , but afar out the sun be rend asunder the milk-white mist in which the sea be scarf , and under it be a virgin glow of sparkling water .
The fir tree on the point move softly and whisper together .
The whole world sang of spring and resurrection and life ; and behind him Naomi Clark 's dead face take on the peace that pass understanding .
The old minister and his grandson walk home together in a silence that neither wish to break .
Janet Andrews give them a good scolding and an excellent breakfast .
Then she order them both to bed ; but Mr. Leonard , smile at her , say : `` Presently , Janet , presently .
But now , take this key , go up to the black chest in the garret , and bring me what you will find there . ''
When Janet have go , he turn to Felix .
`` Felix , would you like to study music a your life-work ? ''
Felix look up , with a transfigure flush on his wan face .
`` Oh , grandfather !
Oh , grandfather ! ''
`` You may do so , my child .
After this night I dare not hinder you .
Go with my blessing , and may God guide and keep you , and make you strong to do His work and tell His message to humanity in you own appointed way .
It be not the way I desire for you -- but I see that I be mistake .
Old Abel speak truly when he say there be a Christ in your violin as well a a devil .
I understand what he mean now . ''
He turn to meet Janet , who come into the study with a violin .
Felix 's heart throb ; he recognize it .
Mr. Leonard take it from Janet and hold it out to the boy .
`` This be your father 's violin , Felix .
See to it that you never make your music the servant of the power of evil -- never debase it to unworthy end .
For your responsibility be a your gift , and God will exact the accounting of it from you .
Speak to the world in your own tongue through it , with truth and sincerity ; and all I have hop for you will be abundantly fulfil . ''
IV .
Little Joscelyn `` It simply be n't to be think of , Aunty Nan , '' say Mrs. William Morrison decisively .
Mrs. William Morrison be one of those people who always speak decisively .
If they merely announce that they be go to peel the potato for dinner their hearer realize that there be no possible escape for the potato .
Moreover , these people be always give their full title by everybody .
William Morrison be call Billy oftener than not ; but , if you have ask for Mrs. Billy Morrison , nobody in Avonlea would have know what you mean at first guess .
`` You must see that for yourself , Aunty , '' go on Mrs. William , hull strawberry nimbly with her large , firm , white finger a she talk .
Mrs. William always improve every shin moment .
`` It be ten mile to Kensington , and just think how late you would be get back .
You be not able for such a drive .
You would n't get over it for a month .
You know you be anything but strong this summer . ''
Aunty Nan sigh , and pat the tiny , furry , gray morsel of a kitten in her lap with tremble finger .
She know , good than anyone else could know it , that she be not strong that summer .
In her secret soul , Aunty Nan , sweet and frail and timid under the burden of her seventy year , felt with mysterious unmistakable prescience that it be to be her last summer at the Gull Point Farm .
But that be only the more reason why she should go to hear little Joscelyn sing ; she would never have another chance .
And oh , to hear little Joscelyn sing just once -- Joscelyn , whose voice be delight thousand out in the big world , just a in the year go by it have delight Aunty Nan and the dweller at the Gull Point Farm for a whole golden summer with carol at dawn and dusk about the old place !
`` Oh , I know I 'm not very strong , Maria . ''
say Aunty Nan pleadingly , `` but I be strong enough for that .
Indeed I be .
I could stay at Kensington over night with George 's folk , you know , and so it would n't tire me much .
I do so want to hear Joscelyn sing .
Oh , how I love little Joscelyn . ''
`` It pass my understanding , the way you hanker after that child , '' cry Mrs. William impatiently .
`` Why , she be a perfect stranger to you when she come here , and she be here only one summer ! ''
`` But oh , such a summer ! ''
say Aunty Nan softly .
`` We all love little Joscelyn .
She just seem like one of our own .
She be one of God 's child , carry love with them everywhere .
In some way that little Anne Shirley the Cuthberts have get up there at Green Gables remind me of her , though in other way they 're not a bit alike .
Joscelyn be a beauty . ''
`` Well , that Shirley snippet certainly be n't that , '' say Mrs. William sarcastically .
`` And if Joscelyn 's tongue be one third as long a Anne Shirley 's the wonder to me be that she do n't talk you all to death out of hand . ''
`` Little Joscelyn be n't much of a talker , '' say Aunty Nan dreamily .
`` She be kind of a quiet child .
But you remember what she do say .
And I 've never forget little Joscelyn . ''
Mrs. William shrug her plump , shapely shoulder .
`` Well , it be fifteen year ago , Aunty Nan , and Joscelyn ca n't be very ` little ' now .
She be a famous woman , and she have forget all about you , you can be sure of that . ''
`` Joscelyn be n't the kind that forget , '' say Aunty Nan loyally .
`` And , anyway , the point be , I have n't forget HER .
Oh , Maria , I 've long for year and year just to hear her sing once more .
It seem a if I MUST hear my little Joscelyn sing once again before I die .
I 've never have the chance before and I never will have it again .
Do please ask William to take me to Kensington . ''
`` Dear me , Aunty Nan , this be really childish , '' say Mrs. William , whisk her bowlful of berry into the pantry .
`` You must let other folk be the judge of what be best for you now .
You be n't strong enough to drive to Kensington , and , even if you be , you know well enough that William could n't go to Kensington to-morrow night .
He have get to attend that political meeting at Newbridge .
They ca n't do without him . ''
`` Jordan could take me to Kensington , '' plead Aunty Nan , with very unusual persistence .
`` Nonsense !
You could n't go to Kensington with the hired man .
Now , Aunty Nan , do be reasonable .
Are n't William and I kind to you ?
Do n't we do everything for your comfort ? ''
`` Yes , oh , yes , '' admit Aunty Nan deprecatingly .
`` Well , then , you ought to be guide by our opinion .
And you must just give up think about the Kensington concert , Aunty , and not worry yourself and me about it any more .
I be go down to the shore field now to call William to tea .
Just keep an eye on the baby in chance he wake up , and see that the teapot do n't boil over . ''
Mrs. William whisk out of the kitchen , pretend not to see the tear that be fall over Aunty Nan 's withered pink cheek .
Aunty Nan be really get very childish , Mrs. William reflect , a she march down to the shore field .
Why , she cry now about every little thing !
And such a notion -- to want to go to the Old Timers ' concert at Kensington and be so set on it !
Really , it be hard to put up with her whim .
Mrs. William sigh virtuously .
As for Aunty Nan , she sit alone in the kitchen , and cry bitterly , a only lonely old age can cry .
It seem to her that she could not bear it , that she MUST go to Kensington .
But she know that it be not to be , since Mrs. William have decide otherwise .
Mrs. William 's word be law at Gull Point Farm .
`` What 's the matter with my old Aunty Nan ? ''
cry a hearty young voice from the doorway .
Jordan Sloane stand there , his round , freckle face look a anxious and sympathetic a it be possible for such a very round , very freckled face to look .
Jordan be the Morrisons ' hire boy that summer , and he worship Aunty Nan .
`` Oh , Jordan , '' sob Aunty Nan , who be not above tell her trouble to the hire help , although Mrs. William think she ought to be , `` I ca n't go to Kensington to-morrow night to hear little Joscelyn sing at the Old Timers ' concert .
Maria say I ca n't . ''
`` That 's too bad , '' say Jordan .
`` Old cat , '' he mutter after the retreating and serenely unconscious Mrs. William .
Then he shamble in and sit down on the sofa beside Aunty Nan .
`` There , there , do n't cry , '' he say , pat her thin little shoulder with his big , sunburn paw .
`` You 'll make yourself sick if you go on cry , and we ca n't get along without you at Gull Point Farm . ''
Aunty Nan smile wanly .
`` I 'm afraid you 'll soon have to get on without me , Jordan .
I 'm not go to be here very long now .
No , I 'm not , Jordan , I know it .
Something tell me so very plainly .
But I would be willing to go -- glad to go , for I 'm very tired , Jordan -- if I could only have hear little Joscelyn sing once more . ''
`` Why be you so set on hear her ? ''
ask Jordan .
`` She ai n't no kin to you , be she ? ''
`` No , but dearer to me -- dearer to me than many of my own .
Maria think that be silly , but you would n't if you 'd know her , Jordan .
Even Maria herself would n't , if she have know her .
It be fifteen year since she come here one summer to board .
She be a child of thirteen then , and have n't any relation except an old uncle who send her to school in winter and board her out in summer , and do n't care a rap about her .
The child be just starve for love , Jordan , and she get it here .
William and his brother be just child then , and they have n't any sister .
We all just worship her .
She be so sweet , Jordan .
And pretty , oh my !
like a little girl in a picture , with great long curl , all black and purply and fine a spun silk , and big dark eye , and such pink cheek -- real wild rise cheek .
And sing !
My land !
But could n't she sing !
Always sing , every hour of the day that voice be ring round the old place .
I use to hold my breath to hear it .
She always say that she mean to be a famous singer some day , and I never doubt it a mite .
It be bear in her .
Sunday evening she use to sing hymn for u .
Oh , Jordan , it make my old heart young again to remember it .
A sweet child she be , my little Joscelyn !
She use to write me for three or four year after she go away , but I have n't hear a word from her for long and long .
I daresay she have forget me , a Maria say .
` Twould n't be any wonder .
But I have n't forget her , and oh , I want to see and hear her terrible much .
She be to sing at the Old Timers ' concert to-morrow night at Kensington .
The folk who be get the concert up be friend of hers , or , of course , she 'd never have come to a little country village .
Only sixteen mile away -- and I ca n't go . ''
Jordan could n't think of anything to say .
He reflect savagely that if he have a horse of his own he would take Aunty Nan to Kensington , Mrs. William or no Mrs. William .
Though , to be sure , it WAS a long drive for her ; and she be look very frail this summer .
`` Ai n't go to last long , '' mutter Jordan , make his escape by the porch door a Mrs. William puffed in by the other .
`` The sweet old creetur that ever be create 'll go when she go .
Yah , ye old madam , I 'd like to give you a piece of my mind , that I would ! ''
This last be for Mrs. William , but be deliver in a prudent undertone .
Jordan detest Mrs. William , but she be a power to be reckon with , all the same .
Meek , easy-going Billy Morrison do just what his wife tell him to .
So Aunty Nan do not get to Kensington to hear little Joscelyn sing .
She say nothing more about it but after that night she seem to fail very rapidly .
Mrs. William say it be the hot weather , and that Aunty Nan give way too easily .
But Aunty Nan could not help give way now ; she be very , very tired .
Even her knitting weary her .
She would sit for hour in her rock chair with the gray kitten in her lap , look out of the window with dreamy , unseeing eye .
She talk to herself a good deal , generally about little Joscelyn .
Mrs. William tell Avonlea folk that Aunty Nan have get terribly childish and always accompany the remark with a sigh that intimate how much she , Mrs. William , have to contend with .
Justice must be do to Mrs. William , however .
She be not unkind to Aunty Nan ; on the contrary , she be very kind to her in the letter .
Her comfort be scrupulously attend to , and Mrs. William have the grace to utter none of her complaint in the old woman 's hearing .
If Aunty Nan felt the absence of the spirit she never murmur at it .
One day , when the Avonlea slope be golden-hued with the ripened harvest , Aunty Nan do not get up .
She complain of nothing but great weariness .
Mrs. William remark to her husband that if SHE lay in bed every day she felt tired , there would n't be much do at Gull Point Farm .
But she prepare an excellent breakfast and carry it patiently up to Aunty Nan , who eat little of it .
After dinner Jordan creep up by way of the back stair to see her .
Aunty Nan be lie with her eye fix on the pale pink climb rose that nod about the window .
When she saw Jordan she smile .
`` Them roses put me so much in mind of little Joscelyn , '' she say softly .
`` She love them so .
If I could only see her !
Oh , Jordan , if I could only see her !
Maria say it 's terrible childish to be always harp on that string , and mebbe it be .
But -- oh , Jordan , there 's such a hunger in my heart for her , such a hunger ! ''
Jordan felt a queer sensation in his throat , and twist his ragged straw hat about in his big hand .
Just then a vague idea which have hover in his brain all day crystallize into decision .
But all he say be : `` I hope you 'll feel well soon , Aunty Nan . ''
`` Oh , yes , Jordan dear , I 'll be good soon , '' say Aunty Nan with her own sweet smile . ''
` The inhabitant shall not say I be sick , ' you know .
But if I could only see little Joscelyn first ! ''
Jordan go out and hurried down-stairs .
Billy Morrison be in the stable , when Jordan stick his head over the half-door .
`` Say , can I have the rest of the day off , sir ?
I want to go to Kensington . ''
`` Well , I do n't mind , '' say Billy Morrison amiably .
`` May 's well get you jaunt do ` fore harvest come on .
And here , Jord ; take this quarter and get some orange for Aunty Nan .
Need n't mention it to headquarters . ''
Billy Morrison 's face be solemn , but Jordan wink a he pocket the money .
`` If I 've any luck , I 'll bring her something that 'll do her more good than the orange , '' he mutter , a he hurry off to the pasture .
Jordan have a horse of his own now , a rather bony nag , answer to the name of Dan .
Billy Morrison have agree to pasture the animal if Jordan use him in the farm work , an arrangement scoffed at by Mrs. William in no measured term .
Jordan hitch Dan into the second best buggy , dress himself in his Sunday clothes , and drive off .
On the road he re-read a paragraph he have clip from the Charlottetown Daily Enterprise of the previous day .
`` Joscelyn Burnett , the famous contralto , be spend a few day in Kensington on her return from her Maritime concert tour .
She be the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Bromley , of The Beeches . ''
`` Now if I can get there in time , '' say Jordan emphatically .
Jordan get to Kensington , put Dan up in a livery stable , and inquire the way to The Beeches .
He felt rather nervous when he find it , it be such a stately , impose place , set back from the street in an emerald green seclusion of beautiful ground .
`` Fancy me stalk up to that front door and ask for Miss Joscelyn Burnett , '' grin Jordan sheepishly .
`` Mebbe they 'll tell me to go around to the back and inquire for the cook .
But you 're go just the same , Jordan Sloane , and no skulking .
March right up now .
Think of Aunty Nan and do n't let style down you . ''
A pert-looking maid answer Jordan 's ring , and star at him when he ask for Miss Burnett .
`` I do n't think you can see her , '' she say shortly , scan his country cut of hair and clothes rather superciliously .
`` What be your business with her ? ''
The maid 's scorn rouse Jordan 's `` dander , '' a he would have express it .
`` I 'll tell her that when I see her , '' he retort coolly .
`` Just you tell her that I 've a message for her from Aunty Nan Morrison of Gull Point Farm , Avonlea .
If she hai n't forget , that 'll fetch her .
You might as well hurry up , if you please , I 've not overly too much time . ''
The pert maid decide to be civil at least , and invite Jordan to enter .
But she leave him stand in the hall while she go in search of Miss Burnett .
Jordan gaze about him in amazement .
He have never be in any place like this before .
The hall be wonderful enough , and through the open door on either hand stretch vista of lovely room that , to Jordan 's eye , look like those of a palace .
`` Gee whiz !
How do they ever move around without knock thing over ? ''
Then Joscelyn Burnett come , and Jordan forget everything else .
This tall , beautiful woman , in her silken drapery , with a face like nothing Jordan have ever see , or even dream about , -- could this be Aunty Nan 's little Joscelyn ?
Jordan 's round , freckle countenance grow crimson .
He felt horribly tonguetied and embarrass .
What could he say to her ?
How could he say it ?
Joscelyn Burnett look at him with her large , dark eye , -- the eye of a woman who have suffer much , and learn much , and win through struggle to victory .
`` You have come from Aunty Nan ? ''
she say .
`` Oh , I be so glad to hear from her .
Is she well ?
Come in here and tell me all about her . ''
She turn toward one of those fairy-like room , but Jordan interrupt her desperately .
`` Oh , not in there , ma'am .
I 'd never get it out .
Just let me blunder through it out here someways .
Yes 'm , Aunty Nan , she ai n't very well .
She 's -- she 's die , I guess .
And she 's long for you night and day .
Seems a if she could n't die in peace without see you .
She want to get to Kensington to hear you sing , but that old cat of a Mrs. William -- beg you pardon , ma'am -- would n't let her come .
She 's always talk of you .
If you can come out to Gull Point Farm and see her , I 'll be most awful oblige to you , ma'am . ''
Joscelyn Burnett look troubled .
She have not forget Gull Point Farm , nor Aunty Nan ; but for year the memory have be dim , crowd into the background of consciousness by the more exciting event of her busy life .
Now it come back with a rush .
She recall it all tenderly -- the peace and beauty and love of that olden summer , and sweet Aunty Nan , so very wise in the lore of all thing simple and good and true .
For the moment Joscelyn Burnett be a lonely , hungry-hearted little girl again , seek for love and find it not , until Aunty Nan have take her into her great mother-heart and teach her it meaning .
`` Oh , I do n't know , '' she say perplexedly .
`` If you have come sooner -- I leave on the 11:30 train tonight .
I MUST leave by then or I shall not reach Montreal in time to fill a very important engagement .
And yet I must see Aunty Nan , too .
I have be careless and neglectful .
I might have go to see her before .
How can we manage it ? ''
`` I 'll bring you back to Kensington in time to catch that train , '' say Jordan eagerly .
`` There 's nothing I would n't do for Aunty Nan -- me and Dan .
Yes , sir , you 'll get back in time .
Just think of Aunty Nan 's face when she see you ! ''
`` I will come , '' say the great singer , gently .
It be sunset when they reach Gull Point Farm .
An arc of warm gold be over the spruce behind the house .
Mrs. William be out in the barn-yard , milking , and the house be desert , save for the sleep baby in the kitchen and the little old woman with the watchful eye in the up-stairs room .
`` This way , ma'am , '' say Jordan , inwardly congratulate himself that the coast be clear .
`` I 'll take you right up to her room . ''
Up-stairs , Joscelyn tap at the half-open door and go in .
Before it close behind her , Jordan hear Aunty Nan say , `` Joscelyn !
Little Joscelyn ! ''
in a tone that make him choke again .
He stumble thankfully down-stairs , to be pounce upon by Mrs. William in the kitchen .
`` Jordan Sloane , who be that stylish woman you drive into the yard with ?
And what have you do with her ? ''
`` That be Miss Joscelyn Burnett , '' say Jordan , expand himself .
This be his hour of triumph over Mrs. William .
`` I go to Kensington and brung her out to see Aunty Nan .
She 's up with her now . ''
`` Dear me , '' say Mrs. William helplessly .
`` And me in my milking rig !
Jordan , for pity 's sake , hold the baby while I go and put on my black silk .
You might have give a body some warning .
I declare I do n't know which be the great idiot , you or Aunty Nan ! ''
As Mrs. William flounce out of the kitchen , Jordan take his satisfaction in a quiet laugh .
Up-stairs in the little room be a great glory of sunset and gladness of human heart .
Joscelyn be kneel by the bed , with her arm about Aunty Nan ; and Aunty Nan , with her face all irradiate , be stroke Joscelyn 's dark hair fondly .
`` O , little Joscelyn , '' she murmur , `` it seem too good to be true .
It seem like a beautiful dream .
I know you the minute you open the door , my dearie .
You have n't change a bit .
And you 're a famous singer now , little Joscelyn !
I always know you would be .
Oh , I want you to sing a piece for me -- just one , wo n't you , dearie ?
Sing that piece people like to hear you sing best .
I forget the name , but I 've read about it in the paper .
Sing it for me , little Joscelyn . ''
And Joscelyn , stand by Aunty Nan 's bed , in the sunset light , sing the song she have sing to many a brilliant audience on many a noted concert-platform -- sing it a even she have never sing before , while Aunty Nan lay and listen beatifically , and downstairs even Mrs. William hold her breath , entrance by the exquisite melody that float through the old farmhouse .
`` O , little Joscelyn ! ''
breathe Aunty Nan in rapture , when the song end .
Joscelyn knelt by her again and they have a long talk of old day .
One by one they recall the memory of that vanished summer .
The past give up it tear and it laughter .
Heart and fancy alike go roam through the way of the long ago .
Aunty Nan be perfectly happy .
And then Joscelyn tell her all the story of her struggle and triumph since they have part .
When the moonlight begin to creep in through the low window , Aunty Nan put out her hand and touch Joscelyn 's bow head .
`` Little Joscelyn , '' she whisper , `` if it ai n't ask too much , I want you to sing just one other piece .
Do you remember when you be here how we sing hymn in the parlour every Sunday night , and my favourite always be ` The Sands of Time be Sinking ? '
I ai n't never forget how you use to sing that , and I want to hear it just once again , dearie .
Sing it for me , little Joscelyn . ''
Joscelyn rise and go to the window .
Lifting back the curtain , she stand in the splendour of the moonlight , and sing the grand old hymn .
At first Aunty Nan beat time to it feebly on the counterpane ; but when Joscelyn come to the verse , `` With mercy and with judgment , '' she fold her hand over her breast and smile .
When the hymn end , Joscelyn come over to the bed .
`` I be afraid I must say good-bye now , Aunty Nan , '' she say .
Then she saw that Aunty Nan have fall asleep .
She would not waken her , but she take from her breast the cluster of crimson rose she wear and slip them gently between the toil-worn finger .
`` Good-bye , dear , sweet mother-heart , '' she murmur .
Down-stairs she meet Mrs. William splendid in rustle black silk , her broad , rubicund face smiling , overflow with apology and welcome , which Joscelyn cut short coldly .
`` Thank you , Mrs. Morrison , but I can not possibly stay long .
No , thank you , I do n't care for any refreshment .
Jordan be go to take me back to Kensington at once .
I come out to see Aunty Nan . ''
`` I 'm certain she 'd be delight , '' say Mrs. William effusively .
`` She 's be talk about you for week . ''
`` Yes , it have make her very happy , '' say Joscelyn gravely .
`` And it have make me happy , too .
I love Aunty Nan , Mrs. Morrison , and I owe her much .
In all my life I have never meet a woman so purely , unselfishly good and noble and true . ''
`` Fancy now , '' say Mrs. William , rather overcome at hear this great singer pronounce such an encomium on quiet , timid old Aunty Nan .
Jordan drive Joscelyn back to Kensington ; and up-stairs in her room Aunty Nan sleep , with that rapt smile on her face and Joscelyn 's red rose in her hand .
Thus it be that Mrs. William find her , go in the next morning with her breakfast .
The sunlight crept over the pillow , light up the sweet old face and silver hair , and steal downward to the fade red rose on her breast .
Smiling and peaceful and happy lay Aunty Nan , for she have fall on the sleep that know no earthy wakening , while little Joscelyn sang .
V .
The Winning of Lucinda The marriage of a Penhallow be always the signal for a gathering of the Penhallows .
From the uttermost part of the earth they would come -- Penhallows by birth , and Penhallows by marriage and Penhallows by ancestry .
East Grafton be the ancient habitat of the race , and Penhallow Grange , where `` old '' John Penhallow live , be a Mecca to them .
As for the family itself , the exact kinship of all it various branch and ramification be a hard thing to define .
Old Uncle Julius Penhallow be look upon a a veritable wonder because he carry it all in his head and could tell on sight just what relation any one Penhallow be to any other Penhallow .
The rest make a blind guess at it , for the most part , and the young Penhallows let it go at loose cousinship .
In this instance it be Alice Penhallow , daughter of `` young '' John Penhallow , who be to be marry .
Alice be a nice girl , but she and her wed only pertain to this story in so far a they furnish a background for Lucinda ; hence nothing more need be say of her .
On the afternoon of her wedding day -- the Penhallows hold to the good , old-fashioned custom of even wedding with a rouse dance afterwards -- Penhallow Grange be fill to overflow with guest who have come there to have tea and rest themselves before go down to `` young '' John 's .
Many of them have drive fifty mile .
In the big autumnal orchard the young fry foregather and chat and coquet .
Up-stairs , in `` old '' Mrs. John 's bedroom , she and her married daughter hold high conclave .
`` Old '' John have establish himself with his son and son-in-law in the parlour , and the three daughter-in-law be make themselves at home in the blue sitting-room , ear-deep in harmless family gossip .
Lucinda and Romney Penhallow be also there .
Thin Mrs. Nathaniel Penhallow sit in a rocking chair and toast her toe at the grate , for the brilliant autumn afternoon be slightly chilly and Lucinda , a usual , have the window open .
She and plump Mrs. Frederick Penhallow do most of the talk .
Mrs. George Penhallow be rather out of it by reason of her newness .
She be George Penhallow 's second wife , marry only a year .
Hence , her contribution to the conversation be rather spasmodic , hurl in , a it be , by dead reckoning , be sometimes appropriate and sometimes savouring of a point of view not strictly Penhallowesque .
Romney Penhallow be sit in a corner , listen to the chatter of the woman , with the inscrutable smile that always vex Mrs. Frederick .
Mrs. George wonder within herself what he do there among the woman .
She also wonder just where he belong on the family tree .
He be not one of the uncle , yet he could not be much young than George .
`` Forty , if he be a day , '' be Mrs. George 's mental dictum , `` but a very handsome and fascinating man .
I never saw such a splendid chin and dimple . ''
Lucinda , with bronze-colored hair and the white of skin , defiant of merciless sunlight and revelling in the crisp air , sit on the sill of the open window behind the crimson vine leaf , look out into the garden , where dahlia flame and aster break into wave of purple and snow .
The ruddy light of the autumn afternoon give a sheen to the wave of her hair and bring out the exceed purity of her Greek outline .
Mrs. George know who Lucinda be -- a cousin of the second generation , and , in spite of her thirty-five year , the acknowledged beauty of the whole Penhallow connection .
She be one of those rare woman who keep their loveliness unmarred by the passage of year .
She have ripen and mature , but she have not grow old .
The old Penhallows be still incline , from sheer force of habit , to look upon her a a girl , and the young Penhallows hail her a one of themselves .
Yet Lucinda never ape girlishness ; good taste and a strong sense of humour preserve her amid many temptation thereto .
She be simply a beautiful , fully develop woman , with whom Time have declare a truce , young with a mellow youth which have nothing to do with year .
Mrs. George like and admire Lucinda .
Now , when Mrs. George like and admire any person , it be a matter of necessity with her to impart her opinion to the most convenient confidant .
In this case it be Romney Penhallow to whom Mrs. George remark sweetly : `` Really , do n't you think our Lucinda be look remarkably well this fall ? ''
It seem a very harmless , inane , well-meant question .
Poor Mrs. George might well be excuse for feeling bewilder over the effect .
Romney gather his long leg together , stand up , and sweep the unfortunate speaker a crush Penhallow bow of state .
`` Far be it from me to disagree with the opinion of a lady -- especially when it concern another lady , '' he say , a he leave the blue room .
Overcome by the mordant satire in his tone , Mrs. George glance speechlessly at Lucinda .
Behold , Lucinda have squarely turn her back on the party and be gaze out into the garden , with a very decided flush on the snowy curve of her neck and cheek .
Then Mrs. George look at her sister-in-law .
They be regard her with the tolerant amusement they might bestow on a blundering child .
Mrs. George experience that subtle prescience whereby it be give u to know that we have put our foot in it .
She felt herself turn an uncomfortable brick-red .
What Penhallow skeleton have she unwittingly jangle ?
Why , oh , why , be it such an evident breach of the propriety to praise Lucinda ?
Mrs. George be devoutly thankful that a summons to the tea-table rescue her from her mire of embarrassment .
The meal be spoil for her , however ; the mortify recollection of her mysterious blunder conspire with her curiosity to banish appetite .
As soon a possible after tea she decoy Mrs. Frederick out into the garden and in the dahlia walk solemnly demand the reason of it all .
Mrs. Frederick indulge in a laugh which put the mettle of her festal brown silk seam to the test .
`` My dear Cecilia , it be SO amusing , '' she say , a little patronizingly .
`` But WHY ! ''
cried Mrs. George , resent the patronage and the mystery .
`` What be so dreadful in what I say ?
Or so funny ?
And WHO be this Romney Penhallow who must n't be speak to ? ''
`` Oh , Romney be one of the Charlottetown Penhallows , '' explain Mrs. Frederick .
`` He be a lawyer there .
He be a first cousin of Lucinda 's and a second of George 's -- or be he ?
Oh , bother !
You must go to Uncle John if you want the genealogy .
I 'm in a chronic muddle concern Penhallow relationship .
And , a for Romney , of course you can speak to him about anything you like except Lucinda .
Oh , you innocent !
To ask him if he do n't think Lucinda be look well !
And right before her , too !
Of course he think you do it on purpose to tease him .
That be what make him so savage and sarcastic . ''
`` But WHY ? ''
persist Mrs. George , stick tenaciously to her point .
`` Has n't George tell you ? ''
`` No , '' say George 's wife in mild exasperation .
`` George have spend most of his time since we be marry tell me odd thing about the Penhallows , but he have n't get to that yet , evidently . ''
`` Why , my dear , it be our family romance .
Lucinda and Romney be in love with each other .
They have be in love with each other for fifteen year and in all that time they have never speak to each other once ! ''
`` Dear me ! ''
murmur Mrs. George , feel the inadequacy of mere language .
Was this a Penhallow method of courtship ?
`` But WHY ? ''
`` They have a quarrel fifteen year ago , '' say Mrs. Frederick patiently .
`` Nobody know how it originate or anything about it except that Lucinda herself admit it to u afterwards .
But , in the first flush of her rage , she tell Romney that she would never speak to him again as long a she live .
And HE say he would never speak to her until she speak first -- because , you see , a she be in the wrong she ought to make the first advance .
And they never have speak .
Everybody in the connection , I suppose , have take turn try to reconcile them , but nobody have succeed .
I do n't believe that Romney have ever so much a THOUGHT of any other woman in his whole life , and certainly Lucinda have never think of any other man .
You will notice she still wear Romney 's ring .
They 're practically engage still , of course .
And Romney say once that if Lucinda would just say one word , no matter what it be , even if it be something insulting , he would speak , too , and beg her pardon for his share in the quarrel -- because then , you see , he would not be break his word .
He have n't refer to the matter for year , but I presume that he be of the same mind still .
And they be just as much in love with each other a they ever be .
He 's always hang about where she be -- when other people be there , too , that be .
He avoid her like a plague when she be alone .
That be why he be stick out in the blue room with u to-day .
There do n't seem to be a particle of resentment between them .
If Lucinda would only speak !
But that Lucinda will not do . ''
`` Do n't you think she will yet ? ''
say Mrs. George .
Mrs. Frederick shake her crimped head sagely .
`` Not now .
The whole thing have harden too long .
Her pride will never let her speak .
We use to hope she would be trick into it by forgetfulness or accident -- we use to lay trap for her -- but all to no effect .
It be such a shame , too .
They be make for each other .
Do you know , I get cross when I begin to thrash the whole silly affair over like this .
Does n't it sound a if we be talk of the quarrel of two school-children ?
Of late year we have learn that it do not do to speak of Lucinda to Romney , even in the most commonplace way .
He seem to resent it . ''
`` HE ought to speak , '' cry Mrs. George warmly .
`` Even if she be in the wrong ten time over , he ought to overlook it and speak first . ''
`` But he wo n't .
And she wo n't .
You never saw two such determine mortal .
They get it from their grandfather on the mother 's side -- old Absalom Gordon .
There be no such stubbornness on the Penhallow side .
His obstinacy be a proverb , my dear -- actually a proverb .
What ever he say , he would stick to if the sky fell .
He be a terrible old man to swear , too , '' add Mrs. Frederick , drop into irrelevant reminiscence .
`` He spend a long while in a mining camp in his young day and he never get over it -- the habit of swearing , I mean .
It would have make your blood run cold , my dear , to have heard him go on at time .
And yet he be a real good old man every other way .
He could n't help it someway .
He try to , but he use to say that profanity come a natural to him a breathing .
It use to mortify his family terribly .
Fortunately , none of them take after him in that respect .
But he 's dead -- and one should n't speak ill of the dead .
I must go and get Mattie Penhallow to do my hair .
I would burst these sleeve clean out if I try to do it myself and I do n't want to dress over again .
You wo n't be likely to talk to Romney about Lucinda again , my dear Cecilia ? ''
`` Fifteen year ! ''
murmur Mrs. George helplessly to the dahlia .
`` Engaged for fifteen year and never speak to each other !
Dear heart and soul , think of it !
Oh , these Penhallows ! ''
Meanwhile , Lucinda , serenely unconscious that her love story be be mouth over by Mrs. Frederick in the dahlia garden , be dress for the wedding .
Lucinda still enjoy dress for a festivity , since the mirror still deal gently with her .
Moreover , she have a new dress .
Now , a new dress -- and especially one as nice a this -- be a rarity with Lucinda , who belong to a branch of the Penhallows note for be chronically hard up .
Indeed , Lucinda and her widowed mother be positively poor , and hence a new dress be an event in Lucinda 's existence .
An uncle have give her this one -- a beautiful , perishable thing , such a Lucinda would never have dare to choose for herself , but in which she revel with feminine delight .
It be of pale green voile -- a colour which bring out admirably the ruddy gloss of her hair and the clear brilliance of her skin .
When she have finish dress she look at herself in the mirror with frank delight .
Lucinda be not vain , but she be quite well aware of the fact of her beauty and take an impersonal pleasure in it , a if she be look at some finely paint picture by a master hand .
The form and face reflect in the glass satisfy her .
The puff and drapery of the green voile display to perfection the full , but not over-full , curve of her fine figure .
Lucinda lift her arm and touch a red rise to her lip with the hand upon which shine the frosty glitter of Romney 's diamond , look at the graceful slope of her shoulder and the splendid line of chin and throat with critical approval .
She note , too , how well the gown become her eye , bring out all the deep colour in them .
Lucinda have magnificent eye .
Once Romney have write a sonnet to them in which he compare their colour to ripe blueberry .
This may not sound poetical to you unless you know or remember just what the tint of ripe blueberry be -- dusky purple in some light , clear slate in others , and yet again in others the misty hue of early meadow violet .
`` You really look very well , '' remark the real Lucinda to the mirror Lucinda .
`` Nobody would think you be an old maid .
But you be .
Alice Penhallow , who be to be marry to-night , be a child of five when you think of be marry fifteen year ago .
That make you an old maid , my dear .
Well , it be your own fault , and it will continue to be your own fault , you stubborn offshoot of a stubborn breed ! ''
She fling her train out straight and pull on her glove .
`` I do hope I wo n't get any spot on this dress to-night , '' she reflect .
`` It will have to do me for a gala dress for a year at least -- and I have a creepy conviction that it be fearfully spottable .
Bless Uncle Mark 's good , uncalculating heart !
How I would have detest it if he have give me something sensible and useful and ugly -- a Aunt Emilia would have do . ''
They all go to `` young '' John Penhallow 's at early moonrise .
Lucinda drive over the two mile of hill and dale with a youthful second cousin , by name , Carey Penhallow .
The wedding be quite a brilliant affair .
Lucinda seem to pervade the social atmosphere , and everywhere she go a little ripple of admiration trail after her like a wave .
She be undeniably a belle , yet she find herself feel faintly bore and be rather glad than otherwise when the guest begin to fray off .
`` I 'm afraid I 'm lose my capacity for enjoyment , '' she think , a little drearily .
`` Yes , I must be grow old .
That be what it mean when social function begin to bore you . ''
It be that unlucky Mrs. George who blunder again .
She be stand on the veranda when Carey Penhallow dash up .
`` Tell Lucinda that I ca n't take her back to the Grange .
I have to drive Mark and Cissy Penhallow to Bright River to catch the two o'clock express .
There will be plenty of chance for her with the others . ''
At this moment George Penhallow , hold his rear horse with difficulty , shout for his wife .
Mrs. George , all in a flurry , dash back into the still crowd hall .
Exactly to whom she give her message be never know to any of the Penhallows .
But a tall , ruddy-haired girl , dress in pale green organdy -- Anne Shirley from Avonlea -- tell Marilla Cuthbert and Rachel Lynde a a joke the next morning how a chubby little woman in a bright pink fascinator have clutch her by the arm , and gasp out : `` Carey Penhallow ca n't take you -- he say you 're to look out for someone else , '' and be go before she could answer or turn around .
Thus it be that Lucinda , when she come out to the veranda step , find herself unaccountably desert .
All the Grange Penhallows be go ; Lucinda realize this after a few moment of bewildered seek , and she understand that if she be to get to the Grange that night she must walk .
Plainly there be nobody to take her .
Lucinda be angry .
It be not pleasant to find yourself forgotten and neglect .
It be still less pleasant to walk home alone along a country road , at one o'clock in the morning , wear a pale green voile .
Lucinda be not prepared for such a walk .
She have nothing on her foot save thin-soled shoe , and her only wrap be a flimsy fascinator and a short coat .
`` What a guy I shall look , stalk home alone in this rig , '' she think crossly .
There be no help for it , unless she confess her plight to some of the stranger guest and beg a drive home .
Lucinda 's pride scorn such a request and the admission of neglect it involve .
No , she would walk , since that be all there be to it ; but she would not go by the main road to be star at by all and sundry who might pass her .
There be a short cut by way of a lane across the field ; she know every inch of it , although she have not traverse it for year .
She gather up the green voile as trimly a possible , slip around the house in the kindly shadow , pick her way across the side lawn , and find a gate which open into a birch-bordered lane where the frosted tree shine with silvery-golden radiance in the moonlight .
Lucinda flit down the lane , grow angry at every step a the realization of how shamefully she seem to have be treat come home to her .
She believe that nobody have think about her at all , which be tenfold bad than premeditate neglect .
As she come to the gate at the low end of the lane a man who be lean over it start , with a quick intake of his breath , which , in any other man than Romney Penhallow , or for any other woman than Lucinda Penhallow , would have be an exclamation of surprise .
Lucinda recognize him with a great deal of annoyance and a little relief .
She would not have to walk home alone .
But with Romney Penhallow !
Would he think she have contrive it so purposely ?
Romney silently open the gate for her , silently latch it behind her , and silently fell into step beside her .
Down across a velvety sweep of field they go ; the air be frosty , calm and still ; over the world lay a haze of moonshine and mist that convert East Grafton 's prosaic hill and field into a shimmering fairyland .
At first Lucinda felt angrier than ever .
What a ridiculous situation !
How the Penhallows would laugh over it !
As for Romney , he , too , be angry with the trick impish chance have play him .
He like be the butt of an awkward situation as little a most men ; and certainly to be oblige to walk home over moonlit field at one o'clock in the morning with the woman he have love and never speak to for fifteen year be the irony of fate with a vengeance .
Would she think he have scheme for it ?
And how the deuce do she come to be walk home from the wedding at all ?
By the time they have cross the field and reach the wild cherry lane beyond it , Lucinda 's anger be master by her save sense of humour .
She be even smile a little maliciously under her fascinator .
The lane be a place of enchantment -- a long , moonlit colonnade adown which beguile wood nymph might have foot it featly .
The moonshine fell through the arching bough and make a mosaic of silver light and clear-cut shadow for the unfriendly lover to walk in .
On either side be the hovering gloom of the wood , and around them be a great silence unstirred by wind or murmur .
Midway in the lane Lucinda be attack by a sentimental recollection .
She think of the last time Romney and she have walk home together through this very lane , from a party at `` young '' John 's .
It have be moonlight then too , and -- Lucinda check a sigh -- they have walk hand in hand .
Just here , by the big gray beech , he have stop her and kiss her .
Lucinda wonder if he be think of it , too , and steal a look at him from under the lace border of her fascinator .
But he be stride moodily along with his hand in his pocket , and his hat pull down over his eye , pass the old beech without a glance at it .
Lucinda check another sigh , gather up an escaped flutter of voile , and march on .
Past the lane a range of three silvery harvest field slop down to Peter Penhallow 's brook -- a wide , shallow stream bridge over in the olden day by the mossy trunk of an ancient fallen tree .
When Lucinda and Romney arrive at the brook they gaze at the brawling water blankly .
Lucinda remember that she must not speak to Romney just in time to prevent an exclamation of dismay .
There be no tree !
There be no bridge of any kind over the brook !
Here be a predicament !
But before Lucinda could do more than despairingly ask herself what be to be do now , Romney answer -- not in word , but in deed .
He coolly pick Lucinda up in his arm , a if she have be a child instead of a full grown woman of no mean avoirdupois , and begin to wade with her through the water .
Lucinda gasp helplessly .
She could not forbid him and she be so choked with rage over his presumption that she could not have speak in any case .
Then come the catastrophe .
Romney 's foot slip on a treacherous round stone -- there be a tremendous splash -- and Romney and Lucinda Penhallow be sit down in the middle of Peter Penhallow 's brook .
Lucinda be the first to regain her foot .
About her clung in heart-breaking limpness the ruin voile .
The remembrance of all her wrong that night rush over her soul , and her eye blaze in the moonlight .
Lucinda Penhallow have never be so angry in her life .
`` YOU D -- D IDIOT ! ''
she say , in a voice that literally shake with rage .
Romney meekly scramble up the bank after her .
`` I 'm awfully sorry , Lucinda , '' he say , strive with uncertain success to keep a suspicious quiver of laughter out of his tone .
`` It be wretchedly clumsy of me , but that pebble turn right under my foot .
Please forgive me -- for that -- and for other thing . ''
Lucinda deign no answer .
She stand on a flat stone and wring the water from the poor green voile .
Romney survey her apprehensively .
`` Hurry , Lucinda , '' he entreat .
`` You will catch your death of cold . ''
`` I never take cold , '' answer Lucinda , with chatter teeth .
`` And it be my dress I be think of -- be think of .
You have more need to hurry .
You be sop wet yourself and you know you be subject to cold .
There -- come . ''
Lucinda pick up the stringy train , which have be so brave and buoyant five minute before , and start up the field at a brisk rate .
Romney come up to her and slip his arm through hers in the old way .
For a time they walk along in silence .
Then Lucinda begin to shake with inward laughter .
She laugh silently for the whole length of the field ; and at the line fence between Peter Penhallow 's land and the Grange acres she pause , throw back the fascinator from her face , and look at Romney defiantly .
`` You be think of -- THAT , '' she cry , `` and I be think of it .
And we will go on , think of it at interval for the rest of our life .
But if you ever mention it to me I 'll never forgive you , Romney Penhallow ! ''
`` I never will , '' Romney promise .
There be more than a suspicion of laughter in his voice this time , but Lucinda do not choose to resent it .
She do not speak again until they reach the Grange gate .
Then she face him solemnly .
`` It be a case of atavism , '' she say .
`` Old Grandfather Gordon be to blame for it . ''
At the Grange almost everybody be in bed .
What with the guest straggle home at interval and hurry sleepily off to their room , nobody have miss Lucinda , each set suppose she be with some other set .
Mrs. Frederick , Mrs. Nathaniel and Mrs. George alone be up .
The perennially chilly Mrs. Nathaniel have kindle a fire of chip in the blue room grate to warm her foot before retiring , and the three woman be discuss the wedding in subdue tone when the door open and the stately form of Lucinda , stately even in the dragged voile , appear , with the damp Romney behind her .
`` Lucinda Penhallow ! ''
gasped they , one and all .
`` I be leave to walk home , '' say Lucinda coolly .
`` So Romney and I come across the field .
There be no bridge over the brook , and when he be carry me over he slip and we fell in .
That be all .
No , Cecilia , I never take cold , so do n't worry .
Yes , my dress be ruin , but that be of no consequence .
No , thank you , Cecilia , I do not care for a hot drink .
Romney , do go and take off those wet clothes of yours immediately .
No , Cecilia , I will NOT take a hot footbath .
I be go straight to bed .
Good night . ''
When the door close on the pair the three sister-in-law star at each other .
Mrs. Frederick , feel herself incapable of express her sensation originally , take refuge in a quotation : '' ` Do I sleep , do I dream , do I wonder and doubt ?
Is thing what they seem , or be vision about ? ' ''
`` There will be another Penhallow wedding soon , '' say Mrs. Nathaniel , with a long breath .
`` Lucinda have speak to Romney AT LAST . ''
`` Oh , WHAT do you suppose she say to him ? ''
cried Mrs. George .
`` My dear Cecilia , '' say Mrs. Frederick , `` we shall never know . ''
They never do know .
VI .
Old Man Shaw 's Girl `` Day after to-morrow -- day after to-morrow , '' say Old Man Shaw , rub his long slender hand together gleefully .
`` I have to keep say it over and over , so a to really believe it .
It seem far too good to be true that I 'm to have Blossom again .
And everything be ready .
Yes , I think everything be ready , except a bit of cooking .
And wo n't this orchard be a surprise to her !
I 'm just go to bring her out here as soon a I can , never say a word .
I 'll fetch her through the spruce lane , and when we come to the end of the path I 'll step back casual-like , and let her go out from under the tree alone , never suspect .
It 'll be worth ten time the trouble to see her big , brown eye open wide and hear her say , ` Oh , daddy !
Why , daddy ! ' ''
He rub his hand again and laugh softly to himself .
He be a tall , bent old man , whose hair be snow white , but whose face be fresh and rosy .
His eye be a boy 's eye , large , blue and merry , and his mouth have never get over a youthful trick of smile at any provocation -- and , oft-times , at no provocation at all .
To be sure , White Sands people would not have give you the most favourable opinion in the world of Old Man Shaw .
First and foremost , they would have tell you that he be `` shiftless , '' and have let his bit of a farm run out while he potter with flower and bug , or ramble aimlessly about in the wood , or read book along the shore .
Perhaps it be true ; but the old farm yield him a living , and far than that Old Man Shaw have no ambition .
He be as blithe a a pilgrim on a pathway climb to the west .
He have learn the rare secret that you must take happiness when you find it -- that there be no use in mark the place and come back to it at a more convenient season , because it will not be there then .
And it be very easy to be happy if you know , a Old Man Shaw most thoroughly knew , how to find pleasure in little thing .
He enjoy life , he have always enjoy life and help others to enjoy it ; consequently his life be a success , whatever White Sands people might think of it .
What if he have not `` improve '' his farm ?
There be some people to whom life will never be anything more than a kitchen garden ; and there be others to whom it will always be a royal palace with dome and minaret of rainbow fancy .
The orchard of which he be so proud be a yet little more than the substance of thing hop for -- a flourishing plantation of young tree which would amount to something later on .
Old Man Shaw 's house be on the crest of a bare , sunny hill , with a few staunch old fir and spruce behind it -- the only tree that could resist the full sweep of the wind that blow bitterly up from the sea at time .
Fruit tree would never grow near it , and this have be a great grief to Sara .
`` Oh , daddy , if we could just have an orchard ! ''
she have be wont to say wistfully , when other farmhouse in White Sands be smother whitely in apple bloom .
And when she have go away , and her father have nothing to look forward to save her return , he be determine she should find an orchard when she come back .
Over the southward hill , warmly shelter by spruce wood and slop to the sunshine , be a little field , so fertile that all the slack management of a life-time have not avail to exhaust it .
Here Old Man Shaw set out his orchard and saw it flourish , watch and tend it until he come to know each tree a a child and love it .
His neighbour laugh at him , and say that the fruit of an orchard so far away from the house would all be steal .
But a yet there be no fruit , and when the time come for bearing there would be enough and to spare .
`` Blossom and me 'll get all we want , and the boy can have the rest , if they want 'em bad 'n they want a good conscience , '' say that unworldly , unbusinesslike Old Man Shaw .
On his way back home from his darling orchard he find a rare fern in the wood and dug it up for Sara -- she have love fern .
He plant it at the shady , shelter side of the house and then sit down on the old bench by the garden gate to read her last letter -- the letter that be only a note , because she be come home soon .
He know every word of it by heart , but that do not spoil the pleasure of re-reading it every half-hour .
Old Man Shaw have not marry until late in life , and have , so White Sands people say , select a wife with his usual judgment -- which , be interpret , mean no judgment at all ; otherwise , he would never have marry Sara Glover , a mere slip of a girl , with big brown eye like a frightened wood creature 's , and the delicate , fleet bloom of a spring Mayflower .
`` The last woman in the world for a farmer 's wife -- no strength or get-up about her . ''
Neither could White Sands folk understand what on earth Sara Glover have marry him for .
`` Well , the fool crop be the only one that never fail . ''
Old Man Shaw -- he be Old Man Shaw even then , although he be only forty -- and his girl bride have trouble themselves not at all about White Sands opinion .
They have one year of perfect happiness , which be always worth living for , even if the rest of life be a dreary pilgrimage , and then Old Man Shaw find himself alone again , except for little Blossom .
She be christen Sara , after her dead mother , but she be always Blossom to her father -- the precious little blossom whose plucking have cost the mother her life .
Sara Glover 's people , especially a wealthy aunt in Montreal , have want to take the child , but Old Man Shaw grow almost fierce over the suggestion .
He would give his baby to no one .
A woman be hire to look after the house , but it be the father who care for the baby in the main .
He be a tender and faithful and deft a a woman .
Sara never miss a mother 's care , and she grow up into a creature of life and light and beauty , a constant delight to all who know her .
She have a way of embroider life with star .
She be dower with all the charm characteristic of both parent , with a resilient vitality and activity which have pertain to neither of them .
When she be ten year old she have pack all hireling off , and keep house for her father for six delightful year -- year in which they be father and daughter , brother and sister , and `` chum . ''
Sara never go to school , but her father saw to her education after a fashion of his own .
When their work be do they live in the wood and field , in the little garden they have make on the sheltered side of the house , or on the shore , where sunshine and storm be to them equally lovely and beloved .
Never be comradeship more perfect or more wholly satisfactory .
`` Just wrap up in each other , '' say White Sands folk , half-enviously , half-disapprovingly .
When Sara be sixteen Mrs. Adair , the wealthy aunt aforesaid , pounce down on White Sands in a glamour of fashion and culture and outer worldliness .
She bombard Old Man Shaw with such argument that he have to succumb .
It be a shame that a girl like Sara should grow up in a place like White Sands , `` with no advantage and no education , '' say Mrs. Adair scornfully , not understand that wisdom and knowledge be two entirely different thing .
`` At least let me give my dear sister 's child what I would have give my own daughter if I have have one , '' she plead tearfully .
`` Let me take her with me and send her to a good school for a few year .
Then , if she wish , she may come back to you , of course . ''
Privately , Mrs. Adair do not for a moment believe that Sara would want to come back to White Sands , and her queer old father , after three year of the life she would give her .
Old Man Shaw yield , influence thereto not at all by Mrs. Adair 's readily flow tear , but greatly by his conviction that justice to Sara demand it .
Sara herself do not want to go ; she protest and plead ; but her father , have become convinced that it be best for her to go , be inexorable .
Everything , even her own feeling , must give way to that .
But she be to come back to him without let or hindrance when her `` schooling '' be do .
It be only on have this most clearly understood that Sara would consent to go at all .
Her last word , call back to her father through her tear a she and her aunt drive down the lane , be , `` I 'll be back , daddy .
In three year I 'll be back .
Do n't cry , but just look forward to that . ''
He have look forward to it through the three long , lonely year that follow , in all of which he never saw his darling .
Half a continent be between them and Mrs. Adair have veto vacation visit , under some specious pretense .
But every week bring it letter from Sara .
Old Man Shaw have every one of them , tie up with one of her old blue hair ribbon , and keep in her mother 's little rose-wood work-box in the parlour .
He spend every Sunday afternoon re-reading them , with her photograph before him .
He live alone , refuse to be pester with kind help , but he keep the house in beautiful order .
`` A good housekeeper than farmer , '' say White Sands people .
He would have nothing alter .
When Sara come back she be not to be hurt by change .
It never occur to him that she might be change herself .
And now those three interminable year be go , and Sara be come home .
She write him nothing of her aunt 's pleading and reproach and ready , futile tear ; she write only that she would graduate in June and start for home a week later .
Thenceforth Old Man Shaw go about in a state of beatitude , make ready for her homecoming .
As he sit on the bench in the sunshine , with the blue sea sparkling and crinkle down at the foot of the green slope , he reflect with satisfaction that all be in perfect order .
There be nothing left to do save count the hour until that beautiful , longed-for day after to-morrow .
He give himself over to a reverie , as sweet a a day-dream in a haunted valley .
The red rose be out in bloom .
Sara have always love those red rose -- they be as vivid a herself , with all her own fullness of life and joy of living .
And , besides these , a miracle have happen in Old Man Shaw 's garden .
In one corner be a rose-bush which have never bloom , despite all the coax they have give it -- `` the sulky rose-bush , '' Sara have be wont to call it .
Lo !
this summer have fling the hoarded sweetness of year into plentiful white blossom , like shallow ivory cup with a haunting , spicy fragrance .
It be in honour of Sara 's home-coming -- so Old Man Shaw like to fancy .
All thing , even the sulky rose-bush , know she be come back , and be make glad because of it .
He be gloat over Sara 's letter when Mrs. Peter Blewett come .
She tell him she have run up to see how he be get on , and if he want anything see to before Sara come .
`` No 'm , thank you , ma'am .
Everything be attend to .
I could n't let anyone else prepare for Blossom .
Only to think , ma'am , she 'll be home the day after to-morrow .
I 'm just fill clear through , body , soul , and spirit , with joy to think of have my little Blossom at home again . ''
Mrs. Blewett smile sourly .
When Mrs. Blewett smile it foretokened trouble , and wise people have learn to have sudden business elsewhere before the smile could be translate into word .
But Old Man Shaw have never learn to be wise where Mrs. Blewett be concern , although she have be his near neighbour for year , and have pester his life out with advice and `` neighbourly turn . ''
Mrs. Blewett be one with whom life have go awry .
The effect on her be to render happiness to other people a personal insult .
She resent Old Man Shaw 's beam delight in his daughter 's return , and she `` consider it her duty '' to rub the bloom off straightway .
`` Do you think Sary 'll be content in White Sands now ? ''
she ask .
Old Man Shaw look slightly bewilder .
`` Of course she 'll be content , '' he say slowly .
`` Is n't it her home ?
And ai n't I here ? ''
Mrs. Blewett smile again , with double distilled contempt for such simplicity .
`` Well , it 's a good thing you 're so sure of it , I suppose .
If 't be my daughter that be come back to White Sands , after three year of fashionable life among rich , stylish folk , and at a swell school , I would n't have a minute 's peace of mind .
I 'd know perfectly well that she 'd look down on everything here , and be discontent and miserable . ''
`` YOUR daughter might , '' say Old Man Shaw , with more sarcasm than he have suppose he have possess , `` but Blossom wo n't . ''
Mrs. Blewett shrug her sharp shoulder .
`` Maybe not .
It 's to be hop not , for both your sake , I 'm sure .
But I 'd be worry if 't be me .
Sary 's be live among fine folk , and have a gay , exciting time , and it stand to reason she 'll think White Sands fearful lonesome and dull .
Look at Lauretta Bradley .
She be up in Boston for just a month last winter and she 's never be able to endure White Sands since . ''
`` Lauretta Bradley and Sara Shaw be two different people , '' say Sara 's father , try to smile .
`` And your house , too , '' pursue Mrs. Blewett ruthlessly .
`` It 's such a queer , little , old place .
What 'll she think of it after her aunt 's ?
I 've hear tell Mrs. Adair live in a perfect palace .
I 'll just warn you kindly that Sary 'll probably look down on you , and you might as well be prepare for it .
Of course , I suppose she kind of think she have to come back , see she promise you so solemn she would .
But I 'm certain she do n't want to , and I do n't blame her either . ''
Even Mrs. Blewett have to stop for breath , and Old Man Shaw find his opportunity .
He have listen , daze and shrink , a if she be deal him physical blow , but now a swift change sweep over him .
His blue eye flash ominously , straight into Mrs. Blewett 's straggling , ferrety gray orb .
`` If you 're say your say , Martha Blewett , you can go , '' he say passionately .
`` I 'm not go to listen to another such word .
Take yourself out of my sight , and your malicious tongue out of my hearing ! ''
Mrs. Blewett go , too dumfounded by such an unheard-of outburst in mild Old Man Shaw to say a word of defence or attack .
When she have go Old Man Shaw , the fire all fade from his eye , sink back on his bench .
His delight be dead ; his heart be full of pain and bitterness .
Martha Blewett be a warped and ill-natured woman , but he fear there be altogether too much truth in what she say .
Why have he never think of it before ?
Of course White Sands would seem dull and lonely to Blossom ; of course the little gray house where she be bear would seem a poor abode after the splendour of her aunt 's home .
Old Man Shaw walk through his garden and look at everything with new eye .
How poor and simple everything be !
How sagging and weather-beaten the old house !
He go in , and up-stairs to Sara 's room .
It be neat and clean , just a she have leave it three year ago .
But it be small and dark ; the ceiling be discolour , the furniture old-fashioned and shabby ; she would think it a poor , mean place .
Even the orchard over the hill bring him no comfort now .
Blossom would not care for orchard .
She would be ashamed of her stupid old father and the barren farm .
She would hate White Sands , and chafe at the dull existence , and look down on everything that go to make up his uneventful life .
Old Man Shaw be unhappy enough that night to have satisfy even Mrs. Blewett have she know .
He saw himself a he think White Sands folk must see him -- a poor , shiftless , foolish old man , who have only one thing in the world worthwhile , his little girl , and have not be of enough account to keep her .
`` Oh , Blossom , Blossom ! ''
