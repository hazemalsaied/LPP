Toomai know that so long a he lay still on Kala Nag 's neck nothing would happen to him , for even in the rush and scramble of a Keddah drive a wild elephant do not reach up with his trunk and drag a man off the neck of a tame elephant .
And these elephant be not think of men that night .
Once they start and put their ear forward when they hear the chinking of a leg iron in the forest , but it be Pudmini , Petersen Sahib 's pet elephant , her chain snap short off , grunt , snuffle up the hillside .
She must have break her picket and come straight from Petersen Sahib 's camp ; and Little Toomai saw another elephant , one that he do not know , with deep rope gall on his back and breast .
He , too , must have run away from some camp in the hill about .
At last there be no sound of any more elephant move in the forest , and Kala Nag roll out from his station between the tree and go into the middle of the crowd , cluck and gurgling , and all the elephant begin to talk in their own tongue , and to move about .
Still lie down , Little Toomai look down upon score and score of broad back , and wag ear , and toss trunk , and little rolling eye .
He hear the click of tusk a they cross other tusk by accident , and the dry rustle of trunk twin together , and the chafing of enormous side and shoulder in the crowd , and the incessant flick and hissh of the great tail .
Then a cloud come over the moon , and he sit in black darkness .
But the quiet , steady hustling and push and gurgle go on just the same .
He know that there be elephant all round Kala Nag , and that there be no chance of back him out of the assembly ; so he set his teeth and shiver .
In a Keddah at least there be torchlight and shouting , but here he be all alone in the dark , and once a trunk come up and touch him on the knee .
Then an elephant trumpet , and they all take it up for five or ten terrible second .
The dew from the tree above spatter down like rain on the unseen back , and a dull booming noise begin , not very loud at first , and Little Toomai could not tell what it be .
But it grow and grow , and Kala Nag lift up one forefoot and then the other , and bring them down on the ground -- one-two , one-two , as steadily a trip-hammers .
The elephant be stamp all together now , and it sound like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave .
The dew fell from the tree till there be no more leave to fall , and the booming go on , and the ground rock and shiver , and Little Toomai put his hand up to his ear to shut out the sound .
But it be all one gigantic jar that run through him -- this stamp of hundred of heavy foot on the raw earth .
Once or twice he could feel Kala Nag and all the others surge forward a few stride , and the thumping would change to the crush sound of juicy green thing be bruise , but in a minute or two the boom of foot on hard earth begin again .
A tree be creak and groan somewhere near him .
He put out his arm and felt the bark , but Kala Nag move forward , still tramp , and he could not tell where he be in the clearing .
There be no sound from the elephant , except once , when two or three little calf squeak together .
Then he hear a thump and a shuffle , and the booming go on .
It must have last fully two hour , and Little Toomai ache in every nerve , but he know by the smell of the night air that the dawn be come .
The morning break in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hill , and the booming stop with the first ray , a though the light have be an order .
Before Little Toomai have get the ring out of his head , before even he have shift his position , there be not an elephant in sight except Kala Nag , Pudmini , and the elephant with the rope-galls , and there be neither sign nor rustle nor whisper down the hillside to show where the others have go .
Little Toomai star again and again .
The clearing , a he remember it , have grow in the night .
More tree stand in the middle of it , but the undergrowth and the jungle grass at the side have be roll back .
Little Toomai star once more .
Now he understand the trampling .
The elephant have stamp out more room -- have stamp the thick grass and juicy cane to trash , the trash into sliver , the sliver into tiny fiber , and the fiber into hard earth .
`` Wah ! ''
say Little Toomai , and his eye be very heavy .
`` Kala Nag , my lord , let u keep by Pudmini and go to Petersen Sahib 's camp , or I shall drop from thy neck . ''
The third elephant watch the two go away , snort , wheel round , and take his own path .
He may have belong to some little native king 's establishment , fifty or sixty or a hundred mile away .
Two hour later , a Petersen Sahib be eat early breakfast , his elephant , who have be double chain that night , begin to trumpet , and Pudmini , mire to the shoulder , with Kala Nag , very footsore , shamble into the camp .
Little Toomai 's face be gray and pinch , and his hair be full of leaf and drench with dew , but he try to salute Petersen Sahib , and cry faintly : `` The dance -- the elephant dance !
I have see it , and -- I die ! ''
As Kala Nag sit down , he slide off his neck in a dead faint .
But , since native child have no nerve worth speaking of , in two hour he be lie very contentedly in Petersen Sahib 's hammock with Petersen Sahib 's shooting-coat under his head , and a glass of warm milk , a little brandy , with a dash of quinine , inside of him , and while the old hairy , scar hunter of the jungle sit three deep before him , look at him a though he be a spirit , he tell his tale in short word , a a child will , and wind up with : `` Now , if I lie in one word , send men to see , and they will find that the elephant folk have trample down more room in their dance-room , and they will find ten and ten , and many time ten , track lead to that dance-room .
They make more room with their foot .
I have see it .
Kala Nag take me , and I saw .
Also Kala Nag be very leg-weary ! ''
Little Toomai lay back and sleep all through the long afternoon and into the twilight , and while he sleep Petersen Sahib and Machua Appa follow the track of the two elephant for fifteen mile across the hill .
Petersen Sahib have spend eighteen year in catch elephant , and he have only once before find such a dance-place .
Machua Appa have no need to look twice at the clearing to see what have be do there , or to scratch with his toe in the packed , ram earth .
`` The child speak truth , '' say he .
`` All this be do last night , and I have count seventy track cross the river .
See , Sahib , where Pudmini 's leg-iron cut the bark of that tree !
Yes ; she be there too . ''
They look at one another and up and down , and they wonder .
For the way of elephant be beyond the wit of any man , black or white , to fathom .
`` Forty year and five , '' say Machua Appa , `` have I follow my lord , the elephant , but never have I hear that any child of man have see what this child have see .
By all the Gods of the Hills , it be -- what can we say ? ''
and he shake his head .
When they get back to camp it be time for the evening meal .
Petersen Sahib eat alone in his tent , but he give order that the camp should have two sheep and some fowl , as well a a double ration of flour and rice and salt , for he know that there would be a feast .
Big Toomai have come up hotfoot from the camp in the plain to search for his son and his elephant , and now that he have find them he look at them a though he be afraid of them both .
And there be a feast by the blazing campfire in front of the line of picketed elephant , and Little Toomai be the hero of it all .
And the big brown elephant catcher , the tracker and driver and roper , and the men who know all the secret of break the wild elephant , pass him from one to the other , and they mark his forehead with blood from the breast of a newly kill jungle-cock , to show that he be a forester , initiate and free of all the jungle .
And at last , when the flame die down , and the red light of the log make the elephant look a though they have be dip in blood too , Machua Appa , the head of all the driver of all the Keddahs -- Machua Appa , Petersen Sahib 's other self , who have never see a make road in forty year : Machua Appa , who be so great that he have no other name than Machua Appa , -- leap to his foot , with Little Toomai hold high in the air above his head , and shout : `` Listen , my brother .
Listen , too , you my lord in the line there , for I , Machua Appa , be speak !
This little one shall no more be call Little Toomai , but Toomai of the Elephants , a his great-grandfather be call before him .
What never man have see he have see through the long night , and the favor of the elephant-folk and of the Gods of the Jungles be with him .
He shall become a great tracker .
He shall become great than I , even I , Machua Appa !
He shall follow the new trail , and the stale trail , and the mixed trail , with a clear eye !
He shall take no harm in the Keddah when he run under their belly to rope the wild tusker ; and if he slip before the foot of the charge bull elephant , the bull elephant shall know who he be and shall not crush him .
Aihai !
my lord in the chain , '' -- he whirl up the line of picket -- `` here be the little one that have see your dance in your hidden place , -- the sight that never man saw !
Give him honor , my lord !
Salaam karo , my child .
Make your salute to Toomai of the Elephants !
Gunga Pershad , ahaa !
Hira Guj , Birchi Guj , Kuttar Guj , ahaa !
Pudmini , -- thou hast see him at the dance , and thou too , Kala Nag , my pearl among elephant !
-- ahaa !
Together !
To Toomai of the Elephants .
Barrao ! ''
And at that last wild yell the whole line fling up their trunk till the tip touch their forehead , and break out into the full salute -- the crash trumpet-peal that only the Viceroy of India hears , the Salaamut of the Keddah .
But it be all for the sake of Little Toomai , who have see what never man have see before -- the dance of the elephant at night and alone in the heart of the Garo hill !
Shiv and the Grasshopper -LRB- The song that Toomai 's mother sang to the baby -RRB- Shiv , who pour the harvest and make the wind to blow , Sitting at the doorway of a day of long ago , Gave to each his portion , food and toil and fate , From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate .
All thing make he -- Shiva the Preserver .
Mahadeo !
Mahadeo !
He make all , -- Thorn for the camel , fodder for the kine , And mother 's heart for sleepy head , O little son of mine !
Wheat he give to rich folk , millet to the poor , Broken scrap for holy men that beg from door to door ; Battle to the tiger , carrion to the kite , And rag and bone to wicked wolf without the wall at night .
Naught he find too lofty , none he saw too low -- Parbati beside him watch them come and go ; Thought to cheat her husband , turn Shiv to jest -- Stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast .
So she trick him , Shiva the Preserver .
Mahadeo !
Mahadeo !
Turn and see .
Tall be the camel , heavy be the kine , But this be Least of Little Things , O little son of mine !
When the dole be end , laughingly she say , `` Master , of a million mouth , be not one unfed ? ''
Laughing , Shiv make answer , `` All have have their part , Even he , the little one , hide ` neath thy heart . ''
From her breast she pluck it , Parbati the thief , Saw the Least of Little Things gnaw a new-grown leaf !
Saw and fear and wonder , make prayer to Shiv , Who hath surely give meat to all that live .
All thing make he -- Shiva the Preserver .
Mahadeo !
Mahadeo !
He make all , -- Thorn for the camel , fodder for the kine , And mother 's heart for sleepy head , O little son of mine !
Her Majesty 's Servants You can work it out by Fractions or by simple Rule of Three , But the way of Tweedle-dum be not the way of Tweedle-dee .
You can twist it , you can turn it , you can plait it till you drop , But the way of Pilly Winky 's not the way of Winkie Pop !
It have be rain heavily for one whole month -- rain on a camp of thirty thousand men and thousand of camel , elephant , horse , bullock , and mules all gather together at a place call Rawal Pindi , to be review by the Viceroy of India .
He be receive a visit from the Amir of Afghanistan -- a wild king of a very wild country .
The Amir have bring with him for a bodyguard eight hundred men and horse who have never see a camp or a locomotive before in their life -- savage men and savage horse from somewhere at the back of Central Asia .
Every night a mob of these horse would be sure to break their heel rope and stampede up and down the camp through the mud in the dark , or the camel would break loose and run about and fall over the rope of the tent , and you can imagine how pleasant that be for men try to go to sleep .
My tent lay far away from the camel line , and I think it be safe .
But one night a man pop his head in and shout , `` Get out , quick !
They 're come !
My tent 's go ! ''
I know who `` they '' be , so I put on my boot and waterproof and scuttle out into the slush .
Little Vixen , my fox terrier , go out through the other side ; and then there be a roaring and a grunting and bubbling , and I saw the tent cave in , a the pole snap , and begin to dance about like a mad ghost .
A camel have blunder into it , and wet and angry a I be , I could not help laughing .
Then I run on , because I do not know how many camel might have get loose , and before long I be out of sight of the camp , plow my way through the mud .
At last I fell over the tail-end of a gun , and by that know I be somewhere near the artillery line where the cannon be stack at night .
As I do not want to plowter about any more in the drizzle and the dark , I put my waterproof over the muzzle of one gun , and make a sort of wigwam with two or three rammer that I find , and lay along the tail of another gun , wonder where Vixen have get to , and where I might be .
Just a I be get ready to go to sleep I hear a jingle of harness and a grunt , and a mule pass me shake his wet ear .
He belong to a screw-gun battery , for I could hear the rattle of the strap and ring and chain and thing on his saddle pad .
The screw-guns be tiny little cannon make in two piece , that be screw together when the time come to use them .
They be take up mountain , anywhere that a mule can find a road , and they be very useful for fight in rocky country .
Behind the mule there be a camel , with his big soft foot squelch and slip in the mud , and his neck bobbing to and fro like a strayed hen 's .
Luckily , I know enough of beast language -- not wild-beast language , but camp-beast language , of course -- from the native to know what he be say .
He must have be the one that flop into my tent , for he call to the mule , `` What shall I do ?
Where shall I go ?
I have fight with a white thing that wave , and it take a stick and hit me on the neck . ''
-LRB- That be my broken tent pole , and I be very glad to know it . -RRB-
`` Shall we run on ? ''
`` Oh , it be you , '' say the mule , `` you and your friend , that have be disturb the camp ?
All right .
You 'll be beat for this in the morning .
But I may as well give you something on account now . ''
I hear the harness jingle a the mule back and catch the camel two kick in the rib that ring like a drum .
`` Another time , '' he say , `` you 'll know good than to run through a mule battery at night , shout ` Thieves and fire ! '
Sit down , and keep your silly neck quiet . ''
The camel double up camel-fashion , like a two-foot rule , and sit down whimpering .
There be a regular beat of hoof in the darkness , and a big troop-horse canter up as steadily a though he be on parade , jump a gun tail , and land close to the mule .
`` It 's disgraceful , '' he say , blow out his nostril .
`` Those camel have racket through our line again -- the third time this week .
How 's a horse to keep his condition if he be n't allow to sleep .
Who 's here ? ''
`` I 'm the breech-piece mule of number two gun of the First Screw Battery , '' say the mule , `` and the other 's one of your friend .
He 's wake me up too .
Who be you ? ''
`` Number Fifteen , E troop , Ninth Lancers -- Dick Cunliffe 's horse .
Stand over a little , there . ''
`` Oh , beg your pardon , '' say the mule .
`` It 's too dark to see much .
Are n't these camel too sicken for anything ?
I walk out of my line to get a little peace and quiet here . ''
`` My lord , '' say the camel humbly , `` we dream bad dream in the night , and we be very much afraid .
I be only a baggage camel of the 39th Native Infantry , and I be not as brave a you be , my lord . ''
`` Then why do n't you stay and carry baggage for the 39th Native Infantry , instead of run all round the camp ? ''
say the mule .
`` They be such very bad dream , '' say the camel .
`` I be sorry .
Listen !
What be that ?
Shall we run on again ? ''
`` Sit down , '' say the mule , `` or you 'll snap your long stick-legs between the gun . ''
He cock one ear and listen .
`` Bullocks ! ''
he say .
`` Gun bullock .
On my word , you and your friend have wake the camp very thoroughly .
It take a good deal of prod to put up a gun-bullock . ''
I hear a chain drag along the ground , and a yoke of the great sulky white bullock that drag the heavy siege gun when the elephant wo n't go any nearer to the firing , come shoulder along together .
And almost step on the chain be another battery mule , call wildly for `` Billy . ''
`` That 's one of our recruit , '' say the old mule to the troop horse .
`` He 's call for me .
Here , youngster , stop squealing .
The dark never hurt anybody yet . ''
The gun-bullocks lay down together and begin chew the cud , but the young mule huddle close to Billy .
`` Things ! ''
he say .
`` Fearful and horrible , Billy !
They come into our line while we be asleep .
D'you think they 'll kill u ? ''
`` I 've a very great mind to give you a number-one kicking , '' say Billy .
`` The idea of a fourteen-hand mule with your train disgrace the battery before this gentleman ! ''
`` Gently , gently ! ''
say the troop-horse .
`` Remember they be always like this to begin with .
The first time I ever saw a man -LRB- it be in Australia when I be a three-year-old -RRB- I run for half a day , and if I 'd see a camel , I should have be run still . ''
Nearly all our horse for the English cavalry be bring to India from Australia , and be break in by the trooper themselves .
`` True enough , '' say Billy .
`` Stop shaking , youngster .
The first time they put the full harness with all it chain on my back I stand on my foreleg and kick every bit of it off .
I have n't learn the real science of kick then , but the battery say they have never see anything like it . ''
`` But this be n't harness or anything that jingle , '' say the young mule .
`` You know I do n't mind that now , Billy .
It be Things like tree , and they fell up and down the line and bubble ; and my head-rope broke , and I could n't find my driver , and I could n't find you , Billy , so I run off with -- with these gentleman . ''
`` H 'm ! ''
say Billy .
`` As soon a I hear the camel be loose I come away on my own account .
When a battery -- a screw-gun mule call gun-bullocks gentleman , he must be very badly shake up .
Who be you fellows on the ground there ? ''
The gun bullock roll their cud , and answer both together : `` The seventh yoke of the first gun of the Big Gun Battery .
We be asleep when the camel come , but when we be trample on we get up and walk away .
It be well to lie quiet in the mud than to be disturb on good bedding .
We tell your friend here that there be nothing to be afraid of , but he know so much that he think otherwise .
Wah ! ''
They go on chewing .
`` That come of be afraid , '' say Billy .
`` You get laugh at by gun-bullocks .
I hope you like it , young un . ''
The young mule 's teeth snap , and I hear him say something about not be afraid of any beefy old bullock in the world .
But the bullock only click their horn together and go on chewing .
`` Now , do n't be angry after you 've be afraid .
That 's the bad kind of cowardice , '' say the troop-horse .
`` Anybody can be forgive for be scar in the night , I think , if they see thing they do n't understand .
We 've break out of our picket , again and again , four hundred and fifty of u , just because a new recruit get to tell tale of whip snake at home in Australia till we be scar to death of the loose end of our head-ropes . ''
`` That 's all very well in camp , '' say Billy .
`` I 'm not above stampede myself , for the fun of the thing , when I have n't be out for a day or two .
But what do you do on active service ? ''
`` Oh , that 's quite another set of new shoe , '' say the troop horse .
`` Dick Cunliffe 's on my back then , and drive his knee into me , and all I have to do be to watch where I be put my foot , and to keep my hind legs well under me , and be bridle-wise . ''
`` What 's bridle-wise ? ''
say the young mule .
`` By the Blue Gums of the Back Blocks , '' snort the troop-horse , `` do you mean to say that you be n't teach to be bridle-wise in your business ?
How can you do anything , unless you can spin round at once when the rein be press on your neck ?
It mean life or death to your man , and of course that 's life and death to you .
Get round with your hind leg under you the instant you feel the rein on your neck .
If you have n't room to swing round , rear up a little and come round on your hind leg .
That 's be bridle-wise . ''
`` We be n't teach that way , '' say Billy the mule stiffly .
`` We 're taught to obey the man at our head : step off when he say so , and step in when he say so .
I suppose it come to the same thing .
Now , with all this fine fancy business and rearing , which must be very bad for your hock , what do you do ? ''
`` That depend , '' say the troop-horse .
`` Generally I have to go in among a lot of yelling , hairy men with knife -- long shiny knife , bad than the farrier 's knife -- and I have to take care that Dick 's boot be just touch the next man 's boot without crush it .
I can see Dick 's lance to the right of my right eye , and I know I 'm safe .
I should n't care to be the man or horse that stand up to Dick and me when we 're in a hurry . ''
`` Do n't the knife hurt ? ''
say the young mule .
`` Well , I get one cut across the chest once , but that be n't Dick 's fault -- '' `` A lot I should have care whose fault it be , if it hurt ! ''
say the young mule .
`` You must , '' say the troop horse .
`` If you do n't trust your man , you may as well run away at once .
That 's what some of our horse do , and I do n't blame them .
As I be say , it be n't Dick 's fault .
The man be lie on the ground , and I stretch myself not to tread on him , and he slash up at me .
Next time I have to go over a man lie down I shall step on him -- hard . ''
`` H 'm ! ''
say Billy .
`` It sound very foolish .
Knives be dirty thing at any time .
The proper thing to do be to climb up a mountain with a well-balanced saddle , hang on by all four foot and your ear too , and creep and crawl and wriggle along , till you come out hundred of foot above anyone else on a ledge where there 's just room enough for your hoof .
Then you stand still and keep quiet -- never ask a man to hold your head , young un -- keep quiet while the gun be be put together , and then you watch the little poppy shell drop down into the tree-tops ever so far below . ''
`` Do n't you ever trip ? ''
say the troop-horse .
`` They say that when a mule trip you can split a hen 's ear , '' say Billy .
`` Now and again perhaps a badly pack saddle will upset a mule , but it 's very seldom .
I wish I could show you our business .
It 's beautiful .
Why , it take me three year to find out what the men be drive at .
The science of the thing be never to show up against the sky line , because , if you do , you may get fire at .
Remember that , young un .
Always keep hidden as much a possible , even if you have to go a mile out of your way .
I lead the battery when it come to that sort of climb . ''
`` Fired at without the chance of run into the people who be fire ! ''
say the troop-horse , think hard .
`` I could n't stand that .
I should want to charge -- with Dick . ''
`` Oh , no , you would n't .
You know that as soon a the gun be in position they 'll do all the charging .
That 's scientific and neat .
But knife -- pah ! ''
The baggage-camel have be bob his head to and fro for some time past , anxious to get a word in edgewise .
Then I hear him say , a he clear his throat , nervously : `` I -- I -- I have fight a little , but not in that climb way or that run way . ''
`` No .
Now you mention it , '' say Billy , `` you do n't look a though you be make for climb or run -- much .
Well , how be it , old Hay-bales ? ''
`` The proper way , '' say the camel .
`` We all sit down -- '' `` Oh , my crupper and breastplate ! ''
say the troop-horse under his breath .
`` Sat down ! ''
`` We sit down -- a hundred of u , '' the camel go on , `` in a big square , and the men pile our pack and saddle , outside the square , and they fire over our back , the men do , on all side of the square . ''
`` What sort of men ?
Any men that come along ? ''
say the troop-horse .
`` They teach u in rid school to lie down and let our master fire across u , but Dick Cunliffe be the only man I 'd trust to do that .
It tickle my girth , and , besides , I ca n't see with my head on the ground . ''
`` What do it matter who fire across you ? ''
say the camel .
`` There be plenty of men and plenty of other camel close by , and a great many cloud of smoke .
I be not frighten then .
I sit still and wait . ''
`` And yet , '' say Billy , `` you dream bad dream and upset the camp at night .
Well , well !
Before I 'd lie down , not to speak of sit down , and let a man fire across me , my heel and his head would have something to say to each other .
Did you ever hear anything so awful a that ? ''
There be a long silence , and then one of the gun bullock lift up his big head and say , `` This be very foolish indeed .
There be only one way of fight . ''
`` Oh , go on , '' say Billy .
`` Please do n't mind me .
I suppose you fellows fight stand on your tail ? ''
`` Only one way , '' say the two together .
-LRB- They must have be twin . -RRB-
`` This be that way .
To put all twenty yoke of u to the big gun as soon a Two Tails trumpet . ''
-LRB- `` Two Tails '' be camp slang for the elephant . -RRB-
`` What do Two Tails trumpet for ? ''
say the young mule .
`` To show that he be not go any nearer to the smoke on the other side .
Two Tails be a great coward .
Then we tug the big gun all together -- Heya -- Hullah !
Heeyah !
Hullah !
We do not climb like cat nor run like calf .
We go across the level plain , twenty yoke of u , till we be unyoked again , and we graze while the big gun talk across the plain to some town with mud wall , and piece of the wall fall out , and the dust go up a though many cattle be come home . ''
`` Oh !
And you choose that time for graze ? ''
say the young mule .
`` That time or any other .
Eating be always good .
We eat till we be yoke up again and tug the gun back to where Two Tails be wait for it .
Sometimes there be big gun in the city that speak back , and some of u be kill , and then there be all the more grazing for those that be leave .
This be Fate .
None the less , Two Tails be a great coward .
That be the proper way to fight .
We be brother from Hapur .
Our father be a sacred bull of Shiva .
We have speak . ''
`` Well , I 've certainly learn something tonight , '' say the troop-horse .
`` Do you gentleman of the screw-gun battery feel incline to eat when you be be fire at with big gun , and Two Tails be behind you ? ''
`` About as much a we feel inclined to sit down and let men sprawl all over u , or run into people with knife .
I never hear such stuff .
A mountain ledge , a well-balanced load , a driver you can trust to let you pick your own way , and I 'm your mule .
But -- the other thing -- no ! ''
say Billy , with a stamp of his foot .
`` Of course , '' say the troop horse , `` everyone be not make in the same way , and I can quite see that your family , on your father 's side , would fail to understand a great many thing . ''
`` Never you mind my family on my father 's side , '' say Billy angrily , for every mule hat to be remind that his father be a donkey .
`` My father be a Southern gentleman , and he could pull down and bite and kick into rags every horse he come across .
Remember that , you big brown Brumby ! ''
Brumby mean wild horse without any breeding .
Imagine the feeling of Sunol if a car-horse call her a `` skate , '' and you can imagine how the Australian horse felt .
I saw the white of his eye glitter in the dark .
`` See here , you son of an import Malaga jackass , '' he say between his teeth , `` I 'd have you know that I 'm relate on my mother 's side to Carbine , winner of the Melbourne Cup , and where I come from we be n't accustom to be ride over roughshod by any parrot-mouthed , pig-headed mule in a pop-gun pea-shooter battery .
Are you ready ? ''
`` On your hind leg ! ''
squeal Billy .
They both rear up face each other , and I be expect a furious fight , when a gurgly , rumbly voice , call out of the darkness to the right -- `` Children , what be you fight about there ?
Be quiet . ''
Both beast drop down with a snort of disgust , for neither horse nor mule can bear to listen to an elephant 's voice .
`` It 's Two Tails ! ''
say the troop-horse .
`` I ca n't stand him .
A tail at each end be n't fair ! ''
`` My feeling exactly , '' say Billy , crowd into the troop-horse for company .
`` We 're very alike in some thing . ''
`` I suppose we 've inherit them from our mother , '' say the troop horse .
`` It 's not worth quarrel about .
Hi !
Two Tails , be you tie up ? ''
`` Yes , '' say Two Tails , with a laugh all up his trunk .
`` I 'm picket for the night .
I 've hear what you fellows have be say .
But do n't be afraid .
I 'm not come over . ''
The bullock and the camel say , half aloud , `` Afraid of Two Tails -- what nonsense ! ''
And the bullock go on , `` We be sorry that you hear , but it be true .
Two Tails , why be you afraid of the gun when they fire ? ''
`` Well , '' say Two Tails , rub one hind leg against the other , exactly like a little boy say a poem , `` I do n't quite know whether you 'd understand . ''
`` We do n't , but we have to pull the gun , '' say the bullock .
`` I know it , and I know you be a good deal braver than you think you be .
But it 's different with me .
My battery captain call me a Pachydermatous Anachronism the other day . ''
`` That 's another way of fighting , I suppose ? ''
say Billy , who be recover his spirit .
`` You do n't know what that mean , of course , but I do .
It mean betwixt and between , and that be just where I be .
I can see inside my head what will happen when a shell burst , and you bullock ca n't . ''
`` I can , '' say the troop-horse .
`` At least a little bit .
I try not to think about it . ''
`` I can see more than you , and I do think about it .
I know there 's a great deal of me to take care of , and I know that nobody know how to cure me when I 'm sick .
All they can do be to stop my driver 's pay till I get well , and I ca n't trust my driver . ''
`` Ah ! ''
say the troop horse .
`` That explain it .
I can trust Dick . ''
`` You could put a whole regiment of Dicks on my back without make me feel any good .
I know just enough to be uncomfortable , and not enough to go on in spite of it . ''
`` We do not understand , '' say the bullock .
`` I know you do n't .
I 'm not talk to you .
You do n't know what blood be . ''
`` We do , '' say the bullock .
`` It be red stuff that soak into the ground and smell . ''
The troop-horse give a kick and a bound and a snort .
`` Do n't talk of it , '' he say .
`` I can smell it now , just thinking of it .
It make me want to run -- when I have n't Dick on my back . ''
`` But it be not here , '' say the camel and the bullock .
`` Why be you so stupid ? ''
`` It 's vile stuff , '' say Billy .
`` I do n't want to run , but I do n't want to talk about it . ''
`` There you be ! ''
say Two Tails , wave his tail to explain .
`` Surely .
Yes , we have be here all night , '' say the bullock .
Two Tails stamp his foot till the iron ring on it jingle .
`` Oh , I 'm not talk to you .
You ca n't see inside your head . ''
`` No .
We see out of our four eye , '' say the bullock .
`` We see straight in front of u . ''
`` If I could do that and nothing else , you would n't be need to pull the big gun at all .
If I be like my captain -- he can see thing inside his head before the firing begin , and he shake all over , but he know too much to run away -- if I be like him I could pull the gun .
But if I be as wise a all that I should never be here .
I should be a king in the forest , a I use to be , sleep half the day and bathing when I like .
I have n't have a good bath for a month . ''
`` That 's all very fine , '' say Billy .
`` But give a thing a long name do n't make it any good . ''
`` H'sh ! ''
say the troop horse .
`` I think I understand what Two Tails mean . ''
`` You 'll understand well in a minute , '' say Two Tails angrily .
`` Now you just explain to me why you do n't like this ! ''
He begin trumpet furiously at the top of his trumpet .
`` Stop that ! ''
say Billy and the troop horse together , and I could hear them stamp and shiver .
An elephant 's trumpeting be always nasty , especially on a dark night .
`` I sha n't stop , '' say Two Tails .
`` Wo n't you explain that , please ?
Hhrrmph !
Rrrt !
Rrrmph !
Rrrhha ! ''
Then he stop suddenly , and I hear a little whimper in the dark , and know that Vixen have find me at last .
She know as well a I do that if there be one thing in the world the elephant be more afraid of than another it be a little barking dog .
So she stop to bully Two Tails in his picket , and yap round his big foot .
Two Tails shuffle and squeak .
`` Go away , little dog ! ''
he say .
`` Do n't snuff at my ankle , or I 'll kick at you .
Good little dog -- nice little doggie , then !
Go home , you yelp little beast !
Oh , why do n't someone take her away ?
She 'll bite me in a minute . ''
`` Seems to me , '' say Billy to the troop horse , `` that our friend Two Tails be afraid of most thing .
Now , if I have a full meal for every dog I 've kick across the parade-ground I should be as fat a Two Tails nearly . ''
I whistle , and Vixen run up to me , muddy all over , and lick my nose , and tell me a long tale about hunt for me all through the camp .
I never let her know that I understand beast talk , or she would have take all sort of liberty .
So I button her into the breast of my overcoat , and Two Tails shuffle and stamp and growl to himself .
`` Extraordinary !
Most extraordinary ! ''
he say .
`` It run in our family .
Now , where have that nasty little beast go to ? ''
I hear him feel about with his trunk .
`` We all seem to be affect in various way , '' he go on , blow his nose .
`` Now , you gentlemen be alarm , I believe , when I trumpet . ''
`` Not alarm , exactly , '' say the troop-horse , `` but it make me feel a though I have hornet where my saddle ought to be .
Do n't begin again . ''
`` I 'm frightened of a little dog , and the camel here be frighten by bad dream in the night . ''
`` It be very lucky for u that we have n't all get to fight in the same way , '' say the troop-horse .
`` What I want to know , '' say the young mule , who have be quiet for a long time -- `` what I want to know be , why we have to fight at all . ''
`` Because we 're tell to , '' say the troop-horse , with a snort of contempt .
`` Orders , '' say Billy the mule , and his teeth snap .
`` Hukm hai ! ''
-LRB- It be an order ! -RRB-
, say the camel with a gurgle , and Two Tails and the bullock repeat , `` Hukm hai ! ''
`` Yes , but who give the order ? ''
say the recruit-mule .
`` The man who walk at your head -- Or sits on your back -- Or hold the nose rope -- Or twist your tail , '' say Billy and the troop-horse and the camel and the bullock one after the other .
`` But who give them the order ? ''
`` Now you want to know too much , young un , '' say Billy , `` and that be one way of get kick .
All you have to do be to obey the man at your head and ask no question . ''
`` He 's quite right , '' say Two Tails .
`` I ca n't always obey , because I 'm betwixt and between .
But Billy 's right .
Obey the man next to you who give the order , or you 'll stop all the battery , besides get a thrashing . ''
The gun-bullocks get up to go .
`` Morning be come , '' they say .
`` We will go back to our line .
It be true that we only see out of our eye , and we be not very clever .
But still , we be the only people to-night who have not be afraid .
Good-night , you brave people . ''
Nobody answer , and the troop-horse say , to change the conversation , `` Where 's that little dog ?
A dog mean a man somewhere about . ''
`` Here I be , '' yap Vixen , `` under the gun tail with my man .
You big , blunder beast of a camel you , you upset our tent .
My man 's very angry . ''
`` Phew ! ''
say the bullock .
`` He must be white ! ''
`` Of course he be , '' say Vixen .
`` Do you suppose I 'm looked after by a black bullock-driver ? ''
`` Huah !
Ouach !
Ugh ! ''
say the bullock .
`` Let u get away quickly . ''
They plunge forward in the mud , and manage somehow to run their yoke on the pole of an ammunition wagon , where it jam .
`` Now you have do it , '' say Billy calmly .
`` Do n't struggle .
You 're hang up till daylight .
What on earth 's the matter ? ''
The bullock go off into the long hissing snort that Indian cattle give , and push and crowd and slue and stamp and slip and nearly fell down in the mud , grunt savagely .
`` You 'll break your neck in a minute , '' say the troop-horse .
`` What 's the matter with white men ?
I live with 'em . ''
`` They -- eat -- u !
Pull ! ''
say the near bullock .
The yoke snap with a twang , and they lumber off together .
I never know before what make Indian cattle so scared of Englishmen .
We eat beef -- a thing that no cattle-driver touch -- and of course the cattle do not like it .
`` May I be flog with my own pad-chains !
Who 'd have think of two big lump like those lose their head ? ''
say Billy .
`` Never mind .
I 'm go to look at this man .
Most of the white men , I know , have thing in their pocket , '' say the troop-horse .
`` I 'll leave you , then .
I ca n't say I 'm over-fond of 'em myself .
Besides , white men who have n't a place to sleep in be more than likely to be thief , and I 've a good deal of Government property on my back .
Come along , young un , and we 'll go back to our line .
Good-night , Australia !
See you on parade to-morrow , I suppose .
Good-night , old Hay-bale !
-- try to control your feeling , wo n't you ?
Good-night , Two Tails !
If you pass u on the ground tomorrow , do n't trumpet .
It spoil our formation . ''
Billy the Mule stump off with the swagger limp of an old campaigner , a the troop-horse 's head come nuzzle into my breast , and I give him biscuit , while Vixen , who be a most conceited little dog , tell him fib about the score of horse that she and I keep .
`` I 'm come to the parade to-morrow in my dog-cart , '' she say .
`` Where will you be ? ''
`` On the left hand of the second squadron .
I set the time for all my troop , little lady , '' he say politely .
`` Now I must go back to Dick .
My tail 's all muddy , and he 'll have two hour ' hard work dress me for parade . ''
The big parade of all the thirty thousand men be hold that afternoon , and Vixen and I have a good place close to the Viceroy and the Amir of Afghanistan , with high , big black hat of astrakhan wool and the great diamond star in the center .
The first part of the review be all sunshine , and the regiment go by in wave upon wave of leg all move together , and gun all in a line , till our eye grow dizzy .
Then the cavalry come up , to the beautiful cavalry canter of `` Bonnie Dundee , '' and Vixen cock her ear where she sit on the dog-cart .
The second squadron of the Lancers shot by , and there be the troop-horse , with his tail like spun silk , his head pull into his breast , one ear forward and one back , set the time for all his squadron , his legs go as smoothly a waltz music .
Then the big gun come by , and I saw Two Tails and two other elephant harness in line to a forty-pounder siege gun , while twenty yoke of ox walk behind .
The seventh pair have a new yoke , and they look rather stiff and tired .
Last come the screw gun , and Billy the mule carry himself a though he command all the troop , and his harness be oil and polish till it wink .
I give a cheer all by myself for Billy the mule , but he never look right or leave .
The rain begin to fall again , and for a while it be too misty to see what the troop be do .
They have make a big half circle across the plain , and be spread out into a line .
That line grow and grow and grow till it be three-quarters of a mile long from wing to wing -- one solid wall of men , horse , and gun .
Then it come on straight toward the Viceroy and the Amir , and a it get nearer the ground begin to shake , like the deck of a steamer when the engine be go fast .
Unless you have be there you can not imagine what a frightening effect this steady come-down of troop have on the spectator , even when they know it be only a review .
I look at the Amir .
Up till then he have not show the shadow of a sign of astonishment or anything else .
But now his eye begin to get big and big , and he pick up the rein on his horse 's neck and look behind him .
For a minute it seem a though he be go to draw his sword and slash his way out through the English men and woman in the carriage at the back .
Then the advance stop dead , the ground stand still , the whole line salute , and thirty band begin to play all together .
That be the end of the review , and the regiment go off to their camp in the rain , and an infantry band strike up with -- The animal go in two by two , Hurrah !
The animal go in two by two , The elephant and the battery mul ' , and they all get into the Ark For to get out of the rain !
Then I hear an old grizzled , long-haired Central Asian chief , who have come down with the Amir , ask question of a native officer .
`` Now , '' say he , `` in what manner be this wonderful thing do ? ''
And the officer answer , `` An order be give , and they obey . ''
`` But be the beast as wise a the men ? ''
say the chief .
`` They obey , a the men do .
Mule , horse , elephant , or bullock , he obey his driver , and the driver his sergeant , and the sergeant his lieutenant , and the lieutenant his captain , and the captain his major , and the major his colonel , and the colonel his brigadier command three regiment , and the brigadier the general , who obey the Viceroy , who be the servant of the Empress .
Thus it be do . ''
`` Would it be so in Afghanistan ! ''
say the chief , `` for there we obey only our own will . ''
`` And for that reason , '' say the native officer , twirl his mustache , `` your Amir whom you do not obey must come here and take order from our Viceroy . ''
Parade Song of the Camp Animals ELEPHANTS OF THE GUN TEAMS We lend to Alexander the strength of Hercules , The wisdom of our forehead , the cunning of our knee ; We bow our neck to service : they ne'er be loose again , -- Make way there -- way for the ten-foot team Of the Forty-Pounder train !
GUN BULLOCKS Those hero in their harness avoid a cannon-ball , And what they know of powder upset them one and all ; Then we come into action and tug the gun again -- Make way there -- way for the twenty yoke Of the Forty-Pounder train !
CAVALRY HORSES By the brand on my shoulder , the fine of tune Is play by the Lancers , Hussars , and Dragoons , And it 's sweet than `` Stables '' or `` Water '' to me -- The Cavalry Canter of `` Bonnie Dundee '' !
Then fee u and break u and handle and groom , And give u good rider and plenty of room , And launch u in column of squadron and see The way of the war-horse to `` Bonnie Dundee '' !
SCREW-GUN MULES As me and my companion be scramble up a hill , The path be lose in roll stone , but we go forward still ; For we can wriggle and climb , my lad , and turn up everywhere , Oh , it 's our delight on a mountain height , with a leg or two to spare !
Good luck to every sergeant , then , that let u pick our road ; Bad luck to all the driver-men that can not pack a load : For we can wriggle and climb , my lad , and turn up everywhere , Oh , it 's our delight on a mountain height , with a leg or two to spare !
COMMISSARIAT CAMELS We have n't a camelty tune of our own To help u trollop along , But every neck be a hair trombone -LRB- Rtt-ta-ta-ta !

And this our marching-song : Ca n't !
Do n't !
Sha n't !
Wo n't !
Pass it along the line !
Somebody 's pack have slide from his back , Wish it be only mine !
Somebody 's load have tip off in the road -- Cheer for a halt and a row !
Urrr !
Yarrh !
Grr !
Arrh !
Somebody 's catch it now !
ALL THE BEASTS TOGETHER Children of the Camp be we , Serving each in his degree ; Children of the yoke and goad , Pack and harness , pad and load .
See our line across the plain , Like a heel-rope bent again , Reaching , writhing , roll far , Sweeping all away to war !
While the men that walk beside , Dusty , silent , heavy-eyed , Can not tell why we or they March and suffer day by day .

I JIMMY SKUNK IS PUZZLED Old Mother West Wind have just come down from the Purple Hills and turn loose her child , the Merry Little Breezes , from the big bag in which she have be carry them .
They be very lively and very merry a they dance and race across the Green Meadows in all direction , for it be good to be back there once more .
Old Mother West Wind almost sigh a she watch them for a few minute .
She felt that she would like to join them .
Always the springtime make her feel this way , -- young , mad , carefree , and happy .
But she have work to do .
She have to turn the windmill to pump water for Farmer Brown 's cow , and this be only one of many mill stand idle a they wait for her .
So she puff her cheek out and start about her business .
Jimmy Skunk sit at the top of the hill that overlook the Green Meadows and watch her out of sight .
Then he start to amble down the Lone Little Path to look for some beetle .
He be amble along in his lazy way , for you know he never hurry , when he hear some one puffing and blow behind him .
Of course he turn to see who it be , and he be greatly surprised when he discover Old Mr. Toad .
Yes , Sir , it be Old Mr. Toad , and he seem in a great hurry .
He be quite short of breath , but he be hop along in the most determined way a if he be in a great hurry to get somewhere .
Now it be a very unusual thing for Mr. Toad to hurry , very unusual indeed .
As a rule he hop a few step and then sit down to think it over .
Jimmy have never before see him hop more than a few step unless he be try to get away from danger , from Mr. Blacksnake for instance .
Of course the first thing Jimmy thought of be Mr. Blacksnake , and he look for him .
But there be no sign of Mr. Blacksnake nor of any other danger .
Then he look very hard at Old Mr. Toad , and he saw right away that Old Mr. Toad do n't seem to be frighten at all , only very determined , and a if he have something important on his mind .
`` Well , well , '' exclaim Jimmy Skunk , `` whatever have get into those long hind leg of yours to make them work so fast ? ''
Old Mr. Toad do n't say a word , but simply try to get past Jimmy and keep on his way .
Jimmy put out one hand and turn Old Mr. Toad right over on his back , where he kick and struggle in an effort to get on his foot again , and look very ridiculous .
`` Do n't you know that it be n't polite not to speak when you be speak to ? ''
demand Jimmy severely , though his eye twinkle .
`` I -- I beg your pardon .
I do n't have any breath to spare , '' pant Old Mr. Toad .
`` You see I 'm in a great hurry . ''
`` Yes , I see , '' reply Jimmy .
`` But do n't you know that it be n't good for the health to hurry so ?
Now , pray , what be you in such a hurry for ?
I do n't see anything to run away from . ''
`` I 'm not run away , '' retort Old Mr. Toad indignantly .
`` I 've business to attend to at the Smiling Pool , and I 'm late a it be . ''
`` Business ! ''
exclaim Jimmy a if he could hardly believe his ear .
`` What business have you at the Smiling Pool ? ''
`` That be my own affair , '' retort Old Mr. Toad , `` but if you really want to know , I 'll tell you .
I have a very important part in the spring chorus , and I 'm go down there to sing .
I have a very beautiful voice . ''
That be too much for Jimmy Skunk .
He just lay down and roll over and over with laughter .
The idea of any one so homely , almost ugly-looking , a Mr. Toad think that he have a beautiful voice !
`` Ha , ha , ha !
Ho , ho , ho ! ''
roar Jimmy .
When at last he stop because he could n't laugh any more , he discover that Old Mr. Toad be on his way again .
Hop , hop , hipperty-hop , hop , hop , hipperty-hop go Mr. Toad .
Jimmy watch him , and he confess that he be puzzle .
II JIMMY SKUNK CONSULTS HIS FRIENDS Jimmy Skunk scratch his head thoughtfully a he watch Old Mr. Toad go down the Lone Little Path , hop , hop , hipperty-hop , towards the Smiling Pool .
He certainly be puzzle , be Jimmy Skunk .
If Old Mr. Toad have tell him that he could fly , Jimmy would not have be more surprised , or find it hard to believe than that Old Mr. Toad have a beautiful voice .
The truth be , Jimmy do n't believe it .
He think that Old Mr. Toad be try to fool him .
Presently Peter Rabbit come along .
He find Jimmy Skunk sit in a brown study .
He have quite forget to look for fat beetle , and when he forget to do that you may make up your mind that Jimmy be do some hard thinking .
`` Hello , old Striped-coat , what have you get on your mind this fine morning ? ''
cry Peter Rabbit .
`` Him , '' say Jimmy simply , point down the Lone Little Path .
Peter look .
`` Do you mean Old Mr. Toad ! ''
he ask .
Jimmy nod .
`` Do you see anything queer about him ? ''
he ask in his turn .
-LSB- Illustration : `` Do you see anything queer about him ? ''
he ask . -RSB-
Peter star down the Lone Little Path .
`` No , '' he reply , `` except that he seem in a great hurry . ''
`` That 's just it , '' Jimmy return promptly .
`` Did you ever see him hurry unless he be frighten ? ''
Peter confess that he never have .
`` Well , he be n't frighten now , yet just look at him go , '' retort Jimmy .
`` Says he have get a beautiful voice , and that he have to take part in the spring chorus at the Smiling Pool and that he be late . ''
Peter look very hard at Jimmy to see if he be fool or tell the truth .
Then he begin to laugh .
`` Old Mr. Toad sing !
The very idea ! ''
he cry .
`` He can sing about as much a I can , and that be not at all . ''
Jimmy grin .
`` I think he 's crazy , if you ask me , '' say he .
`` And yet he be just a earnest about it a if it be really so .
I think he must have eat something that have go to his head .
There 's Unc ' Billy Possum over there .
Let 's ask him what he think . ''
So Jimmy and Peter join Unc ' Billy , and Jimmy tell the story about Old Mr. Toad all over again .
Unc ' Billy chuckle and laugh just a they have at the idea of Old Mr. Toad 's say he have a beautiful voice .
But Unc ' Billy have a shrewd little head on his shoulder .
After a few minute he stop laugh .
`` Ah do learn a right smart long time ago that Ah don ' know all there be to know about mah neighbor , '' say he .
`` We-uns do think of Brer Toad a ugly-lookin ' fo ' so long that we-uns may have overlook something .
Ah don ' reckon Brer Toad can sing , but Ah ` low that perhaps he think he can .
What do you-alls say to we-uns go down to the Smiling Pool and find out what he really be up to ? ''
`` The very thing ! ''
cry Peter , kick up his heel .
You know Peter be always ready to go anywhere or do anything that will satisfy his curiosity .
Jimmy Skunk think it over for a few minute , and then he decide that a he have n't anything in particular to do , and a he might find some fat beetle on the way , he would go too .
So off they start after Old Mr. Toad , Peter Rabbit in the lead a usual , Unc ' Billy Possum next , grin a only he can grin , and in the rear Jimmy Skunk , take his time and keep a sharp eye out for fat beetle .
III THE HUNT FOR OLD MR. TOAD Now , though Old Mr. Toad be hurry as fast a ever he could and be quite out of breath , he be n't get along very fast compare with the way Peter Rabbit or Jimmy Skunk or Unc ' Billy Possum could cover the ground .
You see he can not make long jump like his cousin , Grandfather Frog , but only little short hop .
So Peter and Jimmy and Unc ' Billy take their time about follow him .
They stop to hunt for fat beetle for Jimmy Skunk , and at every little patch of sweet clover for Peter Rabbit to help himself .
Once they waste a lot of time while Unc ' Billy Possum hunt for a nest of Carol the Meadow Lark , on the chance that he would find some fresh egg there .
He do n't find the nest for the very good reason that Carol have n't build one yet .
Peter be secretly glad .
You know he do n't eat egg , and he be always sorry for his feathered friend when their egg be steal .
Half way across the Green Meadows they stop to play with the Merry Little Breezes , and because it be very pleasant there , they play long than they realize .
When at last they start on again , Old Mr. Toad be out of sight .
You see all the time he have keep right on go , hop , hop , hipperty-hop .
`` Never mind , '' say Peter , `` we can catch up with him easy enough , he 's such a slow-poke . ''
But even a slow-poke who keep right on do a thing without waste any time always get somewhere sooner or later , very often sooner than those who be naturally quicker , but who waste their time .
So it be with Old Mr. Toad .
He keep right on , hop , hop , hipperty-hop , while the others be play , and so it happen that when at last Peter and Jimmy and Unc ' Billy reach the Smiling Pool , they have n't catch another glimpse of Old Mr. Toad .
`` Do you suppose he hide somewhere , and we pass him ? ''
ask Peter .
Unc ' Billy shake his head .
`` Ah don ' reckon so , '' say he .
`` We-uns do be foolin ' away our time , an ' Brer Toad do stole a march on u .
Ah reckons we-uns will find him sittin ' on the bank here somewhere . ''
So right away the three separate to look for Old Mr. Toad .
All along the bank of the Smiling Pool they look .
They peep under old leaf and stick .
They look in every place where Old Mr. Toad might have hide , but not a trace of him do they find .
`` Tra-la-la-lee !
Oka-chee !
Oka-chee !
Happy be I a I can be ! ''
sang Mr. Redwing , a he sway to and fro among the bulrush .
`` Say , Mr. Redwing , have you see Old Mr. Toad ? ''
call Peter Rabbit .
`` No , '' reply Mr. Redwing .
`` Is that whom you fellows be look for ?
I wonder if you have lose something .
What do you want with Old Mr. Toad ? ''
Peter explain how they have follow Old Mr. Toad just to see what he really be up to .
`` Of course we know that he have n't any more voice than I have , '' declare Peter , `` but we be curious to know if he really think he have , and why he should be in such a hurry to reach the Smiling Pool .
It look to u a if the spring have make Old Mr. Toad crazy . ''
`` Oh , that 's it , be it ? ''
reply Mr. Redwing , his bright eye twinkle .
`` Some people do n't know as much a they might .
I 've be wonder where Old Mr. Toad be , and I 'm ever so glad to learn that he have n't forget that he have a very important part in our beautiful spring chorus . ''
Then once more Mr. Redwing begin to sing .
IV PETER RABBIT FINDS OLD MR. TOAD It be n't often that Peter Rabbit be truly envious , but sometimes in the joyousness of spring he be .
He envy the bird because they can pour out in beautiful song the joy that be in them .
The only way he can express his feeling be by kick his long heel , jump about , and such foolish thing .
While that give Peter a great deal of satisfaction , it do n't add to the joy of other people a do the song of the bird , and you know to give joy to others be to add to your own joy .
So there be time when Peter wish he could sing .
He be wish this very thing now , a he sit on the bank of the Smiling Pool , listen to the great spring chorus .
`` Tra-la-la-lee !
Oka-chee !
Oka-chee !
There 's joy in the spring for you and for me . ''
sang Redwing the Blackbird from the bulrush .
From over in the Green Meadows rise the clear lilt of Carol the Meadow Lark , and among the alder just where the Laughing Brook run into the Smiling Pool a flood of happiness be pour from the throat of Little Friend the Song Sparrow .
Winsome Bluebird 's sweet , almost plaintive , whistle seem to fairly float in the air , so that it be hard to say just where it do come from , and in the top of the Big Hickory-tree , Welcome Robin be sing a if his heart be burst with joy .
Even Sammy Jay be add a beautiful , bell-like note instead of his usual harsh scream .
As for the Smiling Pool , it seem a if the very water itself sing , for a mighty chorus of clear pip voice from unseen singer rise from all around it bank .
Peter know who those singer be , although look a he would he could see none of them .
They be hyla , the tiny cousin of Stickytoes the Tree Toad .
Listening to all these joyous voice , Peter forget for a time what have bring him to the Smiling Pool .
But Jimmy Skunk and Unc ' Billy Possum do n't forget .
They be still hunt for Old Mr. Toad .
`` Well , old Mr. Dreamer , have you find him yet ? ''
ask Jimmy Skunk , steal up behind Peter and poke him in the back .
Peter come to himself with a start .
`` No , '' say he .
`` I be just listen and wish that I could sing , too .
Do n't you ever wish you could sing , Jimmy ? ''
`` No , '' reply Jimmy .
`` I never waste time wishing I could do thing it be never mean I should do .
It 's funny where Old Mr. Toad be .
He say that he be come down here to sing , and Redwing the Blackbird seem to be expect him .
I 've look everywhere I can think of without find him , but I do n't believe in give up without another try .
Stop your dreaming and come help u hunt . ''
So Peter stop his dreaming and join in the search .
Now there be one place where neither Peter nor Jimmy nor Unc ' Billy have think of look .
That be in the Smiling Pool itself .
They just take it for grant that Old Mr. Toad be somewhere on the bank .
Presently Peter come to a place where the bank be very low and the water be shallow for quite a little distance out in the Smiling Pool .
From out of that shallow water come the piping voice of a hyla , and Peter stop to stare , try to see the tiny singer .
Suddenly he jump right up in the air with surprise .
There be a familiar-looking head stick out of the water .
Peter have find Old Mr. Toad !
V OLD MR. TOAD 'S MUSIC BAG Never think that you have learn All there be to know .
That 's the sure way of all Ignorance to show .
`` I 've find Old Mr. Toad ! ''
cry Peter Rabbit , hurry after Jimmy Skunk .
`` Where ? ''
demand Jimmy .
`` In the water , '' declare Peter .
`` He 's sit right over there where the water be shallow , and he do n't notice me at all .
Let 's get Unc ' Billy , and then creep over to the edge of the Smiling Pool and watch to see if Old Mr. Toad really do try to sing . ''
So they hunt up Unc ' Billy Possum , and the three stole very softly over to the edge of the Smiling Pool , where the bank be low and the water shallow .
Sure enough , there sit Old Mr. Toad with just his head out of water .
And while they be watch him , something very strange happen .
`` What -- what 's the matter with him ? ''
whispered Peter , his big eye look a if they might pop out of his head .
`` If he do n't watch out , he 'll blow up and bust ! ''
exclaim Jimmy .
-LSB- Illustration : `` If he do n't watch out , he 'll blow up and bust ! ''
exclaim Jimmy . -RSB-
`` Listen ! ''
whisper Unc ' Billy Possum .
`` Do mah ol ' ear hear right ?
` Pears to me that that song be come right from where Brer Toad be sit . ''
It certainly do appear so , and of all the song that glad spring day there be none sweeter .
Indeed there be few a sweet .
The only trouble be the song be so very short .
It last only for two or three second .
And when it end , Old Mr. Toad look quite his natural self again ; just a commonplace , almost ugly , a ever .
Peter look at Jimmy Skunk , Jimmy look at Unc ' Billy Possum , and Unc ' Billy look at Peter .
And no one have a word to say .
Then all three look back at Old Mr. Toad .
And even a they look , his throat begin to swell and swell and swell , until it be no wonder that Jimmy Skunk have think that he be in danger of blow up .
And then , when it stop swell , there come again those beautiful little note , so sweet and tremulous that Peter actually hold his breath to listen .
There be no doubt that Old Mr. Toad be sing just a he have say he be go to , and it be just a true that his song be one of the sweet if not the sweet of all the chorus from and around the Smiling Pool .
It be very hard to believe , but Peter and Jimmy and Unc ' Billy both saw and heard , and that be enough .
Their respect for Old Mr. Toad grow tremendously a they listen .
`` How do he do it ? ''
whisper Peter .
`` With that bag under his chin , of course , '' reply Jimmy Skunk .
`` Do n't you see it 's only when that be swell out that he sing ?
It 's a regular music bag .
And I do n't know he have any such bag there at all . ''
`` I wish , '' say Peter Rabbit , feeling of his throat , `` that I have a music bag like that in my throat . ''
And then he join in the laugh of Jimmy and Unc ' Billy , but still with something of a look of wistfulness in his eye .
VI PETER DISCOVERS SOMETHING MORE There be strange thing in the world to-day Than ever you dream could be .
There 's beauty in some of the common thing If only you 've eye to see .
Ever since Peter Rabbit be a little chap and have first run away from home , he have know Old Mr. Toad , and never once have Peter suspect that he could sing .
Also he have think Old Mr. Toad almost ugly-looking , and he know that most of his neighbor think the same way .
They be fond of Old Mr. Toad , for he be always good-natured and attend strictly to his own affair ; but they like to poke fun at him , and a for there be anything beautiful about him , such a thing never enter their head .
Now that they have discover that he really have a very beautiful voice , they begin to look on him with a great deal more respect .
This be especially so with Peter .
He get in the habit of go over to the Smiling Pool every day , when the way be clear , just to sit on the bank and listen to Old Mr. Toad .
`` Why do n't you ever tell u before that you could sing ? ''
he ask one day , a Old Mr. Toad look up at him from the Smiling Pool .
`` What be the use of waste my breath ? ''
demand Old Mr. Toad .
`` You would n't have believe me if I have .
You do n't believe me when I do tell you . ''
Peter know that this be true , and he could n't find any answer ready .
At last he venture another question .
`` Why have n't I ever hear you sing before ? ''
`` You have , '' reply Old Mr. Toad tartly .
`` I sing right in this very place last spring , and the spring before , and the spring before that .
You 've sit on that very bank lot of time while I be sing .
The trouble with you , Peter , be that you do n't use your eye or your ear . ''
Peter look more foolish than ever .
But he venture another question .
It would n't be Peter to let a chance for question go by .
`` Have I ever hear you sing up on the meadow or in the Old Orchard ? ''
`` No , '' reply Old Mr. Toad , `` I only sing in the springtime .
That 's the time for singing .
I just have to sing then .
In the summer it be too hot , and in the winter I sleep .
I always return to my old home to sing .
You know I be bear here .
All my family gather here in the spring to sing , so of course I come too . ''
Old Mr. Toad fill out his queer music bag under his chin and begin to sing again .
Peter watch him .
Now it just happen that Old Mr. Toad be face him , and so Peter look down straight into his eye .
He never have look into Mr. Toad 's eye before , and now he just star and star , for it come over him that those eye be very beautiful , very beautiful indeed .
`` Oh ! ''
he exclaim , `` what beautiful eye you have , Mr. Toad ! ''
`` So I 've be tell before , '' reply Old Mr. Toad .
`` My family always have have beautiful eye .
There be an old saying that every Toad have jewel in his head , but of course he have n't , not real jewel .
It be just the beautiful eye .
Excuse me , Peter , but I 'm need in that chorus . ''
Old Mr. Toad once more swell out his throat and begin to sing .
Peter watch him a while longer , then hop away to the dear Old Briarpatch , and he be very thoughtful .
`` Never again will I call anybody homely and ugly until I know all about him , '' say Peter , which be a very wise decision .
Do n't you think so ?
VII A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE SMILING POOL Here 's what Mr. Toad say ; Heed it well , my dear : `` Time to watch for cloud be When the sky be clear . ''
He say that that be the reason that he live to a good old age , do Old Mr. Toad .
I suppose he mean that when the sky be cloudy , everybody be look for rain and be prepare for it , but when the sun be shin , most people forget that there be such a thing a a storm , so when it come suddenly very few be prepare for it .
It be the same way with danger and trouble .
So Old Mr. Toad very wisely watch out when there seem to be the least need of it , and he find it always pay .
It be a beautiful spring evening .
Over back of the Purple Hills to which Old Mother West Wind have take her child , the Merry Little Breezes , and behind which jolly , round , red Mr. Sun have go to bed , there be still a faint , clear light .
But over the Green Meadows and the Smiling Pool the shadow have draw a curtain of soft dusk which in the Green Forest become black .
The little star look down from the sky and twinkle just to see their reflection twinkle back at them from the Smiling Pool .
And there and all around it be perfect peace .
Jerry Muskrat swim back and forth , make little silver line on the surface of the Smiling Pool and squeak contentedly , for it be the hour which he love best .
Little Friend the Song Sparrow have tuck his head under his wing and go to sleep among the alder along the Laughing Brook and Redwing the Blackbird have do the same thing among the bulrush .
All the feathered songster who have make joyous the bright day have go to bed .
But this do not mean that the glad spring chorus be silent .
Oh , my , no !
No indeed !
The Green Meadows be silent , and the Green Forest be silent , but a if to make up for this , the sweet singer of the Smiling Pool , the hyla and the frog and Old Mr. Toad , be pour out their gladness a if they have not be sing most of the departed day .
You see it be the hour they love best of all , the hour which seem to them just make for singing , and they be do their best to tell Old Mother Nature how they love her , and how glad they be that she have bring back sweet Mistress Spring to waken them from their long sleep .
It be so peaceful and beautiful there that it do n't seem possible that danger of any kind could be lurk near .
But Old Mr. Toad , swell out that queer music bag in his throat and sing with all his might , never once forget that wise say of his , and so he be the first to see what look like nothing so much a a little detached bit of the blackness of the Green Forest float out towards the Smiling Pool .
Instantly he stop sing .
Now that be a signal .
When he stop sing , his near neighbor stop sing , then the next one and the next , and in a minute there be n't a sound from the Smiling Pool save the squeak of Jerry Muskrat hidden among the bulrush .
That great chorus stop as abruptly a the electric light go out when you press a button .
Back and forth over the Smiling Pool , this way and that way , float the shadow , but there be no sign of any living thing in the Smiling Pool .
After awhile the shadow float away over the Green Meadows without a sound .
`` Hooty the Owl do n't get one of u that time , '' say Old Mr. Toad to his near neighbor with a chuckle of satisfaction .
Then he swell out his music bag and begin to sing again .
And at once , as abruptly a it have stop , the great chorus begin again as joyous a before , for nothing have happen to bring sadness a might have but for the watchfulness of Old Mr. Toad .
VIII OLD MR. TOAD 'S BABIES The Smiling Pool 's a nursery Where all the sunny day A thousand funny baby Are teach while at their play .
Really the Smiling Pool be a sort of kindergarten , one of the most interesting kindergarten in the world .
Little Joe Otter 's child learn to swim there .
So do Jerry Muskrat 's baby and those of Billy Mink , the Trout and Minnow baby , and a lot more .
And there you will find the child and grandchild of Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad .
Peter Rabbit have know for a long time about the Frog baby , but though he know that Old Mr. Toad be own cousin to Grandfather Frog , he have n't know anything about Toad baby , except that at a certain time in the year he be forever run across tiny Toads , especially on rainy day , and each little Toad be just like Old Mr. Toad , except for his size .
Peter have hear it say that Toads rain down from the sky , and sometimes it seem a if this must be so .
Of course he know it could n't be , but it puzzle him a great deal .
There would n't be a Toad in sight .
Then it would begin to rain , and right away there would be so many tiny Toads that it be hard work to jump without step on some .
He remember this a he go to pay his daily call on Old Mr. Toad in the Smiling Pool and listen to his sweet song .
He have n't see any little Toads this year , but he remember his experience with them in other year , and he mean to ask about them .
Old Mr. Toad be sit in his usual place , but he be n't sing .
He be star at something in the water .
When Peter say `` Good morning , '' Old Mr. Toad do n't seem to hear him .
He be too much interested in what he be watch .
Peter star down into the water to see what be interest Old Mr. Toad so much , but he saw nothing but a lot of wriggle tadpole .
`` What be you star at so , Mr. Sobersides ? ''
ask Peter , speak a little loud than before .
Old Mr. Toad turn and look at Peter , and there be a look of great pride in his face .
`` I 'm just watch my baby .
Are n't they lovely ? ''
say he .
Peter star hard than ever , but he could n't see anything that look like a baby Toad .
`` Where be they ? ''
ask he .
`` I do n't see any baby but those of Grandfather Frog , and if you ask me , I always do think tadpole about the homely thing in th ' world . ''
Old Mr. Toad grow indignant .
`` Those be not Grandfather Frog 's child ; they 're mine ! ''
he sputter .
`` And I 'll have you know that they be the most beautiful baby in th ' world ! ''
Peter draw a hand across his mouth to hide a smile .
`` I beg your pardon , Mr. Toad , '' say he .
`` I -- I think all tadpole be Frog baby .
They all look alike to me . ''
`` Well , they 're not , '' declare Old Mr. Toad .
`` How any one can mistake my baby for their cousin I can not understand .
Now mine be beautiful , while -- '' `` Chug-arum ! ''
interrupt the great deep voice of Grandfather Frog .
`` What be you talk about ?
Why , your baby be no more to be compare with my baby for real beauty than nothing at all !
I 'll leave it to Peter if they be . ''
But Peter wisely hold his tongue .
To tell the truth , he could n't see beauty in any of them .
To him they be all just wriggle pollywog .
They be more interesting now , because he have find out that some of them be Toads and some be Frogs , and he have n't know before that baby Toads begin life a tadpole , but he have no intention of be draw into the dispute now wax furious between Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad .
IX THE SMILING POOL KINDERGARTEN Play a little , learn a little , grow a little too ; That 's what every pollywoggy try his best to do .
Of course .
That 's what a kindergarten be for .
And you may be sure that the baby of Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad and Stickytoes the Tree Toad do all of these thing in the kindergarten of the Smiling Pool .
They look considerably alike , do these little cousin , for they be all pollywog to begin with .
Peter Rabbit come over every day to watch them .
Always he have think pollywog just homely , wriggle thing , not the least bit interesting , but since he have discover how proud of them be Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad , he have begin to wonder about them and then to watch them .
`` There 's one thing about them , and that be they be not in danger the way any baby be , '' say Peter , talk to himself a be his way when there be no one else to talk to .
Just then a funny little black pollywog wriggle into sight , and while Peter be watch him , a stout-jawed water-beetle suddenly rush from among the water grass , seize the pollywog by his tail , and drag him down .
Peter star .
Could it be that that ugly-looking bug be as dangerous an enemy to the baby Toad a Reddy Fox be to a baby Rabbit ?
He begin to suspect so , and a little later he know so , for there be that same little pollywog try hard to swim and make bad work of it , because he have lose half of his long tail .
That set Peter to watch sharp than ever , and presently he discover that pollywog have to keep their eye open quite as much a do baby Rabbits , if they would live to grow up .
There be several kind of queer , ugly-looking bug forever dart out at the wriggle pollywog .
Hungry-looking fish lay in wait for them , and Longlegs the Blue Heron seem to have a special liking for them .
But the pollywog be spry , and seem to have learn to watch out .
They seem to Peter to spend all their time swimming and eating and grow .
They grow so fast that it seem to him that he could almost see them grow .
And just imagine how surprised Peter be to discover one day that that very pollywog which he have see lose his tail have grow a new one .
That puzzle Peter more than anything he have see in a long time .
`` Why , I could n't do that ! ''
he exclaim right out loud .
`` Do what ? ''
demand Jerry Muskrat , who happen along just then .
`` Why , grow a new tail like that pollywog , '' reply Peter , and tell Jerry all that he have see .
Jerry laugh .
`` You 'll see queer thing than that if you watch those pollywog long enough , '' say he .
`` They be a queer lot of baby , and very interesting to watch if you 've get the time for it .
I have n't .
This Smiling Pool be a great kindergarten , and there 's something happen here every minute .
There 's no place like it . ''
`` Are those great big fat pollywog Grandfather Frog 's child , or Old Mr. Toad 's ? ''
ask Peter .
`` Grandfather Frog 's last year 's child , '' reply Jerry .
`` They 'll grow into real Frogs this summer , if nothing happen to them . ''
`` Where be Old Mr. Toad 's last year 's child ? ''
ask Peter .
`` Do n't ask me , '' reply Jerry .
`` They hop away last summer .
Never saw anything like the way those Toad youngster grow .
Those Toad pollywog you see now will turn into real Toads , and be leave the Smiling Pool in a few week .
People think Old Mr. Toad be slow , but there be nothing slow about his child .
Look at that little fellow over there ; he 's begin to grow legs already . ''
Peter look , and sure enough there be a pollywog with a pair of leg sprout out .
They be his fore leg , and they certainly do make him look funny .
And only a few day before there have n't be a sign of leg .
`` My gracious ! ''
exclaim Peter .
`` What a funny sight !
I think my baby grow fast , but these beat them . ''
X THE LITTLE TOADS START OUT TO SEE THE WORLD The world be a wonderful great big place And in it the young must roam To learn what their elder have long since learn -- There 's never a place like home .
It have be some time since Peter Rabbit have visit the Smiling Pool to watch the pollywog .
But one cloudy morning he happen to think of them , and decide that he would run over there and see how they be get along .
So off he start , lipperty-lipperty-lip .
He wonder if those pollywog child of Old Mr. Toad would be much change .
The last time he saw them some of them have just begin to grow leg , although they still have long tail .
He have almost reach the Smiling Pool when great big drop of rain begin to splash down .
And with those first raindrop something funny happen .
Anyway , it seem funny to Peter .
Right away he be surround by tiny little Toads .
Everywhere he look he saw Toads , tiny little Toads just like Old Mr. Toad , only so tiny that one could have sit comfortably on a ten-cent piece and still have plenty of room .
Peter 's big eye grow round with surprise a he star .
Where have they all come from so suddenly ?
A minute before he have n't see a single one , and now he could hardly move without step on one .
It seem , it really seem , a if each raindrop turn into a tiny Toad the instant it strike the ground .
Of course Peter know that that could n't be , but it be very puzzling .
And all those little Toads be bravely hop along a if they be bind for some particular place .
Peter watch them for a few minute , then he once more started for the Smiling Pool .
On the very bank whom should he meet but Old Mr. Toad .
He look rather thin , and his back be to the Smiling Pool .
Yes , Sir , he be hop away from the Smiling Pool where he have be all the spring , sing in the great chorus .
Peter be almost a surprised to see him a he have be to see the little Toads , but just then he be most interested in those little Toads .
`` Good morning , Old Mr. Toad , '' say Peter in his most polite manner .
`` Can you tell me where all these little Toads come from ? ''
-LSB- Illustration : `` Can you tell me where all these little Toads come from ? '' -RSB-
`` Certainly , '' reply Old Mr. Toad .
`` They come from the Smiling Pool , of course .
Where do you suppose they come from ? ''
`` I -- I do n't know .
There be n't one to be see , and then it begin to rain , and right away they be everywhere .
It -- it almost seem a if they have rain down out of the sky . ''
Old Mr. Toad chuckle .
`` They 've get good sense , if I must say it about my own child , '' say he .
`` They know that wet weather be the only weather for Toads to travel in .
They leave the Smiling Pool in the night while it be damp and comfortable , and then , when the sun come up , they hide , like sensible child , under anything they could find , stick , stone , piece of bark , grass .
The minute this shower come up , they know it be good traveling weather and out they pop . ''
`` But what do they leave the Smiling Pool for ? ''
Peter ask .
`` To see the Great World , '' reply Old Mr. Toad .
`` Foolish , very foolish of them , but they would do it .
I do the same thing myself when I be their age .
Could n't stop me any more than I could stop them .
They do n't know when they 're well off , but young folk never do .
Fine weather , be n't it ? ''
XI OLD MR. TOAD 'S QUEER TONGUE Old Mother Nature doth provide For all her child , large or small .
Her wisdom foresees all their need And make provision for them all .
If you do n't believe it , just you go ask Old Mr. Toad , a Peter Rabbit do , how such a slow-moving fellow a he be can catch enough bug and insect to keep him alive .
Perhaps you 'll learn something just a Peter do .
Peter and Old Mr. Toad sit in the rain watch the tiny Toads , who , you know , be Mr. Toad 's child , leave their kindergarten in the Smiling Pool and start out to see the Great World .
When the last little Toad have pass them , Old Mr. Toad suddenly remember that he be hungry , very hungry indeed .
`` Did n't have time to eat much while I be in the Smiling Pool , '' he explain .
`` Could n't eat and sing too , and while I be down there , I be suppose to sing .
Now that it be time to quit singing , I begin to realize that I 've get a stomach to look out for as well a a voice .
See that bug over there on that leaf ?
Watch him . ''
Peter look , and sure enough there be a fat bug crawl along on an old leaf .
He be about two inch from Old Mr. Toad , and he be crawl very fast .
And right while Peter be look at him he disappear .
Peter turn to look at Old Mr. Toad .
He have n't budge .
He be sit exactly where he have be sit all the time , but he be smack his lip , and there be a twinkle of satisfaction in his eye .
Peter open his eye very wide .
`` Wha -- what -- '' he begin .
`` Nice bug , '' interrupt Old Mr. Toad .
`` Nicest bug I 've eat for a longtime . ''
`` But I do n't see you catch him ! ''
protest Peter , look at Old Mr. Toad a if he suspect him of joking .
`` Anything wrong with your eye ? ''
inquire Old Mr. Toad .
`` No , '' reply Peter just a wee bit crossly .
`` My eye be just as good a ever . ''
`` Then watch me catch that fly over yonder , '' say Old Mr. Toad .
He hop towards a fly which have light on a blade of grass just ahead .
About two inch from it he stop , and so far a Peter could see , he sit perfectly still .
But the fly disappear , and it be n't because it fly away , either .
Peter be sure of that .
As he tell Mrs. Peter about it afterwards , `` It be there , and then it be n't , and that be all there be to it . ''
Old Mr. Toad chuckle .
`` Did n't you see that one go , Peter ? ''
he ask .
Peter shake his head .
`` I wish you Would stop fool me , '' say Peter .
`` The joke be on me , but now you 've have your laugh at my expense , I wish you would tell me how you do it .
Please , Mr. Toad . ''
Now when Peter say please that way , of course Old Mr. Toad could n't resist him .
Nobody could .
`` Here come an ant this way .
Now you watch my mouth instead of the ant and see what happen , '' say Old Mr. Toad .
Peter look and saw a big black ant come .
Then he keep his eye on Old Mr. Toad 's mouth .
Suddenly there be a little flash of red from it , so tiny and so quick that Peter could n't be absolutely sure that he saw it .
But when he look for the ant , it be nowhere to be see .
Peter look at Old Mr. Toad very hard .
`` Do you mean to tell me , Mr. Toad , that you 've get a tongue long enough to reach way over to where that ant be ? ''
he ask .
Old Mr. Toad chuckle again .
With every insect swallow he felt well natured .
`` You 've guess it , Peter , '' say he .
`` Handy tongue , be n't it ? ''
`` I think it 's a very queer tongue , '' retort Peter , `` and I do n't understand it at all .
If it 's so long a all that , where do you keep it when it be n't in use ?
I should think you 'd have to swallow it to get it out of the way , or else leave it hang out of your mouth . ''
`` Ha , ha , ha , ha , ha ! ''
laugh Old Mr. Toad .
`` My tongue never be in the way , and it 's the handy tongue in the world .
I 'll show it to you . ''
XII OLD MR. TOAD SHOWS HIS TONGUE To show one 's tongue , a you well know , Is not consider nice to do ; But if it be like Mr. Toad 's I 'd want to show it -- would n't you ?
I 'm quite sure you would .
You see , if it be like Old Mr. Toad 's , it would be such a wonderful tongue that I suspect you would want everybody to see it .
Old Mr. Toad think his tongue the most satisfactory tongue in the world .
In fact , he be quite sure that without it he could n't get along at all , and I do n't know a he could .
And yet very few of his neighbor know anything about that tongue and how different it be from most other tongue .
Peter Rabbit do n't until Old Mr. Toad show him after Peter have puzzle and puzzle over the mysterious way in which bug and fly disappear whenever they happen to come within two inch or less of Old Mr. Toad .
What Peter could n't understand be what Old Mr. Toad do with a tongue that would reach two inch beyond his mouth .
He say as much .
`` I 'll show you my tongue , and then you 'll wish you have one just like it , '' say Old Mr. Toad , with a twinkle in his eye .
He open his big mouth and slowly run his tongue out it full length .
`` Why !
Why-ee ! ''
exclaim Peter .
`` It 's fasten at the wrong end ! ''
`` No such thing ! ''
reply Old Mr. Toad indignantly .
`` If it be fasten at the other end , how could I run it out so far ? ''
`` But mine and all other tongue that I ever have see be fastened way down in the throat , '' protest Peter .
`` Yours be fasten at the other end , way in the very front of your mouth .
I never heard of such a thing . ''
`` There be a great many thing you have never hear of , Peter Rabbit , '' reply Old Mr. Toad drily .
`` Mine be the right way to have a tongue .
Because it be fasten way up in the front of my mouth that way , I can use the whole of it .
You see it go out it full length .
Then , when I draw it in with a bug on the end of it , I just turn it over so that the end that be out go way back in my throat and take the bug with it to just the right place to swallow . ''
Peter think this over for a few minute before he venture another question .
`` I begin to understand , '' say he , `` but how do you hold on to the bug with your tongue ? ''
`` My tongue be sticky , of course , Mr. Stupid , '' reply Old Mr. Toad , look very much disgust .
`` Just let me touch a bug with it , and he 's mine every time . ''
Peter think this over .
Then he felt of his own tongue .
`` Mine be n't sticky , '' say he very innocently .
Old Mr. Toad laugh right out .
`` Perhaps if it be , you could n't ask so many question , '' say he .
`` Now watch me catch that fly . ''
His funny little tongue dart out , and the fly be go .
-LSB- Illustration : His funny little tongue dart out , and the fly be go . -RSB-
`` It certainly be very handy , '' say Peter politely .
`` I think we be go to have more rain , and I 'd well be get back to the dear Old Briarpatch .
Very much oblige to you , Mr. Toad .
I think you be very wonderful . ''
`` Not at all , '' reply Old Mr. Toad .
`` I 've simply get the thing I need in order to live , just a you have the thing you need .
I could n't get along with your kind of a tongue , but no more could you get along with mine .
If you live long enough , you will learn that Old Mother Nature make no mistake .
She give each of u what we need , and each one have different need . ''
XIII PETER RABBIT IS IMPOLITE Peter Rabbit could n't get Old Mr. Toad off his mind .
He have discover so many interesting thing about Old Mr. Toad that he be almost on the point of believe him to be the most interesting of all his neighbor .
And his respect for Old Mr. Toad have become very great indeed .
Of course .
Who would n't respect any one with such beautiful eye and such a sweet voice and such a wonderful tongue ?
Yet at the same time Peter felt very foolish whenever he remember that all his life he have be acquaint with Old Mr. Toad without really know him at all .
There be one comforting thought , and that be that most of his neighbor be just a ignorant regard Old Mr. Toad a Peter have be .
`` Funny , '' muse Peter , `` how we can live right beside people all our life and not really know them at all .
I suppose that be why we should never judge people hastily .
I believe I will go hunt up Old Mr. Toad and see if I can find out anything more . ''
Off start Peter , lipperty-lipperty-lip .
He do n't know just where to go , now that Old Mr. Toad have leave the Smiling Pool , but he have an idea that he would not be far from their meeting place of the day before , when Old Mr. Toad have explain about his wonderful tongue .
But when he get there , Peter find no trace of Old Mr. Toad .
You see , it have rain the day before , and that be just the kind of weather that a Toad like best for travel .
Peter ought to have think of that , but he do n't .
He hunt for awhile and finally give it up and start up the Crooked Little Path with the idea of run over for a call on Johnny Chuck in the Old Orchard .
Jolly , round , bright Mr. Sun be shin his brightest , and Peter soon forget all about Old Mr. Toad .
He scamper along up the Crooked Little Path , thinking of nothing in particular but how good it be to be alive , and occasionally kick up his heel for pure joy .
He have just do this when his ear catch the sound of a queer noise a little to one side of the Crooked Little Path .
Instantly Peter stop and sit up to listen .
There it be again , and it seem to come from under an old piece of board .
It be just a little , rustle sound , hardly to be hear .
`` There 's some one under that old board , '' think Peter , and peep under .
All he could see be that there be something move .
Instantly Peter be all curiosity .
Whoever be there be not very big .
He be sure of that .
Of course that mean that he have nothing to fear .
So what do you think Peter do ?
Why , he just pull that old board over .
And when he do that , he saw , whom do you think ?
Why , Old Mr. Toad , to be sure .
But such a sight a Old Mr. Toad be !
Peter just star .
For a full minute he could n't find his voice .
Old Mr. Toad be change his clothes !
Yes , Sir , that be just what Old Mr. Toad be do .
He be take off his old suit , and under it be a brand new one .
But such a time a he be have !
He be open and shut his big mouth , and draw his hind leg under him , and rub them against his body .
Then Peter saw a strange thing .
He saw that Old Mr. Toad 's old suit have split in several place , and he be get it off by suck it into his mouth !
In a few minute his hind leg be free of the old suit , and little by little it begin to be pull free from his body .
All the time Old Mr. Toad be work very hard to suck it at the corner of his big mouth .
He glare angrily at Peter , but he could n't say anything because his mouth be too full .
He look so funny that Peter just throw himself on the ground and roll over and over with laughter .
This make Old Mr. Toad glare more angrily than ever , but he could n't say anything , not a word .
When he have get his hand free by pull the sleeve of his old coat off inside out , he use his hand to pull the last of it over his head .
Then he gulp very hard two or three time to swallow his old suit , and when the last of it have disappear , he find his voice .
`` Do n't you know that it be the most impolite thing in the world to look at people when they be change their clothes ? ''
he sputter .
XIV OLD MR. TOAD DISAPPEARS Admit your fault when you 've do wrong , And do n't postpone it over long .
Peter Rabbit do n't blame Old Mr. Toad a bit for be indignant because Peter have watch him change his suit .
It be n't a nice thing to do .
Old Mr. Toad have look very funny while he be struggle out of his old suit , and Peter just could n't help laugh at him .
But he realize that he have be very impolite , and he very meekly tell Old Mr. Toad so .
`` You see , it be this way , '' explain Peter .
`` I hear something under that old board , and I just naturally turn it over to find out what be there . ''
`` Hump ! ''
grunt Old Mr. Toad .
`` I do n't have the least idea that you be there , '' continue Peter .
`` When I find who it be , and what you be do , I could n't help watching because it be so interesting , and I could n't help laugh because you really do look so funny .
But I 'm sorry , Mr. Toad .
Truly I be .
I do n't mean to be so impolite .
I promise never to do it again .
I do n't suppose , Mr. Toad , that it seem at all wonderful to you that you can change your suit that way , but it do to me .
I have hear that you swallow your old suit , but I never half believe it .
Now I know it be so and just how you do it , and I feel a if I have learn something worth knowing .
Do you know , I think you be one of the most interesting and wonderful of all my neighbor , and I 'll never laugh at or tease you again , Mr. Toad . ''
`` Hump ! ''
grunt Old Mr. Toad again , but it be very clear that he be a little flatter by Peter 's interest in him and be rapidly recover his good nature .
`` There be one thing I do n't understand yet , '' say Peter , `` and that be where you go to to sleep all winter .
Do you go down into the mud at the bottom of the Smiling Pool the way Grandfather Frog do ? ''
`` Certainly not ! ''
retort Old Mr. Toad .
`` Use your common sense , Peter Rabbit .
If I have spend the winter in the Smiling Pool , do you suppose I would have leave it to come way up here and then have turn right around and go back there to sing ?
I 'm not so fond of long journey a all that . ''
`` That 's so . ''
Peter look foolish .
`` I do n't think of that when I speak . ''
`` The trouble with you , and with a lot of other people , be that you speak first and do your think afterward , when you do any thinking at all , '' grunt Old Mr. Toad .
`` Now if I want to , I could disappear right here . ''
`` You mean that you would hide under that old board just a you do before , '' say Peter , with a very wise look .
`` Nothing of the sort ! ''
snap Old Mr. Toad .
`` I could disappear and not go near that old board , not a step near than I be now . ''
Peter look in all direction carefully , but not a thing could he see under which Old Mr. Toad could possibly hide except the old board , and he have say he would n't hide under that .
`` I do n't like to doubt your word , Mr. Toad , '' say he , `` but you 'll have to show me before I can believe that . ''
Old Mr. Toad 's eye twinkle .
Here be a chance to get even with Peter for watch him change his suit .
`` If you 'll turn your back to me and look straight down the Crooked Little Path for five minute , I 'll disappear , '' say he .
`` More than that , I give you my word of honor that I will not hop three foot from where I be sit . ''
`` All right , '' reply Peter promptly , turn his back to Old Mr. Toad .
`` I 'll look down the Crooked Little Path for five minute and promise not to peek . ''
So Peter sit and gaze straight down the Crooked Little Path .
It be a great temptation to roll his eye back and peep behind him , but he have give his word that he would n't , and he do n't .
When he think the five minute be up , he turn around .
Old Mr. Toad be nowhere to be see .
Peter look hastily this way and that way , but there be not a sign of Old Mr. Toad .
He have disappear as completely a if he never have be there .
XV OLD MR. TOAD GIVES PETER A SCARE If you play prank on other folk You may be sure that they Will take the first chance that they get A joke on you to play .
Old Mr. Toad be get even with Peter for laugh at him .
While Peter 's back have be turn , Old Mr. Toad have disappear .
It be too much for Peter .
Look a he would , he could n't see so much a a chip under which Old Mr. Toad might have hide , except the old board , and Old Mr. Toad have give his word of honor that he would n't hide under that .
Nevertheless , Peter hop over to it and turn it over again , because he could n't think of any other place to look .
Of course , Old Mr. Toad be n't there .
Of course not .
He have give his word that he would n't hide there , and he always live up to his word .
Peter should have know good than to have look there .
Old Mr. Toad have also say that he would not go three foot from the spot where he be sit at the time , so Peter should have know good than to have race up the Crooked Little Path a he do .
But if Old Mr. Toad have nothing to hide under , of course he must have hop away , reason Peter .
He could n't hop far in five minute , that be sure , and so Peter run this way and that way a great deal farther than it would have be possible for Old Mr. Toad to have go .
But it be a wholly useless search , and presently Peter return and sit down on the very spot where he have last see Old Mr. Toad .
Peter never have felt more foolish in all his life .
He begin to think that Old Mr. Toad must be bewitch and have some strange power of make himself invisible .
For a long time Peter sit perfectly still , try to puzzle out how Old Mr. Toad have disappear , but the more he puzzle over it , the more impossible it seem .
And yet Old Mr. Toad have disappear .
Suddenly Peter give a frightened scream and jump high than he ever have jump before in all his life .
A voice , the voice of Old Mr. Toad himself , have say , `` Well , now be you satisfy ? ''
And that voice have come from right under Peter !
Do you wonder that he be frighten ?
When he turn to look , there sit Old Mr. Toad right where he himself have be sit a moment before .
Peter rub his eye and star very foolishly .
`` Wh-wh-where do you come from ? ''
he stammer at last .
Old Mr. Toad grin .
`` I 'll show you , '' say he .
And right while Peter be look at him , he begin to sink down into the ground until only the top of his head could be see .
Then that disappear .
Old Mr. Toad have go down , and the sand have fall right back over him .
Peter just have to rub his eye again .
He have to !
Then , to make sure , he begin to dig away the sand where Old Mr. Toad have be sit .
In a minute he felt Old Mr. Toad , who at once come out again .
Old Mr. Toad 's beautiful eye twinkle more than ever .
`` I guess we be even now , Peter , '' say he .
Peter nod .
`` More than that , Mr. Toad .
I think you have a little the best of it , '' he reply .
`` Now wo n't you tell me how you do it ? ''
Old Mr. Toad hold up one of his stout hind foot , and on it be a kind of spur .
`` There 's another just like that on the other foot , '' say he , `` and I use them to dig with .
You go into a hole headfirst , but I go in the other way .
I make my hole in soft earth and back into it at the same time , this way . ''
He begin to work his stout hind foot , and a he kick the earth out , he back in at the same time .
When he be deep enough , the earth just fell back over him , for you see it be very loose and not pack down at all .
When he once more reappeared , Peter thank him .
Then he ask one more question .
`` Is that the way you go into winter quarter ? ''
Old Mr. Toad nod .
`` And it 's the way I escape from my enemy . ''
XVI JIMMY SKUNK IS SURPRISED Jimmy Skunk amble along the Crooked Little Path down the hill .
He do n't hurry because Jimmy do n't believe in hurrying .
The only time he ever hurry be when he see a fat beetle try to get out of sight .
Then Jimmy do hurry .
But just now he do n't see any fat beetle , although he be look for them .
So he just amble along as if he have all the time in the world , a indeed he have .
He be feel very good-natured , be Jimmy Skunk .
And why should n't he ?
There be everything to make him feel good-natured .
Summer have arrive to stay .
On every side he hear glad voice .
Bumble the Bee be hum a song .
Best of all , Jimmy have find three beetle that very morning , and he know that there be more if he could find them .
So why should n't he feel good ?
Jimmy have laugh at Peter Rabbit for be so anxious for Summer to arrive , but he be just as glad a Peter that she have come , although he would n't have say so for the world .
His sharp little eye twinkle a he amble along , and there be n't much that they miss .
As he walk he talk , quite to himself of course , because there be nobody near to hear , and this be what he be say : `` Beetle , beetle , smooth and smug , You be nothing but a bug .
Bugs be make for Skunks to eat , So come out from your retreat .
`` Hello !
There 's a nice big piece of bark over there that look a if it ought to have a dozen fat beetle under it .
It 's great fun to pull over piece of bark and see fat beetle run all way at once .
I 'll just have to see what be under that piece . ''
Jimmy tiptoe softly over to the big piece of bark , and then a he make ready to turn it over , he begin again that foolish little verse .
`` Beetle , beetle , smooth and smug , You be nothing but a bug . ''
As he say the last word , he suddenly pull the piece of bark over .
`` Who 's a bug ? ''
ask a funny voice , and it sound rather cross .
Jimmy Skunk nearly tumble over backward in surprise , and for a minute he could n't find his tongue .
There , instead of the fat beetle he have be so sure of , sit Old Mr. Toad , and he do n't look at all pleased .
`` Who 's a bug ? ''
he repeat .
Instead of answer , Jimmy Skunk begin to laugh .
`` Who 's a bug ? ''
demand Old Mr. Toad , more crossly than before .
`` There be n't any bug , Mr. Toad , and I beg your pardon , '' reply Jimmy , remember his politeness .
`` I just think there be .
You see , I do n't know you be under that piece of bark .
I hope you will excuse me , Mr. Toad .
Have you see any fat beetle this morning ? ''
`` No , '' say Old Mr. Toad grumpily , and yawn and rub his eye .
`` Why , '' exclaim Jimmy Skunk , `` I believe you have just wake up ! ''
`` What if I have ? ''
demand Old Mr. Toad .
`` Oh , nothing , nothing at all , Mr. Toad , '' reply Jimmy Skunk , `` only you be the second one I 've meet this morning who have just wake up . ''
`` Who be the other ? ''
ask Old Mr. Toad .
`` Mr. Blacksnake , '' reply Jimmy .
`` He inquire for you . ''
Old Mr. Toad turn quite pale .
`` I -- I think I 'll be move along , '' say he .
XVII OLD MR. TOAD 'S MISTAKE If be a very little word to look at , but the big word you have ever see do n't begin to have so much meaning a little `` if . ''
If Jimmy Skunk have n't amble down the Crooked Little Path just when he do ; if he have n't be look for fat beetle ; if he have n't see that big piece of bark at one side and decide to pull it over ; if it have n't be for all these `` ifs , '' why Old Mr. Toad would n't have make the mistake he do , and you would n't have have this story .
But Jimmy Skunk do amble down the Crooked Little Path , he do look for beetle , and he do pull over that big piece of bark .
And when he have pull it over , he find Old Mr. Toad there .
Old Mr. Toad have creep under that piece of bark because he want to take a nap .
But when Jimmy Skunk tell him that he have see Mr. Blacksnake that very morning , and that Mr. Blacksnake have ask after Old Mr. Toad , the very last bit of sleepiness leave Old Mr. Toad .
Yes , Sir , he be wide awake right away .
You see , he know right away why Mr. Blacksnake have ask after him .
He know that Mr. Blacksnake have a fondness for Toads .
He turn quite pale when he hear that Mr. Blacksnake have ask after him , and right then he make his mistake .
He be in such a hurry to get away from that neighborhood that he forget to ask Jimmy Skunk just where he have see Mr. Blacksnake .
He hardly wait long enough to say good-by to Jimmy Skunk , but start off as fast a he could go .
Now it just happen that Old Mr. Toad start up the Crooked Little Path , and it just happen that Mr. Blacksnake be come down the Crooked Little Path .
Now when people be very much afraid , they almost always seem to think that danger be behind instead of in front of them .
It be so with Old Mr. Toad .
Instead of watch out in front a he hop along , he keep watch over his shoulder , and that be his second mistake .
He be so sure that Mr. Blacksnake be somewhere behind him that he do n't look to see where he be go , and you know that people who do n't look to see where they be go be almost sure to go headfirst right into trouble .
Old Mr. Toad go hop up the Crooked Little Path a fast a he could , which be n't very fast , because he never can hop very fast .
And all the time he keep look behind for Mr. Blacksnake .
Presently he come to a turn in the Crooked Little Path , and a he hurry around it , he almost run into Mr. Blacksnake himself .
It be a question which be more surprised .
For just a wee second they star at each other .
Then Mr. Blacksnake 's eye begin to sparkle .
`` Good morning , Mr. Toad .
Is n't this a beautiful morning ?
I be just think about you , '' say he .
But poor Old Mr. Toad do n't say good morning .
He do n't say anything .
He could n't , because he be too scared .
He just give a frightened little squeal , turn around , and start down the Crooked Little Path twice as fast a he have come up .
Mr. Blacksnake grin and start after him , not very fast because he know that he would n't have to run very fast to catch Old Mr. Toad , and he think the exercise would do him good .
And this be how it happen that summer morning that jolly , bright Mr. Sun , look down from the blue , blue sky and smile to see how happy everybody seem , suddenly discover that there be one of the little meadow people who be n't happy , but instead be terribly , terribly unhappy .
It be Old Mr. Toad hop down the Crooked Little Path for his life , while after him , and get nearer and nearer , glide Mr. Blacksnake .
XVIII JIMMY SKUNK IS JUST IN TIME Jimmy Skunk amble slowly along , chuckle a he think of what a hurry Mr. Toad have be in , when he have hear that Mr. Blacksnake have ask after him .
It have be funny , very funny indeed , to see Mr. Toad try to hurry .
Suddenly Jimmy stop chuckle .
Then he stop amble along the Crooked Little Path .
He turn around and look back , and a he do so he scratch his head thoughtfully .
He have just happen to think that Old Mr. Toad have go up the Crooked Little Path , and it be up the Crooked Little Path that Mr. Blacksnake have show himself that morning .
`` If he 's still up there , '' think Jimmy , `` Old Mr. Toad be hop right straight into the very bad kind of trouble .
How stupid of him not to have ask me where Mr. Blacksnake be !
Well , it 's none of my business .
I guess I 'll go on . ''
But he have go on down the Crooked Little Path only a few step when he stop again .
You see , Jimmy be really a very kind-hearted little fellow , and somehow he do n't like to think of what might happen to Old Mr. Toad .
`` I hate to go way back there , '' he grumble , for you know he be naturally rather lazy .
`` Still , the Green Meadows would n't be quite the same without Old Mr. Toad .
I should miss him if anything happen to him .
I suppose it would be partly my fault , too , for if I have n't pull over that piece of bark , he probably would have stay there the rest of the day and be safe . ''
`` Maybe he wo n't meet Mr. Blacksnake , '' say a little voice inside of Jimmy .
`` And maybe he will , '' say Jimmy right out loud .
And with that , he start back up the Crooked Little Path , and strange to say Jimmy hurry .
He have just reach a turn in the Crooked Little Path when who should run right plump into him but poor Old Mr. Toad .
He give a frightened squeal and fell right over on his back , and kick foolishly a he try to get on his foot again .
But he be all out of breath , and so frightened and tire that all he could do be to kick and kick .
He have n't see Jimmy at all , for he have be look behind him , and he do n't even know who it be he have run into .
Right behind him come Mr. Blacksnake .
Of course he saw Jimmy , and he stop short and hiss angrily .
`` What be you go to do to Mr. Toad ? ''
demand Jimmy .
`` None of your business ! ''
hiss Mr. Blacksnake .
`` Get out of my way , or you 'll be sorry . ''
Jimmy Skunk just laugh and step in front of poor Old Mr. Toad .
Mr. Blacksnake coil himself up in the path and dart his tongue out at Jimmy in the most impudent way .
Then he try to make himself look very fierce .
Then he jump straight at Jimmy Skunk with his mouth wide open , but he take great care not to jump quite far enough to reach Jimmy .
You see , he be just try to scare Jimmy .
But Jimmy do n't scare .
He know all about Mr. Blacksnake and that really he be a coward .
So he suddenly grit his teeth in a way not at all pleasant to hear and start for Mr. Blacksnake .
Mr. Blacksnake do n't wait .
No , Sir , he do n't wait .
He suddenly turn and glide back up the Crooked Little Path , hiss angrily .
Jimmy follow him a little way , and then he go back to Old Mr. Toad .
`` Oh , '' pant Mr. Toad , `` you come just in time !
I could n't have hop another hop . ''
`` I guess I do , '' reply Jimmy .
`` Now you get your breath and come along with me . ''
And Old Mr. Toad do .
XIX OLD MR. TOAD GETS HIS STOMACH FULL Pray do not tip your nose in scorn At thing which others eat , For thing to you not good at all To others be most sweet .
There be ant , for instance .
You would n't want to eat them even if you be dreadfully hungry .
But Old Mr. Toad and Buster Bear think there be nothing much nicer .
Now Buster Bear have find Old Mr. Toad catch ant , one at a time , a he keep watch beside their home , and it have pleased Buster to find some one else who like ant .
Right away he invite Old Mr. Toad to dine with him .
But poor Old Mr. Toad be frighten almost to death when he hear the deep , grumbly-rumbly voice of Buster Bear , for he have be so busy watch the ant that he have n't see Buster come .
He fell right over on his back , which be n't at all dignify , and make Buster Bear laugh .
That frighten Mr. Toad more than ever .
You see he do n't have the least doubt in the world that Buster Bear meant to eat him , and when Buster invite him to dinner , he be sure that that be just a joke on Buster 's part .
But there be no way to escape , and after a little Old Mr. Toad think it best to be polite , because , you know , it always pay to be polite .
So he say in a very faint voice that he would be please to dine with Buster .
Then he wave his foot feebly , try to get on his foot again .
Buster Bear laugh hard than ever .
It be a low , deep , grumbly-rumbly laugh , and send cold shiver all over poor Old Mr. Toad .
But when Buster reach out a great paw with great cruel-looking claw Mr. Toad quite give up .
He do n't have strength enough left to even kick .
He just close his eye and wait for the end .
What do you think happen ?
Why , he be roll over on to his foot so gently that he just gasp with surprise .
It do n't seem possible that such a great paw could be so gentle .
`` Now , '' say Buster Bear in a voice which he try to make sound pleasant , but which be grumbly-rumbly just the same , `` I know where there be a fine dinner wait for u just a little way from here .
You follow me , and we 'll have it in no time . ''
So Buster Bear lead the way , and Old Mr. Toad follow as fast a he could , because he do n't dare not to .
Presently Buster stop beside a big decayed old log .
`` If you be ready , Mr. Toad , we will dine now , '' say he .
Old Mr. Toad do n't see anything to eat .
His heart sank again , and he shake all over .
`` I -- I 'm not hungry , '' say he in a very faint voice .
Buster Bear do n't seem to hear .
He hook his great claw into the old log and give a mighty pull .
Over roll the log , and there be ant and ant and ant , hurry this way and scurry that way , more ant than Mr. Toad have see in all his life before !
`` Help yourself , '' say Buster Bear politely .
Old Mr. Toad do n't wait to be tell twice .
He forget all about his fright .
He forget all about Buster Bear .
He forget that he be n't hungry .
He forget his manner .
He jump right in among those ant , and for a little while he be the busy Toad ever see .
Buster Bear be busy too .
He sweep his long tongue this way , and he sweep it that way , and each time he draw it back into his mouth , it be cover with ant .
At last Old Mr. Toad could n't hold another ant .
Then he remember Buster Bear and look up a little fearfully .
Buster be smack his lip , and there be a twinkle in each eye .
`` Good , be n't they ? ''
say he .
`` The best I ever eat , '' declare Old Mr. Toad with a sigh of satisfaction .
`` Come dine with me again , '' say Buster Bear , and somehow this time Old Mr. Toad do n't mind because his voice sound grumbly-rumbly .
`` Thank you , I will , '' reply Old Mr. Toad .
XX OLD MR. TOAD IS PUFFED UP Old Mr. Toad hop slowly down the Lone Little Path .
He usually do hop slowly , but this time he hop slow than ever .
You see , he be so puffed up that he could n't have hop fast if he have want to , and he do n't want to .
In the first place his stomach be so full of ant that there be n't room for another one .
No , Sir , Old Mr. Toad could n't have swallow another ant if he have try .
Of course they make his stomach stick out , but it be n't the ant that puff him out all over .
Oh , my , no !
It be pride .
That 's what it be -- pride .
You know nothing can puff any one up quite like foolish pride .
Old Mr. Toad be old enough to have know well .
It be bad enough to see young and foolish creature puff up with pride , but it be bad to see any one as old a Old Mr. Toad that way .
He hold his head so high that he could n't see his own foot , and more than once he stub his toe .
Presently he meet his old friend , Danny Meadow Mouse .
He tip his head a little high , puff himself out a little more , and pretend not to see Danny .
`` Hello , Mr. Toad , '' say Danny .
Mr. Toad pretend not to hear .
Danny look puzzle .
Then he speak again , and this time he shout : `` Hello , Mr. Toad !
I have n't see you for some time . ''
It would n't do to pretend not to hear this time .
`` Oh , how do you do , Danny ? ''
say Old Mr. Toad with a very grand air , and pretend to be much surprise .
`` Sorry I ca n't stop , but I 've be din with , my friend , Buster Bear , and now I must get home . ''
When he mention the name of Buster Bear , he puff himself out a little more .
Danny grin a he watch him hop on down the Lone Little Path .
`` Ca n't talk with common folk any more , '' he mutter .
`` I 've hear that pride be very apt to turn people 's head , but I never expect to see Old Mr. Toad proud . ''
-LSB- Illustration : `` Ca n't talk with common folk any more , '' he mutter . -RSB-
Mr. Toad keep on his way , and presently he meet Peter Rabbit .
Peter stop to gossip , a be his way .
But Old Mr. Toad take no notice of him at all .
He keep right on with his head high , and all puff out .
Peter might have be a stick or a stone for all the notice Old Mr. Toad take of him .
Peter look puzzle .
Then he hurry down to tell Danny Meadow Mouse about it .
`` Oh , '' say Danny , `` he 's be to dine with Buster Bear , and now he have no use for his old friend . ''
Pretty soon along come Johnny Chuck , and he be very much put out because he have be treat by Old Mr. Toad just a Peter Rabbit have .
Striped Chipmunk tell the same story .
So do Unc ' Billy Possum .
It be the same with all of Old Mr. Toad 's old friend and neighbor , except Bobby Coon , who , you know , be Buster Bear 's little cousin .
To him Old Mr. Toad be very polite and talk a great deal about Buster Bear , and think that Bobby must be very proud to be relate to Buster .
At first everybody think it a great joke to see Old Mr. Toad so puff up with , pride , but after a little they grow tire of be snub by their old friend and neighbor , and begin to say unpleasant thing about him .
Then they decide that what Old Mr. Toad need be a lesson , so they put their head together and plan how they would teach Old Mr. Toad how foolish it be for any one to be puff up with pride .
XXI OLD MR. TOAD RECEIVES ANOTHER INVITATION The friend and neighbor of Old Mr. Toad decide that he need to be teach a lesson .
At first , you know , every one have laugh at him , because he have grow too proud to speak to them , but after a little they grow tire of be treat so , and some of them put their head together to think of some plan to teach Old Mr. Toad a lesson and what a very , very foolish thing false pride be .
The very next day Jimmy Skunk go into the Green Forest to look for Buster Bear .
You know Jimmy be n't afraid of Buster .
He do n't have to look long , and when he have find him , the very first thing he do be to ask Buster if he have see any fat beetle that morning .
You know Jimmy be very fond of fat beetle , and the first thing he ask any one he may happen to meet be if they have see any .
Buster Bear grin and say he think he know where there might be a few , and he would be please to have Jimmy go with him to see .
Sure enough , under an old log he find five fat beetle , and these Jimmy gobble up without even ask Buster if he would have one .
Jimmy be usually very polite , but this time he quite forget politeness .
I be afraid he be rather apt to when fat beetle be concern .
But Buster do n't seem to mind .
When the last beetle have disappear Jimmy smack his lip , and then he tell Buster Bear what he have come for .
Of course , at first Buster have think it be for the fat beetle .
But it be n't .
No , Sir , it be n't for the fat beetle at all .
It be to get Buster Bear 's help in a plan to teach Old Mr. Toad a lesson .
First Jimmy tell Buster all about how puffed up Old Mr. Toad be because he have din with Buster , and how ever since then he have refuse even to speak to his old friend and neighbor .
It tickle Buster Bear so to think that little homely Old Mr. Toad could be proud of anything that he laugh and laugh , and his laugh be deep and grumbly-rumbly .
Then Jimmy tell him the plan to teach Old Mr. Toad a lesson and ask Buster if he would help .
Buster 's eye twinkle a he promise to do what Jimmy ask .
Then Jimmy go straight to where Old Mr. Toad be sit all puff up , take a sun-bath .
`` Buster Bear have just send word by me to ask if you will honor him by din with him to-morrow at the rotted chestnut stump near the edge of the Green Forest , '' say Jimmy in his politest manner .
Now if Old Mr. Toad be puff up before , just think how he swell out when he hear that .
Jimmy Skunk be actually afraid that he would burst .
`` You may tell my friend , Buster Bear , that I shall be very happy to honor him by din with him , '' reply Old Mr. Toad with a very grand air .
Jimmy go off to deliver his reply , and Old Mr. Toad sit and puff himself out until he could hardly breathe .
`` Honor him by din with him , '' say he over and over to himself .
`` I never be so flatter in my life . ''
XXII OLD MR. TOAD LEARNS A LESSON Pride be like a great big bubble ; You 'll find there 's nothing in it .
Prick it and for all your trouble It have vanish in a minute .
Old Mr. Toad be so puffed out with pride a he start for the Green Forest to dine with Buster Bear that those who saw him wonder if he would n't burst before he get there .
Everybody know where he be go , and this make Old Mr. Toad feel more important and proud than ever .
He might not have felt quite so puff up if he have know just how it have come about that he receive this second invitation to dine with Buster Bear .
When Jimmy Skunk bring it to him , Jimmy do n't tell him that Buster have be ask to send the invitation , and that it be all part of a plan on the part of some of Old Mr. Toad 's old friend and neighbor to teach him a lesson .
No , indeed , Jimmy do n't say anything at all about that !
So Old Mr. Toad go hop along and stumble over his own foot , because his head be hold so high and he be so puffed out that he could n't see where he be go .
He could think of nothing but how important Buster Bear must consider him to invite him to dinner a second time , and of the delicious ant he be sure he would have to eat .
`` What very good taste Buster Bear have , '' think he , `` and how very fortunate it be that he find out that I also be fond of ant . ''
He be so busy with these pleasant thought and of the good dinner that he expect to have that he take no notice of what be go on about him .
He do n't see his old friend and neighbor peep out at him and laugh because he look so foolish and silly .
He be dress in his very best , which be nothing at all to be proud of , for you know Old Mr. Toad have no fine clothes .
And be puff up so , he be homelier than ever , which be say a great deal , for at best Mr. Toad be anything but handsome .
He be begin to get pretty tire by the time he reach the Green Forest and come in sight of the rotted old chestnut stump where he be to meet Buster Bear .
Buster be wait for him .

-LSB- Illustration : `` I be a little warm , '' reply Mr. Toad in his most polite manner . -RSB-
Buster Bear laugh a great , grumbly-rumbly laugh .
`` I always feel fine when there be a dinner of fat ant ready for me , '' say he .
`` It be fine of you to honor me by come to dine . ''
Here Mr. Toad put one hand on his stomach and try to make a very grand bow .
Peter Rabbit , hide behind a near-by tree , almost giggle aloud , he look so funny .
`` I have venture to invite another to enjoy the dinner with u , '' continue Buster Bear .
Mr. Toad 's face fell .
You see he be selfish .
He want to be the only one to have the honor of din with Buster Bear .
`` He 's a little late , '' go on Buster , `` but I think he will be here soon , and I hope you will be glad to meet him .
Ah , there he come now ! ''
Old Mr. Toad look in the direction in which Buster Bear be look .
He give a little gasp and turn quite pale .
All his puffiness disappear .
He do n't look like the same Toad at all .
The newcomer be Mr. Blacksnake .
`` Oh ! ''
cry Old Mr. Toad , and then , without even ask to be excuse , he turn his back on Buster Bear and start back the way he have come , with long , frightened hop .
`` Ha , ha , ha ! ''
shout Peter Rabbit , jump out from behind a tree .
`` Ho , ho , ho ! ''
shout Jimmy Skunk from behind another .
`` Hee , hee , hee ! ''
shout Johnny Chuck from behind a third .
Then Old Mr. Toad know that his old friend and neighbor have plan this to teach him a lesson .
XXIII OLD MR. TOAD IS VERY HUMBLE When Old Mr. Toad saw Mr. Blacksnake and turn his back on Buster Bear and the fine dinner to which Buster have invite him , he have but just one idea in his head , and that be to get out of sight of Mr. Blacksnake as soon a possible .
He forget to ask Buster Bear to excuse him .
He forget that he be tire and hot .
He forget all the pride with which he have be so puffed up .
He forget everything but the need of get out of sight of Mr. Blacksnake as soon a ever he could .
So away go Old Mr. Toad , hop , hop , hipperty-hop , hop , hop , hipperty-hop !
He hear Peter Rabbit and Jimmy Skunk and Johnny Chuck and others of his old friend and neighbor shout with laughter .
Yes , and he hear the deep , grumbly-rumbly laugh of Buster Bear .
But he do n't mind it .
Not then , anyway .
He have n't room for any feeling except fear of Mr. Blacksnake .
But Old Mr. Toad have to stop after a while .
You see , his leg be so tired they just would n't go any longer .
And he be so out of breath that he wheeze .
He crawl under a big piece of bark , and there he lay flat on the ground and pant and pant for breath .
He would stay there until jolly , round , bright Mr. Sun go to bed behind the Purple Hills .
Then Mr. Blacksnake would go to bed too , and it would be safe for him to go home .
Now , lie there in the dark , for it be dark under that big piece of bark , Old Mr. Toad have time to think .
Little by little he begin to understand that his invitation to dine with Buster Bear have be part of a plan by his old friend and neighbor whom he have so snubbed and look down on when he have be puff up with pride , to teach him a lesson .
At first he be angry , very angry indeed .
Then he begin to see how foolish and silly he have be , and shame take the place of anger .
As he remember the deep , grumbly-rumbly laughter of Buster Bear , the feeling of shame grow .
`` I deserve it , '' think Old Mr. Toad .
`` Yes , Sir , I deserve every bit of it .
The only thing that I have to be proud of be that I 'm honest and work for my living .
Yes , Sir , that 's all . ''
When darkness come at last , and he crawl out to go home , he be feel very humble .
Peter Rabbit happen along just then .
Old Mr. Toad open his mouth to speak , but Peter suddenly throw his head up very high and strut past a if he do n't see Old Mr. Toad at all .
Mr. Toad gulp and go on .
Pretty soon he meet Jimmy Skunk .
Jimmy go right on about his business and actually step right over Old Mr. Toad a if he have be a stick or a stone .
Old Mr. Toad gulp again and go on .
The next day he go down to see Danny Meadow Mouse .
He mean to tell Danny how ashamed he be for the way he have treat Danny and his other friend .
But Danny brush right past without even a glance at him .
Old Mr. Toad gulp and start up to see Johnny Chuck .
The same thing happen again .
So it do when he meet Striped Chipmunk .
At last Old Mr. Toad give up and go home , where he sit under a big mullein leaf the rest of the day , feel very miserable and lonely .
He do n't have appetite enough to snap at a single fly .
Late that afternoon he hear a little noise and look up to find all his old friend and neighbor form a circle around him .
Suddenly they begin to dance and shout : `` Old Mr. Toad be a jolly good fellow !
His temper be sweet , disposition be mellow !
And now that his bubble of pride be quite bust We know that he know that his friend can be trust . ''
Then Old Mr. Toad know that all be well once more , and presently he begin to dance too , the funny dance that ever be see .
This be all for now about homely Old Mr. Toad , because I have just get to tell you about another homely fellow , -- Prickly Porky the Porcupine , -- who carry a thousand little spear .
The next book will tell you all about his adventure .

The goddaughter do not feel much faith in the fairy after her two previous failure ; but not know what else to do , she tell her father what she be bid .
The king make no difficulty about it , and even give his finest ruby and diamond to ornament the dress , which be so dazzling , when finish , that it could not be look at save through smoked glass !
When the princess saw it , she pretend that the sight hurt her eye , and retire to her room , where she find the fairy await her , very much ashamed of herself .

` Take heart , ' she say , ` all will now go well !
Wrap yourself in this skin , and leave the palace and go as far a you can .
I will look after you .
Your dress and your jewel shall follow you underground , and if you strike the earth whenever you need anything , you will have it at once .
But go quickly : you have no time to lose . '
So the princess clothe herself in the as 's skin , and slip from the palace without be see by anyone .
Directly she be miss there be a great hue and cry , and every corner , possible and impossible , be search .
Then the king send out party along all the road , but the fairy throw her invisible mantle over the girl when they approach , and none of them could see her .
The princess walk on a long , long way , try to find some one who would take her in , and let her work for them ; but though the cottager , whose house she pass , give her food from charity , the as 's skin be so dirty they would not allow her to enter their house .
For her flight have be so hurried she have have no time to clean it .
Tired and dishearten at her ill-fortune , she be wander , one day , past the gate of a farmyard , situate just outside the wall of a large town , when she hear a voice call to her .
She turn and saw the farmer 's wife standing among her turkey , and make sign to her to come in . '
I want a girl to wash the dish and fee the turkey , and clean out the pig-sty , ' say the woman , ` and , to judge by your dirty clothes , you would not be too fine for the work . '
The girl accept her offer with joy , and she be at once set to work in a corner of the kitchen , where all the farm servant come and make fun of her , and the as 's skin in which she be wrap .
But by-and-by they get so use to the sight of it that it cease to amuse them , and she work so hard and so well , that her mistress grow quite fond of her .
And she be so clever at keep sheep and herd turkey that you would have think she have do nothing else during her whole life !
One day she be sit on the bank of a stream bewail her wretched lot , when she suddenly catch sight of herself in the water .
Her hair and part of her face be quite conceal by the as 's head , which be draw right over like a hood , and the filthy mat skin cover her whole body .
It be the first time she have see herself a other people saw her , and she be fill with shame at the spectacle .
Then she throw off her disguise and jump into the water , plunge in again and again , till she shone like ivory .
When it be time to go back to the farm , she be force to put on the skin which disguise her , and now seem more dirty than ever ; but , a she do so , she comfort herself with the thought that to-morrow be a holiday , and that she would be able for a few hour to forget that she be a farm girl , and be a princess once more .
So , at break of day , she stamp on the ground , a the fairy have tell her , and instantly the dress like the sky lay across her tiny bed .
Her room be so small that there be no place for the train of her dress to spread itself out , but she pin it up carefully when she comb her beautiful hair and pile it up on the top of her head , a she have always wear it .
When she have do , she be so pleased with herself that she determine never to let a chance pas of put on her splendid clothes , even if she have to wear them in the field , with no one to admire her but the sheep and turkey .
Now the farm be a royal farm , and , one holiday , when ` Donkey Skin ' -LRB- a they have nickname the princess -RRB- have lock the door of her room and clothe herself in her dress of sunshine , the king 's son rode through the gate , and ask if he might come and rest himself a little after hunt .
Some food and milk be set before him in the garden , and when he felt rest he get up , and begin to explore the house , which be famous throughout the whole kingdom for it age and beauty .
He open one door after the other , admire the old room , when he come to a handle that would not turn .
He stoop and peep through the keyhole to see what be inside , and be greatly astonish at behold a beautiful girl , clad in a dress so dazzling that he could hardly look at it .
The dark gallery seem darker than ever a he turn away , but he go back to the kitchen and inquire who sleep in the room at the end of the passage .
The scullery maid , they tell him , whom everybody laugh at , and call ` Donkey Skin ; ' and though he perceive there be some strange mystery about this , he saw quite clearly there be nothing to be gain by ask any more question .
So he ride back to the palace , his head fill with the vision he have see through the keyhole .
All night long he toss about , and awake the next morning in a high fever .
The queen , who have no other child , and live in a state of perpetual anxiety about this one , at once give him up for lose , and indeed his sudden illness puzzle the great doctor , who try the usual remedy in vain .
At last they tell the queen that some secret sorrow must be at the bottom of all this , and she throw herself on her knee beside her son 's bed , and implore him to confide his trouble to her .
If it be ambition to be king , his father would gladly resign the care of the crown , and suffer him to reign in his stead ; or , if it be love , everything should be sacrifice to get for him the wife he desire , even if she be daughter of a king with whom the country be at war at present !
` Madam , ' reply the prince , whose weakness would hardly allow him to speak , ` do not think me so unnatural a to wish to deprive my father of his crown .
As long a he live I shall remain the most faithful of his subject !
And a to the princess you speak of , I have see none that I should care for a a wife , though I would always obey your wish , whatever it might cost me . '
` Ah !
my son , ' cry she , ` we will do anything in the world to save your life -- and ours too , for if you die , we shall die also . '
` Well , then , ' reply the prince , ' I will tell you the only thing that will cure me -- a cake make by the hand of `` Donkey Skin . '' '
` Donkey Skin ? '
exclaim the queen , who think her son have go mad ; ` and who or what be that ? '
` Madam , ' answer one of the attendant present , who have be with the prince at the farm , ' `` Donkey Skin '' be , next to the wolf , the most disgusting creature on the face of the earth .
She be a girl who wear a black , greasy skin , and live at your farmer 's a hen-wife . '
` Never mind , ' say the queen ; ` my son seem to have eat some of her pastry .
It be the whim of a sick man , no doubt ; but send at once and let her bake a cake . '
The attendant bow and order a page to ride with the message .
Now it be by no mean certain that ` Donkey Skin ' have not catch a glimpse of the prince , either when his eye look through the keyhole , or else from her little window , which be over the road .
But whether she have actually see him or only hear him spoken of , directly she receive the queen 's command , she fling off the dirty skin , wash herself from head to foot , and put on a skirt and bodice of shin silver .
Then , lock herself into her room , she take the rich cream , the fine flour , and the fresh egg on the farm , and set about make her cake .
As she be stir the mixture in the saucepan a ring that she sometimes wore in secret slipped from her finger and fell into the dough .
Perhaps ` Donkey Skin ' saw it , or perhaps she do not ; but , any way , she go on stirring , and soon the cake be ready to be put in the oven .
When it be nice and brown she take off her dress and put on her dirty skin , and give the cake to the page , ask at the same time for news of the prince .
But the page turn his head aside , and would not even condescend to answer .
The page rode like the wind , and as soon a he arrive at the palace he snatch up a silver tray and hasten to present the cake to the prince .
The sick man begin to eat it so fast that the doctor think he would choke ; and , indeed , he very nearly do , for the ring be in one of the bit which he break off , though he manage to extract it from his mouth without anyone see him .
The moment the prince be leave alone he draw the ring from under his pillow and kiss it a thousand time .
Then he set his mind to find how he be to see the owner -- for even he do not dare to confess that he have only beheld ` Donkey Skin ' through a keyhole , lest they should laugh at this sudden passion .
All this worry bring back the fever , which the arrival of the cake have diminish for the time ; and the doctor , not know what else to say , inform the queen that her son be simply die of love .
The queen , stricken with horror , rush into the king 's presence with the news , and together they hasten to their son 's bedside .
` My boy , my dear boy ! '
cry the king , ` who be it you want to marry ?
We will give her to you for a bride , even if she be the humblest of our slave .
What be there in the whole world that we would not do for you ? '
The prince , move to tear at these word , draw the ring , which be an emerald of the pure water , from under his pillow .
` Ah , dear father and mother , let this be a proof that she whom I love be no peasant girl .
The finger which that ring fit have never be thicken by hard work .
But be her condition what it may , I will marry no other . '
The king and queen examine the tiny ring very closely , and agree , with their son , that the wearer could be no mere farm girl .
Then the king go out and order herald and trumpeter to go through the town , summon every maiden to the palace .
And she whom the ring fit would some day be queen .
First come all the princess , then all the duchess ' daughter , and so on , in proper order .
But not one of them could slip the ring over the tip of her finger , to the great joy of the prince , whom excitement be fast cure .
At last , when the high-born damsel have fail , the shopgirls and chambermaid take their turn ; but with no good fortune .
` Call in the scullion and shepherdess , ' command the prince ; but the sight of their fat , red finger satisfy everybody .
` There be not a woman leave , your Highness , ' say the chamberlain ; but the prince wave him aside .
` Have you send for `` Donkey Skin , '' who make me the cake ? '
ask he , and the courtier begin to laugh , and reply that they would not have dare to introduce so dirty a creature into the palace .
` Let some one go for her at once , ' order the king . '
I command the presence of every maiden , high or low , and I mean it . '
The princess have hear the trumpet and the proclamation , and know quite well that her ring be at the bottom of it all .
She too , have fall in love with the prince in the brief glimpse she have have of him , and tremble with fear lest someone else 's finger might be as small a her own .
When , therefore , the messenger from the palace ride up to the gate , she be nearly beside herself with delight .
Hoping all the time for such a summons , she have dress herself with great care , put on the garment of moonlight , whose skirt be scatter over with emerald .
But when they begin call to her to come down , she hastily cover herself with her donkey-skin and announce she be ready to present herself before his Highness .
She be take straight into the hall , where the prince be await her , but at the sight of the donkey-skin his heart sank .
Had he be mistake after all ?
` Are you the girl , ' he say , turn his eye away a he speak , ` be you the girl who have a room in the furthest corner of the inner court of the farmhouse ? '
` Yes , my lord , I be , ' answer she .
` Hold out your hand then , ' continue the prince , feel that he must keep his word , whatever the cost , and , to the astonishment of every one present , a little hand , white and delicate , come from beneath the black and dirty skin .
The ring slip on with the utmost ease , and , a it do so , the skin fell to the ground , disclose a figure of such beauty that the prince , weak a he be , fell on his knee before her , while the king and queen join their prayer to his .
Indeed , their welcome be so warm , and their caress so bewilder , that the princess hardly know how to find word to reply , when the ceiling of the hall open , and the fairy godmother appear , seat in a car make entirely of white lilac .
In a few word she explain the history of the princess , and how she come to be there , and , without lose a moment , preparation of the most magnificent kind be make for the wedding .
-LSB- Illustration : The Donkey-skin fall off . -RSB-
The king of every country in the earth be invite , include , of course , the princess 's adopt father -LRB- who by this time have marry a widow -RRB- , and not one refuse .
But what a strange assembly it be !
Each monarch travel in the way he think most impressive ; and some come borne in litter , others have carriage of every shape and kind , while the rest be mount on elephant , tiger , and even upon eagle .
So splendid a wedding have never be see before ; and when it be over the king announce that it be to be follow by a coronation , for he and the queen be tire of reigning , and the young couple must take their place .
The rejoicing last for three whole month , then the new sovereign settle down to govern their kingdom , and make themselves so much beloved by their subject , that when they die , a hundred year later , each man mourn them a his own father and mother .

THE GOBLIN PONY ` Do n't stir from the fireplace to-night , ' say old Peggy , ` for the wind be blow so violently that the house shake ; besides , this be Hallow-e ` en , when the witch be abroad , and the goblin , who be their servant , be wander about in all sort of disguise , do harm to the child of men . '
` Why should I stay here ? '
say the eldest of the young people .
` No , I must go and see what the daughter of old Jacob , the rope-maker , be do .
She would n't close her blue eye all night if I do n't visit her father before the moon have go down . ' '
I must go and catch lobster and crab , ' say the second , ` and not all the witch and goblin in the world shall hinder me . '
So they all determine to go on their business or pleasure , and scorn the wise advice of old Peggy .
Only the young child hesitate a minute , when she say to him , ` You stay here , my little Richard , and I will tell you beautiful story . '
But he want to pick a bunch of wild thyme and some blackberry by moonlight , and run out after the others .
When they get outside the house they say : ` The old woman talk of wind and storm , but never be the weather finer or the sky more clear ; see how majestically the moon stalk through the transparent cloud ! '
Then all of a sudden they notice a little black pony close beside them .
` Oh , ho ! '
they say , ` that be old Valentine 's pony ; it must have escape from it stable , and be go down to drink at the horse-pond . '
` My pretty little pony , ' say the eldest , pat the creature with his hand , ` you must n't run too far ; I 'll take you to the pond myself . '
With these word he jump on the pony 's back and be quickly follow by his second brother , then by the third , and so on , till at last they be all astride the little beast , down to the small Richard , who do n't like to be leave behind .
-LSB- Illustration : The Goblin Pony -RSB- On the way to the pond they meet several of their companion , and they invite them all to mount the pony , which they do , and the little creature do not seem to mind the extra weight , but trot merrily along .
The quicker it trot the more the young people enjoy the fun ; they dig their heel into the pony 's side and call out , ` Gallop , little horse , you have never have such brave rider on your back before ! '
In the meantime the wind have rise again , and the wave begin to howl ; but the pony do not seem to mind the noise , and instead of go to the pond , canter gaily towards the sea-shore .
Richard begin to regret his thyme and blackberry , and the eldest brother seize the pony by the mane and try to make it turn round , for he remember the blue eye of Jacob the rope-maker 's daughter .
But he tug and pull in vain , for the pony gallop straight on into the sea , till the wave meet it forefoot .
As soon a it felt the water it neigh lustily and caper about with glee , advance quickly into the foaming billow .
When the wave have cover the child 's leg they repent their careless behaviour , and cry out : ` The cursed little black pony be bewitch .
If we have only listen to old Peggy 's advice we should n't have be lose . '
The further the pony advance , the high rise the sea ; at last the wave cover the child 's head and they be all drown .
Towards morning old Peggy go out , for she be anxious about the fate of her grandchild .
She seek them high and low , but could not find them anywhere .
She ask all the neighbour if they have see the child , but no one know anything about them , except that the eldest have not be with the blue-eyed daughter of Jacob the rope-maker .
As she be go home , bow with grief , she saw a little black pony come towards her , spring and curvet in every direction .
When it get quite near her it neigh loudly , and gallop past her so quickly that in a moment it be out of her sight .

Her silence rather surprise him , but he be still more astonished when he find that she never speak once all through supper-time .
Sometimes she seem about to speak , but whenever this be the case her father or mother at once take up the conversation .
However , this silence do not cool the king 's affection , and when he retire to his room at night he confide his feeling to his faithful equerry .
But the equerry be by no mean delight at his king 's love affair , and take no pain to hide his disappointment .
` But why be you vexed ? '
ask the king .
` Surely the princess be beautiful enough to please anyone ? '
` She be certainly very handsome , ' reply the equerry , ` but to be really happy in love something more than beauty be require .
To tell the truth , sire , ' he add , ` her expression seem to me hard . '
` That be pride and dignity , ' say the king , ` and nothing can be more become . '
` Pride or hardness , a you will , ' say the equerry ; ` but to my mind the choice of so many fierce creature for her amusement seem to tell of a fierce nature , and I also think there be something suspicious in the care take to prevent her speaking . '
The equerry 's remark be full of good sense ; but a opposition be only apt to increase love in the heart of men , and especially of king who hate be contradict , this king beg , the very next day , for the hand of the Princess Mutinosa .
It be grant him on two condition .
The first be that the wedding should take place the very next day ; and the second , that he should not speak to the princess till she be his wife ; to all of which the king agree , in spite of his equerry 's objection , so that the first word he hear his bride utter be the ` Yes ' she speak at their marriage .
Once marry , however , she no longer place any check on herself , and her ladies-in-waiting come in for plenty of rude speech -- even the king do not escape scold ; but a he be a good-tempered man , and very much in love , he bore it patiently .
A few day after the wed the newly marry pair set out for their kingdom without leave many regret behind .
The good equerry 's fear prove only too true , a the king find out to his cost .
The young queen make herself most disagreeable to all her court , her spite and bad temper know no bound , and before the end of a month she be know far and wide a a regular vixen .
One day , when rid out , she meet a poor old woman walk along the road , who make a curtsy and be go on , when the queen have her stop , and cry : ` You be a very impertinent person ; do n't you know that I be the queen ?
And how dare you not make me a deep curtsy ? '
` Madam , ' say the old woman , ' I have never learn how to measure curtsy ; but I have no wish to fail in proper respect . '
` What ! '
scream the queen ; ` she dare to answer !
Tie her to my horse 's tail and I 'll just carry her at once to the best dancing-master in the town to learn how to curtsy . '
The old woman shriek for mercy , but the queen would not listen , and only mock when she say she be protect by the fairy .
At last the poor old thing submit to be tie up , but when the queen urge her horse on he never stir .
In vain she spur him , he seem turned to bronze .
At the same moment the cord with which the old woman be tie change into wreath of flower , and she herself into a tall and stately lady .
Looking disdainfully at the queen , she say , ` Bad woman , unworthy of your crown ; I wish to judge for myself whether all I hear of you be true .
I have now no doubt of it , and you shall see whether the fairy be to be laugh at . '
So say the fairy Placida -LRB- that be her name -RRB- blow a little gold whistle , and a chariot appear draw by six splendid ostrich .
In it be seat the fairy queen , escort by a dozen other fairy mount on dragon .
All have dismount , Placida tell her adventure , and the fairy queen approve all she have do , and propose turn Mutinosa into bronze like her horse .
Placida , however , who be very kind and gentle , beg for a milder sentence , and at last it be settle that Mutinosa should become her slave for life unless she should have a child to take her place .
The king be tell of his wife 's fate and submit to it , which , a he could do nothing to help it , be the only course open to him .
The fairy then all disperse , Placida take her slave with her , and on reach her palace she say : ` You ought by right to be scullion , but a you have be delicately bring up the change might be too great for you .
I shall therefore only order you to sweep my room carefully , and to wash and comb my little dog . '
Mutinosa felt there be no use in disobeying , so she do a she be bid and say nothing .
After some time she give birth to a most lovely little girl , and when she be well again the fairy give her a good lecture on her past life , make her promise to behave good in future , and send her back to the king , her husband .
Placida now give herself up entirely to the little princess who be leave in her charge .
She anxiously think over which of the fairy she would invite to be godmother , so a to secure the best gift , for her adopted child .
At last she decide on two very kindly and cheerful fairy , and ask them to the christening feast .
Directly it be over the baby be bring to them in a lovely crystal cradle hung with red silk curtain embroider with gold .
The little thing smile so sweetly at the fairy that they decide to do all they could for her .
They begin by name her Graziella , and then Placida say : ` You know , dear sister , that the common form of spite or punishment amongst u consist of change beauty to ugliness , cleverness to stupidity , and oftener still to change a person 's form altogether .
Now , a we can only each bestow one gift , I think the best plan will be for one of you to give her beauty , the other good understanding , whilst I will undertake that she shall never be change into any other form . '
The two godmother quite agree , and as soon a the little princess have receive their gift , they go home , and Placida give herself up to the child 's education .
She succeed so well with it , and little Graziella grow so lovely , that when she be still quite a child her fame be spread abroad only too much , and one day Placida be surprise by a visit from the Fairy Queen , who be attend by a very grave and severe-looking fairy .
The queen begin at once : ' I have be much surprise by your behaviour to Mutinosa ; she have insult our whole race , and deserve punishment .
You might forgive your own wrong if you choose , but not those of others .
You treat her very gently whilst she be with you , and I come now to avenge our wrong on her daughter .
You have ensure her be lovely and clever , and not subject to change of form , but I shall place her in an enchanted prison , which she shall never leave till she find herself in the arm of a lover whom she herself love .
It will be my care to prevent anything of the kind happen . '
The enchanted prison be a large high tower in the midst of the sea , build of shell of all shape and colour .
The low floor be like a great bathroom , where the water be let in or off at will .
The first floor contain the princess 's apartment , beautifully furnish .
On the second be a library , a large wardrobe-room fill with beautiful clothes and every kind of linen , a music room , a pantry with bin full of the best wine , and a store-room with all manner of preserve , bonbon , pastry and cake , all of which remain as fresh a if just out of the oven .
The top of the tower be lay out like a garden , with bed of the lovely flower , fine fruit tree , and shady arbour and shrub , where many bird sing amongst the branch .
The fairy escort Graziella and her governess , Bonnetta , to the tower , and then mount a dolphin which be wait for them .
At a little distance from the tower the queen wave her wand and summon two thousand great fierce shark , whom she order to keep close guard , and not to let a soul enter the tower .
The good governess take such pain with Graziella 's education that when she be nearly grow up she be not only most accomplished , but a very sweet , good girl .
One day , a the princess be stand on a balcony , she saw the most extraordinary figure rise out of the sea .
She quickly call Bonnetta to ask her what it could be .
It look like some kind of man , with a bluish face and long sea-green hair .
He be swim towards the tower , but the shark take no notice of him .
` It must be a merman , ' say Bonnetta . '
A man , do you say ? '
cried Graziella ; ` let u hurry down to the door and see him nearer . '
When they stand in the doorway the merman stop to look at the princess and make many sign of admiration .
His voice be very hoarse and husky , but when he find that he be not understood he take to sign .
He carry a little basket make of osier and fill with rare shell , which he present to the princess .
She take it with sign of thanks ; but a it be get dusk she retire , and the merman plunge back into the sea .
When they be alone , Graziella say to her governess : ` What a dreadful-looking creature that be !
Why do those odious shark let him come near the tower ?
I suppose all men be not like him ? '
` No , indeed , ' reply Bonnetta . '
I suppose the shark look on him a a sort of relation , and so do not attack him . '
A few day later the two lady hear a strange sort of music , and look out of the window , there be the merman , his head crown with water plant , and blow a great sea-shell with all his might .
They go down to the tower door , and Graziella politely accept some coral and other marine curiosity he have bring her .
After this he use to come every evening , and blow his shell , or dive and play antic under the princess 's window .
She content herself with bow to him from the balcony , but she would not go down to the door in spite of all his sign .
Some day later he come with a person of his own kind , but of another sex .
Her hair be dress with great taste , and she have a lovely voice .
This new arrival induce the lady to go down to the door .
They be surprise to find that , after try various language , she at last spoke to them in their own , and pay Graziella a very pretty compliment on her beauty .
The mermaid notice that the low floor be full of water .
` Why , ' cry she , ` that be just the place for u , for we ca n't live quite out of water . '
So say , she and her brother swam in and take up a position in the bathroom , the princess and her governess seat themselves on the step which run round the room .
-LSB- Illustration : The Sea-People visit Graziella -RSB- ` No doubt , madam , ' say the mermaid , ` you have give up live on land so a to escape from crowd of lover ; but I fear that even here you can not avoid them , for my brother be already die of love for you , and I be sure that once you be see in our city he will have many rival . '
She then go on to explain how grieved her brother be not to be able to make himself understood , add : ' I interpret for him , have be taught several language by a fairy . '
` Oh , then , you have fairy , too ? '
ask Graziella , with a sigh .
` Yes , we have , ' reply the mermaid ; ` but if I be not mistake you have suffer from the fairy on earth . '
The princess , on this , tell her entire history to the mermaid , who assure her how sorry she felt for her , but beg her not to lose courage ; add , a she take her leave : ` Perhaps , some day , you may find a way out of your difficulty . '
The princess be delight with this visit and with the hope the mermaid hold out .
It be something to meet some one fresh to talk to .
` We will make acquaintance with several of these people , ' she say to her governess , ` and I dare say they be not all as hideous a the first one we saw .
Anyhow , we sha n't be so dreadfully lonely . '
` Dear me , ' say Bonnetta , ` how hopeful young people be to be sure !
As for me I feel afraid of these folk .
But what do you think of the lover you have captivate ? '
` Oh , I could never love him , ' cry the princess ; ' I ca n't bear him .
But , perhaps , a his sister say they be relate to the fairy Marina , they may be of some use to u . '
The mermaid often return , and each time she talk of her brother 's love , and each time Graziella talk of her longing to escape from her prison , till at length the mermaid promise to bring the fairy Marina to see her , in hope she might suggest something .
Next day the fairy come with the mermaid , and the princess receive her with delight .
After a little talk she beg Graziella to show her the inside of the tower and let her see the garden on the top , for with the help of crutch she could manage to move about , and be a fairy could live out of water for a long time , provide she wet her forehead now and then .
Graziella gladly consent , and Bonnetta stay below with the mermaid .
When they be in the garden the fairy say : ` Let u lose no time , but tell me how I can be of use to you . '
Graziella then tell all her story and Marina reply : ` My dear princess , I can do nothing for you a regard dry land , for my power do not reach beyond my own element .
I can only say that if you will honour my cousin by accept his hand , you could then come and live amongst u .
I could teach you in a moment to swim and dive with the best of u .
I can harden your skin without spoil it colour .
My cousin be one of the best match in the sea , and I will bestow so many gift on him that you will be quite happy . '
The fairy talk so well and so long that the princess be rather impressed , and promise to think the matter over .
Just a they be go to leave the garden they saw a ship sail nearer the tower than any other have do before .
On the deck lay a young man under a splendid awning , gaze at the tower through a spy-glass ; but before they could see anything clearly the ship move away , and the two lady part , the fairy promising to return shortly .
As soon a she be go Graziella tell her governess what she have say .
Bonnetta be not at all please at the turn matter be take , for she do not fancy be turn into a mermaid in her old age .
She think the matter well over , and this be what she do .
She be a very clever artist , and next morning she begin to paint a picture of a handsome young man , with beautiful curly hair , a fine complexion , and lovely blue eye .
When it be finish she show it to Graziella , hop it would show her the difference there be between a fine young man and her marine suitor .
The princess be much strike by the picture , and ask anxiously whether there could be any man so good-looking in the world .
Bonnetta assure her that there be plenty of them ; indeed , many far handsome . '
I can hardly believe that , ' cry the princess ; ` but , ala !
if there be , I do n't suppose I shall ever see them or they me , so what be the use ?
Oh , dear , how unhappy I be ! '
She spend the rest of the day gaze at the picture , which certainly have the effect of spoil all the merman 's hope or prospect .
After some day , the fairy Marina come back to hear what be decide ; but Graziella hardly pay any attention to her , and show such dislike to the idea of the propose marriage that the fairy go off in a regular huff .
Without know it , the princess have make another conquest .
On board the ship which have sail so near be the handsome prince in the world .
He have hear of the enchanted tower , and determine to get a near it a he could .
He have strong glass on board , and whilst look through them he saw the princess quite clearly , and fell desperately in love with her at once .
He want to steer straight for the tower and to row off to it in a small boat , but his entire crew fell at his foot and beg him not to run such a risk .
The captain , too , urge him not to attempt it .
` You will only lead u all to certain death , ' he say .
` Pray anchor nearer land , and I will then seek a kind fairy I know , who have always be most oblige to me , and who will , I be sure , try to help your Highness . '
The prince rather unwillingly listen to reason .
He land at the near point , and send off the captain in all haste to beg the fairy 's advice and help .
Meantime he have a tent pitch on the shore , and spend all his time gaze at the tower and look for the princess through his spy-glass .
After a few day the captain come back , bring the fairy with him .
The prince be delight to see her , and pay her great attention . '
I have hear about this matter , ' she say ; ` and , to lose no time , I be go to send off a trusty pigeon to test the enchantment .
If there be any weak spot he be sure to find it out and get in .
I shall bid him bring a flower back a a sign of success , and if he do so I quite hope to get you in too . '
` But , ' ask the prince , ` could I not send a line by the pigeon to tell the princess of my love ? '
` Certainly , ' reply the fairy , ` it would be a very good plan . '
So the prince write a follow : -- ` Lovely Princess , -- I adore you , and beg you to accept my heart , and to believe there be nothing I will not do to end your misfortune .
-- Blondel . '
This note be tie round the pigeon 's neck , and he fly off with it at once .
He fly fast till he get near the tower , when a fierce wind blow so hard against him that he could not get on .
But he be not to be beat , but fly carefully round the top of the tower till he come to one spot which , by some mistake , have not be enchant like the rest .
He quickly slip into the arbour and wait for the princess .
Before long Graziella appear alone , and the pigeon at once flutter to meet her , and seem so tame that she stop to caress the pretty creature .
As she do so she saw it have a pink ribbon round it neck , and tie to the ribbon be a letter .
She read it over several time and then write this answer : -- ` You say you love me ; but I can not promise to love you without see you .
Send me your portrait by this faithful messenger .
If I return it to you , you must give up hope ; but if I keep it you will know that to help me will be to help yourself .
-- Graziella . '
Before fly back the pigeon remember about the flower , so , see one in the princess 's dress , he steal it and fly away .
The prince be wild with joy at the pigeon 's return with the note .
After an hour 's rest the trusty little bird be send back again , carry a miniature of the prince , which by good luck he have with him .
On reach the tower the pigeon find the princess in the garden .
She hasten to untie the ribbon , and on open the miniature case what be her surprise and delight to find it very like the picture her governess have paint for her .
She hasten to send the pigeon back , and you can fancy the prince 's joy when he find she have keep his portrait .
` Now , ' say the fairy , ` let u lose no more time .
I can only make you happy by change you into a bird , but I will take care to give you back your proper shape at the right time . '
The prince be eager to start , so the fairy , touch him with her wand , turn him into the lovely humming-bird you ever saw , at the same time let him keep the power of speech .
The pigeon be tell to show him the way .
Graziella be much surprise to see a perfectly strange bird , and still more so when it fly to her say , ` Good-morning , sweet princess . '
She be delight with the pretty creature , and let him perch on her finger , when he say , ` Kiss , kiss , little birdie , ' which she gladly do , petting and stroke him at the same time .
After a time the princess , who have be up very early , grow tire , and a the sun be hot she go to lie down on a mossy bank in the shade of the arbour .
She hold the pretty bird near her breast , and be just fall asleep , when the fairy contrive to restore the prince to his own shape , so that a Graziella open her eye she find herself in the arm of a lover whom she love in return !
At the same moment her enchantment come to an end .
The tower begin to rock and to split .
Bonnetta hurry up to the top so that she might at least perish with her dear princess .
Just a she reach the garden , the kind fairy who have help the prince arrive with the fairy Placida , in a car of Venetian glass drawn by six eagle .
-LSB- Illustration : The Fairy-Car Arrives . -RSB-
` Come away quickly , ' they cry , ` the tower be about to sink ! '
The prince , princess , and Bonnetta lose no time in step into the car , which rise in the air just a , with a terrible crash , the tower sink into the depth of the sea , for the fairy Marina and the merman have destroy it foundation to avenge themselves on Graziella .
Luckily their wicked plan be defeat , and the good fairy take their way to the kingdom of Graziella 's parent .
They find that Queen Mutinosa have die some year ago , but her kind husband live on peaceably , rule his country well and happily .
He receive his daughter with great delight , and there be universal rejoicing at the return of the lovely princess .
The wedding take place the very next day , and , for many day after , ball , dinner , tournament , concert and all sort of amusement go on all day and all night .
All the fairy be carefully invite , and they come in great state , and promise the young couple their protection and all sort of good gift .
Prince Blondel and Princess Graziella live to a good old age , beloved by every one , and love each other more and more a time go on .
THE STORY OF DSCHEMIL AND DSCHEMILA There be once a man whose name be Dschemil , and he have a cousin who be call Dschemila .
They have be betroth by their parent when they be child , and now Dschemil think that the time have come for them to be marry , and he go two or three day ' journey , to the near big town , to buy furniture for the new house .
While he be away , Dschemila and her friend set off to the neighbour wood to pick up stick , and a she gather them she find an iron mortar lie on the ground .
She place it on her bundle of stick , but the mortar would not stay still , and whenever she raise the bundle to put it on her shoulder it slip off sideways .
At length she saw the only way to carry the mortar be to tie it in the very middle of her bundle , and have just unfasten her stick , when she hear her companion ' voice .
` Dschemila , what be you do ?
it be almost dark , and if you mean to come with u you must be quick ! '
But Dschemila only reply , ` You have good go back without me , for I be not go to leave my mortar behind , if I stay here till midnight . '
` Do a you like , ' say the girl , and start on their walk home .
The night soon fell , and at the last ray of light the mortar suddenly become an ogre , who throw Dschemila on his back , and carry her off into a desert place , distant a whole month 's journey from her native town .
Here he shut her into a castle , and tell her not to fear , a her life be safe .
Then he go back to his wife , leave Dschemila weeping over the fate that she have bring upon herself .
Meanwhile the other girl have reach home , and Dschemila 's mother come out to look for her daughter .
` What have you do with her ? '
she ask anxiously .
` We have to leave her in the wood , ' they reply , ` for she have pick up an iron mortar , and could not manage to carry it . '
So the old woman set off at once for the forest , call to her daughter a she hurry along .
` Do go home , ' cry the townspeople , a they hear her ; ` we will go and look for your daughter ; you be only a woman , and it be a task that need strong men . '
But she answer , ` Yes , go ; but I will go with you !
Perhaps it will be only her corpse that we shall find after all .
She have most likely be sting by asp , or eat by wild beast . '
The men , see her heart be bend on it , say no more , but tell one of the girl she must come with them , and show them the place where they have leave Dschemila .
They find the bundle of wood lie where she have drop it , but the maiden be nowhere to be see .
` Dschemila !
Dschemila ! '
cry they ; but nobody answer .
` If we make a fire , perhaps she will see it , ' say one of the men .
And they light a fire , and then go , one this way , and one that , through the forest , to look for her , whisper to each other that if she have be kill by a lion they would be sure to find some trace of it ; or if she have fall asleep , the sound of their voice would wake her ; or if a snake have bite her , they would at least come on her corpse .
All night they search , and when morning break and they know no more than before what have become of the maiden , they grow weary , and say to the mother : ` It be no use .
Let u go home , nothing have happen to your daughter , except that she have run away with a man . '
` Yes , I will come , ' answer she , ` but I must first look in the river .
Perhaps some one have throw her in there . '
But the maiden be not in the river .
For four day the father and mother wait and watch for their child to come back ; then they give up hope , and say to each other : ` What be to be do ?
What be we to say to the man to whom Dschemila be betroth ?
Let u kill a goat , and bury it head in the grave , and when the man return we must tell him Dschemila be dead . '
Very soon the bridegroom come back , bring with him carpet and soft cushion for the house of his bride .
And a he enter the town Dschemila 's father meet him , say , ` Greeting to you .
She be dead . '
At these word the young man break into loud cry , and it be some time before he could speak .
Then he turn to one of the crowd who have gather round him , and ask : ` Where have they bury her ? '
` Come to the churchyard with me , ' answer he ; and the young man go with him , carry with him some of the beautiful thing he have bring .
These he lay on the grass and then begin to weep afresh .
All day he stay , and at nightfall he gather up his stuff and carry them to his own house .
But when the day dawn he take them in his arm and return to the grave , where he remain as long a it be light , play softly on his flute .
And this he do daily for six month .
* * * * * One morning , a man who be wander through the desert , have lose his way , come upon a lonely castle .
The sun be very hot , and the man be very tired , so he say to himself , ' I will rest a little in the shadow of this castle . '
He stretch himself out comfortably , and be almost asleep , when he hear a voice call to him softly : ` Are you a ghost , ' it say , ` or a man ? '
He look up , and saw a girl lean out of a window , and he answer : ' I be a man , and a good one , too , than your father or your grandfather . '
` May all good luck be with you , ' say she ; ` but what have bring you into this land of ogre and horror ? '
` Does an ogre really live in this castle ? '
ask he .
` Certainly he do , ' reply the girl , ` and a night be not far off he will be here soon .
So , dear friend , depart quickly , l he return and snap you up for supper . '
` But I be so thirsty ! '
say the man .
` Be kind , and give me some drink , or else I shall die !
Surely , even in this desert there must be some spring ? '
` Well , I have notice that whenever the ogre brings back water he always come from that side ; so if you follow the same direction perhaps you may find some . '
The man jump up at once and be about to start , when the maiden spoke again : ` Tell me , where you be go ? '
` Why do you want to know ? ' '
I have an errand for you ; but tell me first whether you go east or west . ' '
I travel to Damascus . '
` Then do this for me .
As you pass through our village , ask for a man call Dschemil , and say to him : `` Dschemila greets you , from the castle , which lie far away , and be rock by the wind .
In my grave lie only a goat .
So take heart . '' '
And the man promise , and go his way , till he come to a spring of water .
And he drink a great draught and then lay on the bank and sleep quietly .
When he wake he say to himself , ` The maiden do a good deed when she tell me where to find water .
A few hour more , and I should have be dead .
So I will do her bidding , and seek out her native town and the man for whom the message be give . '
For a whole month he travel , till at last he reach the town where Dschemil dwelt , and a luck would have it , there be the young man sit before his door with his beard unshaven and his shaggy hair hang over his eye .
` Welcome , stranger , ' say Dschemil , a the man stop .
` Where have you come from ? ' '
I come from the west , and go towards the east , ' he answer .
` Well , stop with u awhile , and rest and eat ! '
say Dschemil .
And the man enter ; and food be set before him , and he sit down with the father of the maiden and her brother , and Dschemil .
Only Dschemil himself be absent , squat on the threshold .
` Why do you not eat too ? '
ask the stranger .
But one of the young men whisper hastily : ` Leave him alone .
Take no notice !
It be only at night that he ever eat . '
So the stranger go on silently with his food .
Suddenly one of Dschemil 's brother call out and say : ` Dschemil , bring u some water ! '
And the stranger remember his message and say : ` Is there a man here name `` Dschemil '' ?
I lose my way in the desert , and come to a castle , and a maiden look out of the window and -- ' ` Be quiet , ' they cry , fear that Dschemil might hear .
But Dschemil have hear , and come forward and say : ` What do you see ?
Tell me truly , or I will cut off your head this instant ! '
` My lord , ' reply the stranger , ` a I be wander , hot and tired , through the desert , I saw near me a great castle , and I say aloud , `` I will rest a little in it shadow . ''
And a maiden look out of a window and say , `` Are you a ghost or a man ? ''
And I answer .
`` I be a man , and a good one , too , than your father or your grandfather . ''
And I be thirsty and ask for water , but she have none to give me , and I felt like to die .
Then she tell me that the ogre , in whose castle she dwell , bring in water always from the same side , and that if I too go that way most likely I should come to it .
But before I start she beg me to go to her native town , and if I meet a man call Dschemil I be to say to him , `` Dschemila greets you , from the castle which lie far away , and be rock by the wind .
In my grave lie only a goat .
So take heart . '' '
Then Dschemil turn to his family and say : ` Is this true ?
and be Dschemila not dead at all , but simply steal from her home ? '
` No , no , ' reply they , ` his story be a pack of lie .
Dschemila be really dead .
Everybody know it . '
` That I shall see for myself , ' say Dschemil , and , snatch up a spade , hasten off to the grave where the goat 's head lay bury .
And they answer , ` Then hear what really happen .
When you be away , she go with the other maiden to the forest to gather wood .
And there she find an iron mortar , which she wish to bring home ; but she could not carry it , neither would she leave it .
So the maiden return without her , and a night be come , we all set out to look for her , but find nothing .
And we say , `` The bridegroom will be here to-morrow , and when he learn that she be lose , he will set out to seek her , and we shall lose him too .
Let u kill a goat , and bury it in her grave , and tell him she be dead . ''
Now you know , so do a you will .
Only , if you go to seek her , take with you this man with whom she have speak that he may show you the way . '
` Yes ; that be the best plan , ' reply Dschemil ; ` so give me food , and hand me my sword , and we will set out directly . '
But the stranger answer : ' I be not go to waste a whole month in lead you to the castle !
If it be only a day or two 's journey I would not mind ; but a month -- no ! '
` Come with me then for three day , ' say Dschemil , ` and put me in the right road , and I will reward you richly . '
` Very well , ' reply the stranger , ` so let it be . '
For three day they travel from sunrise to sunset , then the stranger say : ` Dschemil ? '
` Yes , ' reply he .
` Go straight on till you reach a spring , then go on a little farther , and soon you will see the castle stand before you . '
` So I will , ' say Dschemil .
` Farewell , then , ' say the stranger , and turn back the way he have come .
It be six and twenty day before Dschemil catch sight of a green spot rise out of the sandy desert , and know that the spring be near at last .
He hasten his step , and soon be kneel by it side , drink thirstily of the bubbling water .
Then he lay down on the cool grass , and begin to think .
` If the man be right , the castle must be somewhere about .
I have well sleep here to-night , and to-morrow I shall be able to see where it be . '
So he sleep long and peacefully .
When he awake the sun be high , and he jump up and wash his face and hand in the spring , before go on his journey .
He have not walk far , when the castle suddenly appear before him , though a moment before not a trace of it could be see .
` How be I to get in ? '
he think . '
I dare not knock , l the ogre should hear me .
Perhaps it would be best for me to climb up the wall , and wait to see what will happen . '
So he do , and after sit on the top for about an hour , a window above him open , and a voice say : ` Dschemil ! '
He look up , and at the sight of Dschemila , whom he have so long believe to be dead , he begin to weep .
` Dear cousin , ' she whisper , ` what have bring you here ? '
` My grief at lose you . '
` Oh !
go away at once .
If the ogre come back he will kill you . ' '
I swear by your head , queen of my heart , that I have not find you only to lose you again !
If I must die , well , I must ! '
` Oh , what can I do for you ? '
` Anything you like ! '
` If I let you down a cord , can you make it fast under your arm , and climb up ? '
` Of course I can , ' say he .
So Dschemila lower the cord , and Dschemil tie it round him , and climb up to her window .
Then they embrace each other tenderly , and burst into tear of joy .
` But what shall I do when the ogre return ? '
ask she .
` Trust to me , ' he say .
Now there be a chest in the room , where Dschemila keep her clothes .
And she make Dschemil get into it , and lie at the bottom , and tell him to keep very still .
He be only hidden just in time , for the lid be hardly close when the ogre 's heavy tread be hear on the stair .
He fling open the door , bring men 's flesh for himself and lamb 's flesh for the maiden . '
I smell the smell of a man ! '
he thunder .
` What be he do here ? '
` How could any one have come to this desert place ? '
ask the girl , and burst into tear .
` Do not cry , ' say the ogre ; ` perhaps a raven have drop some scrap from his claw . '
` Ah , yes , I be forget , ' answer she .
` One do drop some bone about . '
` Well , burn them to powder , ' reply the ogre , ` so that I may swallow it . '
So the maiden take some bone and burn them , and give them to the ogre , say , ` Here be the powder , swallow it . '
And when he have swallow the powder the ogre stretch himself out and go to sleep .
In a little while the man 's flesh , which the maiden be cook for the ogre 's supper , call out and say : ` Hist !
Hist !
A man lie in the kist ! '
And the lamb 's flesh answer : ` He be your brother , And cousin of the other . '
The ogre move sleepily , and ask , ` What do the meat say , Dschemila ? '
` Only that I must be sure to add salt . '
` Well , add salt . '
` Yes , I have do so , ' say she .
The ogre be soon sound asleep again , when the man 's flesh call out a second time : ` Hist !
Hist !
A man lie in the kist ! '
And the lamb 's flesh answer : ` He be your brother , And cousin of the other . '
` What do it say , Dschemila ? '
ask the ogre .
` Only that I must add pepper . '
` Well , add pepper . '
` Yes , I have do so , ' say she .
The ogre have have a long day 's hunting , and could not keep himself awake .
In a moment his eye be tight shut , and then the man 's flesh call out for the third time : ` Hist !

-LSB- Illustration : DSCHEMILA-OUTWITS-THE-OGRE -RSB- And the lamb 's flesh answer : ` He be your brother , And cousin of the other . '
` What do it say , Dschemila ? '
ask the ogre .
` Only that it be ready , and that I have well take it off the fire . '
` Then if it be ready , bring it to me , and I will eat it . '
So she bring it to him , and while he be eat she sup of the lamb 's flesh herself , and manage to put some aside for her cousin .
When the ogre have finish , and have wash his hand , he say to Dschemila : ` Make my bed , for I be tired . '
So she make his bed , and put a nice soft pillow for his head , and tuck him up .
` Father , ' she say suddenly .
` Well , what be it ? '
` Dear father , if you be really asleep , why be your eye always open ? '
` Why do you ask that , Dschemila ?
Do you want to deal treacherously with me ? '
` No , of course not , father .
How could I , and what would be the use of it ? '
` Well , why do you want to know ? '
` Because last night I wake up and saw the whole place shin in a red light , which frighten me . '
` That happen when I be fast asleep . '
` And what be the good of the pin you always keep here so carefully ? '
` If I throw that pin in front of me , it turn into an iron mountain . '
` And this darn needle ? '
` That become a sea . '
` And this hatchet ? '
` That become a thorn hedge , which no one can pass through .
But why do you ask all these question ?
I be sure you have something in your head . '
` Oh , I just want to know ; and how could anyone find me out here ? '
and she begin to cry .
` Oh , do n't cry , I be only in fun , ' say the ogre .
He be soon asleep again , and a yellow light shone through the castle .
` Come quick ! '
call Dschemil from the chest ; ` we must fly now while the ogre be asleep . '
` Not yet , ' she say , ` there be a yellow light shin .
I do n't think he be asleep . '
So they wait for an hour .
Then Dschemil whisper again : ` Wake up !
There be no time to lose ! '
` Let me see if he be asleep , ' say she , and she peep in , and saw a red light shin .
Then she steal back to her cousin , and ask , ` But how be we to get out ? '
` Get the rope , and I will let you down . '
So she fetch the rope , the hatchet , and the pin and the needle , and say , ` Take them , and put them in the pocket of your cloak , and be sure not to lose them . '
Dschemil put them carefully in his pocket , and tie the rope round her , and let her down over the wall .
` Are you safe ? '
he ask .
` Yes , quite . '
` Then untie the rope , so that I may draw it up . '
And Dschemila do a she be tell , and in a few minute he stand beside her .
Now all this time the ogre be asleep , and have hear nothing .
Then his dog come to him and say , ` O , sleeper , be you have pleasant dream ?
Dschemila have forsake you and run away . '
The ogre get out of bed , give the dog a kick , then go back again , and sleep till morning .
When it grow light , he rise , and call , ` Dschemila !
Dschemila ! '
but he only hear the echo of his own voice !
Then he dress himself quickly ; buckle on his sword and whistle to his dog , and follow the road which he know the fugitive must have take .
` Cousin , ' say Dschemila suddenly , and turn round a she speak .
` What be it ? '
answer he .
` The ogre be come after u .
I saw him . '
` But where be he ?
I do n't see him . '
` Over there .
He only look about as tall a a needle . '
Then they both begin to run as fast a they could , while the ogre and his dog keep draw always nearer .
A few more step , and he would have be by their side , when Dschemila throw the darning needle behind her .
In a moment it become an iron mountain between them and their enemy .
` We will break it down , my dog and I , ' cry the ogre in a rage , and they dash at the mountain till they have force a path through , and come ever near and nearer .
` Cousin ! '
say Dschemila suddenly .
` What be it ? '
` The ogre be come after u with his dog . '
` You go on in front then , ' answer he ; and they both run on as fast a they could , while the ogre and the dog draw always near and nearer .
` They be close upon u ! '
cry the maiden , glance behind , ` you must throw the pin . '
So Dschemil take the pin from his cloak and throw it behind him , and a dense thicket of thorn spring up round them , which the ogre and his dog could not pass through . '
I will get through it somehow , if I burrow underground , ' cry he , and very soon he and the dog be on the other side .
` Cousin , ' say Dschemila , ` they be close to u now . '
` Go on in front , and fear nothing , ' reply Dschemil .
So she run on a little way , and then stop .
` He be only a few yard away now , ' she say , and Dschemil fling the hatchet on the ground , and it turn into a lake . '
I will drink , and my dog shall drink , till it be dry , ' shriek the ogre , and the dog drink so much that it burst and die .
But the ogre do not stop for that , and soon the whole lake be nearly dry .
Then he exclaim , ` Dschemila , let your head become a donkey 's head , and your hair fur ! '
-LSB- Illustration : DSCHEMILA GETS AN ASS 'S HEAD -RSB- But when it be do , Dschemil look at her in horror , and say , ` She be really a donkey , and not a woman at all ! '
And he leave her , and go home .
For two day poor Dschemila wander about alone , weep bitterly .
When her cousin draw near his native town , he begin to think over his conduct , and to feel ashamed of himself .
` Perhaps by this time she have change back to her proper shape , ' he say to himself , ' I will go and see ! '
So he make all the haste he could , and at last he saw her seat on a rock , try to keep off the wolf , who long to have her for dinner .
He drive them off and say , ` Get up , dear cousin , you have have a narrow escape . '
Dschemila stand up and answer , ` Bravo , my friend .
You persuade me to fly with you , and then leave me helplessly to my fate . '
` Shall I tell you the truth ? '
ask he .
` Tell it . ' '
I think you be a witch , and I be afraid of you . '
` Did you not see me before my transformation ?
and do you not watch it happen under your very eyes , when the ogre bewitch me ? '
` What shall I do ? '
say Dschemil .
` If I take you into the town , everyone will laugh , and say , `` Is that a new kind of toy you have get ?
It have hand like a woman , foot like a woman , the body of a woman ; but it head be the head of an as , and it hair be fur . '' '
` Well , what do you mean to do with me ? '
ask Dschemila .
` Better take me home to my mother by night , and tell no one anything about it . '
` So I will , ' say he .
They wait where they be till it be nearly dark , then Dschemil bring his cousin home .
` Is that Dschemil ? '
ask the mother when he knock softly .
` Yes , it be . '
` And have you find her ? '
` Yes , and I have bring her to you . '
` Oh , where be she ?
let me see her ! '
cry the mother .
` Here , behind me , ' answer Dschemil .
But when the poor woman catch sight of her daughter , she shriek , and exclaim , ` Are you make fun of me ?
When do I ever give birth to an as ? '
` Hush ! '
say Dschemil , ` it be not necessary to let the whole world know !
And if you look at her body , you will see two scar on it . '
` Mother , ' sob Dschemila , ` do you really not know your own daughter ? '
` Yes , of course I know her . '
` What be her two scar then ? '
` On her thigh be a scar from the bite of a dog , and on her breast be the mark of a burn , where she pull a lamp over her when she be little . '
` Then look at me , and see if I be not your daughter , ' say Dschemila , throw off her clothes and show her two scar .
And at the sight her mother embrace her , weep .
` Dear daughter , ' she cry , ` what evil fate have befall you ? '
` It be the ogre who carry me off first , and then bewitch me , ' answer Dschemila .
` But what be to be do with you ? '
ask her mother .
` Hide me away , and tell no one anything about me .
And you , dear cousin , say nothing to the neighbour , and if they should put question , you can make answer that I have not yet be find . '
` So I will , ' reply he .
Then he and her mother take her upstairs and hide her in a cupboard , where she stay for a whole month , only go out to walk when all the world be asleep .
Meanwhile Dschemil have return to his own home , where his father and mother , his brother and neighbour , greet him joyfully .
` When do you come back ? '
say they , ` and have you find Dschemila ? '
` No , I search the whole world after her , and could hear nothing of her . '
` Did you part company with the man who start with you ? '
` Yes ; after three day he get so weak and useless he could not go on .
It must be a month by now since he reach home again .
I go on and visit every castle , and look in every house .
But there be no sign of her ; and so I give it up . '
And they answer him : ` We tell you before that it be no good .
An ogre or an ogress must have snap her up , and how can you expect to find her ? ' '
I love her too much to be still , ' he say .
But his friend do not understand , and soon they speak to him again about it .
` We will seek for a wife for you .
There be plenty of girl pretty than Dschemila . ' '
I dare say ; but I do n't want them . '
` But what will you do with all the cushion and carpet , and beautiful thing you buy for your house ? '
` They can stay in the chest . '
` But the moth will eat them !
For a few week , it be of no consequence , but after a year or two they will be quite useless . '
` And if they have to lie there ten year I will have Dschemila , and her only , for my wife .
For a month , or even two month , I will rest here quietly .
Then I will go and seek her afresh . '
` Oh , you be quite mad !
Is she the only maiden in the world ?
There be plenty of others well worth have than she be . '
` If there be I have not see them !
And why do you make all this fuss ?
Every man know his own business best . '
` Why , it be you who be make all the fuss yourself -- ' But Dschemil turn and go into the house , for he do not want to quarrel .
Three month later a Jew , who be travel across the desert , come to the castle , and lay himself down under the wall to rest .
In the even the ogre saw him there and say to him , ` Jew , what be you do here ?
Have you anything to sell ? ' '
I have only some clothes , ' answer the Jew , who be in mortal terror of the ogre .
` Oh , do n't be afraid of me , ' say the ogre , laugh . '
I shall not eat you .
Indeed , I mean to go a bit of the way with you myself . ' '
I be ready , gracious sir , ' reply the Jew , rise to his foot .
` Well , go straight on till you reach a town , and in that town you will find a maiden call Dschemila and a young man call Dschemil .
Take this mirror and this comb with you , and say to Dschemila , `` Your father , the ogre , greets you , and beg you to look at your face in this mirror , and it will appear a it be before , and to comb your hair with this comb , and it will be a formerly . ''
If you do not carry out my order , I will eat you the next time we meet . '
` Oh , I will obey you punctually , ' cry the Jew .
After thirty day the Jew enter the gate of the town , and sit down in the first street he come to , hungry , thirsty , and very tired .
Quite by chance , Dschemil happen to pass by , and see a man sit there , full in the glare of the sun , he stop , and say , ` Get up at once , Jew ; you will have a sunstroke if you sit in such a place . '
` Ah , good sir , ' reply the Jew , ` for a whole month I have be travel , and I be too tire to move . '
` Which way do you come ? '
ask Dschemil .
` From out there , ' answer the Jew , point behind him .
` And you have be travel for a month , you say ?
Well , do you see anything remarkable ? '
` Yes , good sir ; I saw a castle , and lay down to rest under it shadow .
And an ogre wake me , and tell me to come to this town , where I should find a young man call Dschemil , and a girl call Dschemila . '
` My name be Dschemil .
What do the ogre want with me ? '
` He give me some present for Dschemila .
How can I see her ? '
` Come with me , and you shall give them into her own hand . '
So the two go together to the house of Dschemil 's uncle , and Dschemil lead the Jew into his aunt 's room .
` Aunt ! '
he cry , ` this Jew who be with me have come from the ogre , and have bring with him , a present , a mirror and a comb which the ogre have send her . '
` But it may be only some wicked trick on the part of the ogre , ' say she .
` Oh , I do n't think so , ' answer the young man , ` give her the thing . '
Then the maiden be call , and she come out of her hiding place , and go up to the Jew , say , ` Where have you come from , Jew ? '
` From your father the ogre . '
` And what errand do he send you on ? '
` He tell me I be to give you this mirror and this comb , and to say `` Look in this mirror , and comb your hair with this comb , and both will become a they be formerly . '' '
And Dschemila take the mirror and look into it , and comb her hair with the comb , and she have no longer an as 's head , but the face of a beautiful maiden .

THE PARTNERSHIP OF THE THIEF AND THE LIAR .
There be once upon a time a thief , who , be out of a job , be wander by himself up and down the seashore .
As he walk he pass a man who be stand still , look at the wave . '
I wonder , ' say the thief , address the stranger , ` if you have ever see a stone swimming ? '
` Most certainly I have , ' reply the other man , ` and , what be more , I saw the same stone jump out of the water and fly through the air . '
` This be capital , ' reply the thief .
` You and I must go into partnership .
We shall certainly make our fortune .
Let u start together for the palace of the king of the neighbouring country .
When we get there , I will go into his presence alone , and will tell him the most startling thing I can invent .
Then you must follow and back up my lie . '
Having agree to do this , they set out on their travel .
After several day ' journeying , they reach the town where the king 's palace be , and here they part for a few hour , while the thief seek an interview with the king , and beg his majesty to give him a glass of beer .
` That be impossible , ' say the king , ` a this year there have be a failure of all the crop , and of the hop and the vine ; so we have neither wine nor beer in the whole kingdom . '
` How extraordinary ! '
answer the thief . '
I have just come from a country where the crop be so fine that I saw twelve barrel of beer make out of one branch of hop . ' '
I bet you three hundred florin that be not true , ' answer the king .
` And I bet you three hundred florin it be true , ' reply the thief .
Then each stake his three hundred florin , and the king say he would decide the question by send a servant into that country to see if it be true .
So the servant set out on horseback , and on the way he meet a man , and he ask him whence he come .
And the man tell him that he come from the self-same country to which the servant be at that moment bound .
` If that be the case , ' say the servant , ` you can tell me how high the hop grow in your country , and how many barrel of beer can be brew from one branch ? ' '
I ca n't tell you that , ' answer the man , ` but I happen to be present when the hop be be gather in , and I saw that it take three men with ax three day to cut down one branch . '
Then the servant think that he might save himself a long journey ; so he give the man ten florins , and tell him he must repeat to the king what he have just tell him .
And when they get back to the palace , they come together into the king 's presence .
And the king ask him : ` Well , be it true about the hop ? '
` Yes , sire , it be , ' answer the servant ; ` and here be a man I have bring with me from the country to confirm the tale . '
So the king pay the thief the three hundred florin ; and the partner once more set out together in search of adventure .
As they journey , the thief say to his comrade : ' I will now go to another king , and will tell him something still more startling ; and you must follow and back up my lie , and we shall get some money out of him ; just see if we do n't . '
When they reach the next kingdom , the thief present himself to the king , and request him to give him a cauliflower .
And the king answer : ` Owing to a blight among the vegetable we have no cauliflower . '
` That be strange , ' answer the thief . '
I have just come from a country where it grow so well that one head of cauliflower fill twelve water-tubs . ' '
I do n't believe it , ' answer the king . '
I bet you six hundred florin it be true , ' reply the thief .
` And I bet you six hundred florin it be not true , ' answer the king .
And he send for a servant , and order him to start at once for the country whence the thief have come , to find out if his story of the cauliflower be true .
On his journey the servant met with a man .
Stopping his horse he ask him where he come from , and the man reply that he come from the country to which the other be travel .
` If that be the case , ' say the servant , ` you can tell me to what size cauliflower grows in your country ?
Is it so large that one head fill twelve water-tubs ? ' '
I have not see that , ' answer the man .
` But I saw twelve waggon , draw by twelve horse , carry one head of cauliflower to the market . '
And the servant answer : ` Here be ten florin for you , my man , for you have save me a long journey .
Come with me now , and tell the king what you have just tell me . '
` All right , ' say the man , and they go together to the palace ; and when the king ask the servant if he have find out the truth about the cauliflower , the servant reply : ` Sire , all that you hear be perfectly true ; here be a man from the country who will tell you so . '
So the king have to pay the thief the six hundred florin .
And the two partner set out once more on their travel , with their nine hundred florin .
When they reach the country of the neighbouring king , the thief enter the royal presence , and begin conversation by ask if his majesty know that in an adjacent kingdom there be a town with a church steeple on which a bird have alight , and that the steeple be so high , and the bird 's beak so long , that it have peck the star till some of them fell out of the sky . '
I do n't believe it , ' say the king .
` Nevertheless I be prepared to bet twelve hundred florins that it be true , ' answer the thief .
` And I bet twelve hundred florin that it be a lie , ' reply the king .
And he straightway send a servant into the neighbouring country to find out the truth .
As he ride , the servant meet a man come in the opposite direction .
So he hail him and ask him where he come from .
And the man reply that he come out of the very town to which the man be bind .
Then the servant ask him if the story they have hear about the bird with the long beak be true . '
I do n't know about that , ' answer the man , ` a I have never see the bird ; but I once saw twelve men shove all their might and main with broom to push a monster egg into a cellar . '
-LSB- Illustration : `` I once saw '' 12 MEN SHOVING ALL THEIR MIGHT AND MAIN WITH BROOMS TO PUSH A MONSTER EGG INTO A CELLAR -RSB- ` That be capital , ' answer the servant , present the man with ten florin .
` Come and tell your tale to the king , and you will save me a long journey . '
So , when the story be repeat to the king , there be nothing for him to do but to pay the thief the twelve hundred florin .
Then the two partner set out again with their ill-gotten gain , which they proceed to divide into two equal share ; but the thief keep back three of the florin that belong to the liar 's half of the booty .
Shortly afterwards they each marry , and settle down in home of their own with their wife .
One day the liar discover that he have be do out of three florin by his partner , so he go to his house and demand them from him .
` Come next Saturday , and I will give them to you , ' answer the thief .
But a he have no intention of give the liar the money , when Saturday morning come he stretch himself out stiff and stark upon the bed , and tell his wife she be to say he be dead .
So the wife rub her eye with an onion , and when the liar appear at the door , she meet him in tear , and tell him that a her husband be dead he could not be pay the three florin .
But the liar , who know his partner 's trick , instantly suspect the truth , and say : ` As he have not pay me , I will pay him out with three good lash of my rid whip . '
At these word the thief sprang to his foot , and , appear at the door , promise his partner that if he would return the following Saturday he would pay him .
So the liar go away satisfy with this promise .
But when Saturday morning come the thief get up early and hide himself under a truss of hay in the hay-loft .
When the liar appear to demand his three florin , the wife meet him with tear in her eye , and tell him that her husband be dead .
` Where have you bury him ? '
ask the liar .
` In the hay-loft , ' answer the wife .
` Then I will go there , and take away some hay in payment of his debt , ' say the liar .
And proceed to the hay-loft , he begin to toss about the hay with a pitch-fork , prod it into the truss of hay , till , in terror of his life , the thief creep out and promise his partner to pay him the three florin on the following Saturday .
When the day come he get up at sunrise , and go down into the crypt of a neighbouring chapel , stretch himself out quite still and stiff in an old stone coffin .
But the liar , who be quite as clever a his partner , very soon bethink him of the crypt , and set out for the chapel , confident that he would shortly discover the hiding-place of his friend .
He have just enter the crypt , and his eye be not yet accustom to the darkness , when he hear the sound of whisper at the grated window .
Listening intently , he overhear the plotting of a band of robber , who have bring their treasure to the crypt , mean to hide it there , while they set out on fresh adventure .
All the time they be speak they be remove the bar from the window , and in another minute they would all have enter the crypt , and discover the liar .
Quick a thought he wind his mantle round him and place himself , stand stiff and erect , in a niche in the wall , so that in the dim light he look just like an old stone statue .
As soon a the robber enter the crypt , they set about the work of divide their treasure .
Now , there be twelve robber , but by mistake the chief of the band divide the gold into thirteen heap .
When he saw his mistake he say they have not time to count it all over again , but that the thirteenth heap should belong to whoever among them could strike off the head of the old stone statue in the niche with one stroke .
With these word he take up an axe , and approach the niche where the liar be stand .
But , just a he have wave the axe over his head ready to strike , a voice be hear from the stone coffin say , in sepulchral tone : ` Clear out of this , or the dead will arise from their coffin , and the statue will descend from the wall , and you will be drive out more dead than alive . '
And with a bound the thief jump out of his coffin and the liar from his niche , and the robber be so terrify that they run helter-skelter out of the crypt , leave all their gold behind them , and vow that they would never put foot inside the haunted place again .
So the partner divide the gold between them , and carry it to their home ; and history tell u no more about them .
FORTUNATUS AND HIS PURSE Once upon a time there live in the city of Famagosta , in the island of Cyprus , a rich man call Theodorus .
He ought to have be the happy person in the whole world , a he have all he could wish for , and a wife and little son whom he love dearly ; but unluckily , after a short time he always grow tired of everything , and have to seek new pleasure .
When people be make like this the end be generally the same , and before Fortunatus -LRB- for that be the boy 's name -RRB- be ten year old , his father have spend all his money and have not a farthing left .
But though Theodorus have be so foolish he be not quite without sense , and set about get work at once .
His wife , too , instead of reproach him send away the servant and sell their fine horse , and do all the work of the house herself , even wash the clothes of her husband and child .
Thus time pass till Fortunatus be sixteen .
One day when they be sit at supper , the boy say to Theodorus , ` Father , why do you look so sad ?
Tell me what be wrong , and perhaps I can help you . '
` Ah , my son , I have reason enough to be sad ; but for me you would now have be enjoy every kind of pleasure , instead of be bury in this tiny house . '
` Oh , do not let that trouble you , ' reply Fortunatus , ` it be time I make some money for myself .
To be sure I have never be teach any trade .
Still there must be something I can do .
I will go and walk on the seashore and think about it . '
Very soon -- sooner than he expect -- a chance come , and Fortunatus , like a wise boy , seize on it at once .
The post offer him be that of page to the Earl of Flanders , and a the Earl 's daughter be just go to be marry , splendid festivity be hold in her honour , and at some of the tilting match Fortunatus be lucky enough to win the prize .
These prize , together with present from the lord and lady of the court , who like him for his pleasant way , make Fortunatus feel quite a rich man .
But though his head be not turn by the notice take of him , it excite the envy of some of the other page about the Court , and one of them , call Robert , invent a plot to move Fortunatus out of his way .
So he tell the young man that the Earl have take a dislike to him and mean to kill him ; Fortunatus believe the story , and pack up his fine clothes and money , slip away before dawn .
He go to a great many big town and live well , and a he be generous and not wise than most youth of his age , he very soon find himself penniless .
Like his father , he then begin to think of work , and tramp half over Brittany in search of it .
Nobody seem to want him , and he wander about from one place to another , till he find himself in a dense wood , without any path , and not much light .
Here he spend two whole day , with nothing to eat and very little water to drink , go first in one direction and then in another , but never be able to find his way out .
During the first night he sleep soundly , and be too tired to fear either man or beast , but when darkness come on for the second time , and growl be hear in the distance , he grow frightened and look about for a high tree out of reach of his enemy .
Hardly have he settle himself comfortably in one of the forked branch , when a lion walk up to a spring that burst from a rock close to the tree , and crouch down drank greedily .
This be bad enough , but after all , lion do not climb tree , and as long a Fortunatus stay up on his perch , he be quite safe .
But no sooner be the lion out of sight , than his place be take by a bear , and bear , a Fortunatus know very well , be tree-climbers .
His heart beat fast , and not without reason , for a the bear turn away he look up and saw Fortunatus !
Now in those day every young man carry a sword slung to his belt , and it be a fashion that come in very handily for Fortunatus .
He draw his sword , and when the bear get within a yard of him he make a fierce lunge forward .
The bear , wild with pain , try to spring , but the bough he be stand on broke with his weight , and he fell heavily to the ground .
Then Fortunatus descend from his tree -LRB- first take good care to see no other wild animal be in sight -RRB- and kill him with a single blow .
He be just think he would light a fire and make a hearty dinner off bear 's flesh , which be not at all bad eating , when he behold a beautiful lady standing by his side lean on a wheel , and her eye hide by a bandage . '
I be Dame Fortune , ' she say , ` and I have a gift for you .
Shall it be wisdom , strength , long life , rich , health , or beauty ?
Think well , and tell me what you will have . '
But Fortunatus , who have prove the truth of the proverb that ` It 's ill think on an empty stomach , ' answer quickly , ` Good lady , let me have rich in such plenty that I may never again be as hungry a I be now . '
And the lady hold out a purse and tell him he have only to put his hand into it , and he and his child would always find ten piece of gold .
But when they be dead it would be a magic purse no longer .
-LSB- Illustration : THE GIFT-OF-FORTUNE -RSB- At this news Fortunatus be beside himself with joy , and could hardly find word to thank the lady .
But she tell him that the best thing he could do be to find his way out of the wood , and before bidding him farewell point out which path he should take .
He walk along it a fast a his weakness would let him , until a welcome light at a little distance show him that a house be near .
It turn out to be an inn , but before enter Fortunatus think he have well make sure of the truth of what the lady have tell him , and take out the purse and look inside .
Sure enough there be the ten piece of gold , shin brightly .
Then Fortunatus walk boldly up to the inn , and order them to get ready a good supper at once , a he be very hungry , and to bring him the best wine in the house .
And he seem to care so little what he spend that everybody think he be a great lord , and vie with each other who should run quickest when he call .
After a night pass in a soft bed , Fortunatus felt so much good that he ask the landlord if he could find him some men-servants , and tell him where any good horse be to be get .
The next thing be to provide himself with smart clothes , and then to take a big house where he could give great feast to the noble and beautiful lady who live in palace round about .
In this manner a whole year soon slip away , and Fortunatus be so busy amuse himself that he never once remember his parent whom he have leave behind in Cyprus .
But though he be thoughtless , he be not bad-hearted .
As soon a their existence cross his mind , he set about make preparation to visit them , and a he be not fond of be alone he look round for some one old and wise than himself to travel with him .
It be not long before he have the good luck to come across an old man who have leave his wife and child in a far country many year before , when he go out into the world to seek the fortune which he never find .
He agree to accompany Fortunatus back to Cyprus , but only on condition he should first be allow to return for a few week to his own home before venture to set sail for an island so strange and distant .
Fortunatus agree to his proposal , and a he be always fond of anything new , say that he would go with him .
The journey be long , and they have to cross many large river , and climb over high mountain , and find their way through thick wood , before they reach at length the old man 's castle .
His wife and child have almost give up hope of see him again , and crowd eagerly round him .
Indeed , it do not take Fortunatus five minute to fall in love with the young daughter , the most beautiful creature in the whole world , whose name be Cassandra .
` Give her to me for my wife , ' he say to the old man , ` and let u all go together to Famagosta . '
So a ship be buy big enough to hold Fortunatus , the old man and his wife , and their ten child -- five of them son and five daughter .
And the day before they sail the wedding be celebrate with magnificent rejoicing , and everybody think that Fortunatus must certainly be a prince in disguise .
But when they reach Cyprus , he learn to his sorrow that both his father and mother be dead , and for some time he shut himself up in his house and would see nobody , full of shame at have forget them all these year .
Then he beg that the old man and his wife would remain with him , and take the place of his parent .
For twelve year Fortunatus and Cassandra and their two little boy live happily in Famagosta .
They have a beautiful house and everything they could possibly want , and when Cassandra 's sister marry the purse provide them each with a fortune .
But at last Fortunatus grow tire of stay at home , and think he should like to go out and see the world again .
Cassandra shed many tear at first when he tell her of his wish , and he have a great deal of trouble to persuade her to give her consent .
But on his promising to return at the end of two year she agree to let him go .
Before he go away he show her three chest of gold , which stand in a room with an iron door , and wall twelve foot thick .
` If anything should happen to me , ' he say , ` and I should never come back , keep one of the chest for yourself , and give the others to our two son . '
Then he embrace them all and take ship for Alexandria .
The wind be fair and in a few day they enter the harbour , where Fortunatus be inform by a man whom he meet on landing , that if he wish to be well receive in the town , he must begin by make a handsome present to the Sultan .
` That be easily do , ' say Fortunatus , and go into a goldsmith 's shop , where he buy a large gold cup , which cost five thousand pound .
This gift so please the Sultan that he order a hundred cask of spice to be give to Fortunatus ; Fortunatus put them on board his ship , and command the captain to return to Cyprus and deliver them to his wife , Cassandra .
He next obtain an audience of the Sultan , and beg permission to travel through the country , which the Sultan readily give him , add some letter to the ruler of other land which Fortunatus might wish to visit .
Filled with delight at feel himself free to roam through the world once more , Fortunatus set out on his journey without lose a day .
From court to court he go , astonish everyone by the magnificence of his dress and the splendour of his present .
At length he grow as tired of wander a he have be of stay at home , and return to Alexandria , where he find the same ship that have bring him from Cyprus lie in the harbour .
Of course the first thing he do be to pay his respect to the Sultan , who be eager to hear about his adventure .
When Fortunatus have tell them all , the Sultan observe : ` Well , you have see many wonderful thing , but I have something to show you more wonderful still ; ' and he lead him into a room where precious stone lay heap against the wall .
Fortunatus ' eye be quite dazzle , but the Sultan go on without pause and open a door at the farther end .
As far a Fortunatus could see , the cupboard be quite bare , except for a little red cap , such a soldier wear in Turkey .
` Look at this , ' say the Sultan .
` But there be nothing very valuable about it , ' answer Fortunatus .
` I 've see a dozen well cap than that , this very day . '
` Ah , ' say the Sultan , ` you do not know what you be talk about .
Whoever put this cap on his head and wish himself in any place , will find himself there in a moment . '
` But who make it ? '
ask Fortunatus .
` That I can not tell you , ' reply the Sultan .
` Is it very heavy to wear ? '
ask Fortunatus .
` No , quite light , ' reply the Sultan , ` just feel it . '
Fortunatus take the cap and put it on his head , and then , without thinking , wish himself back in the ship that be start for Famagosta .
In a second he be stand at the prow , while the anchor be be weigh , and while the Sultan be repent of his folly in allow Fortunatus to try on the cap , the vessel be make fast for Cyprus .
When it arrive , Fortunatus find his wife and child well , but the two old people be dead and bury .
His son have grow tall and strong , but unlike their father have no wish to see the world , and find their chief pleasure in hunt and tilt .
In the main , Fortunatus be content to stay quietly at home , and if a restless fit do seize upon him , he be able to go away for a few hour without be miss , thanks to the cap , which he never send back to the Sultan .
By-and-by he grow old , and feeling that he have not many day to live , he send for his two son , and show them the purse and cap , he say to them : ` Never part with these precious possession .
They be worth more than all the gold and land I leave behind me .
But never tell their secret , even to your wife or dear friend .
That purse have serve me well for forty year , and no one know whence I get my rich . '
Then he die and be bury by his wife Cassandra , and he be mourn in Famagosta for many year .
THE GOAT-FACED GIRL There be once upon a time a peasant call Masaniello who have twelve daughter .
They be exactly like the step of a staircase , for there be just a year between each sister .
It be all the poor man could do to bring up such a large family , and in order to provide food for them he use to dig in the field all day long .
In spite of his hard work he only just succeed in keep the wolf from the door , and the poor little girl often go hungry to bed .
One day , when Masaniello be work at the foot of a high mountain , he come upon the mouth of a cave which be so dark and gloomy that even the sun seem afraid to enter it .
Suddenly a huge green lizard appear from the inside and stand before Masaniello , who nearly go out of his mind with terror , for the beast be as big a a crocodile and quite a fierce look .
But the lizard sit down beside him in the most friendly manner , and say : ` Do n't be afraid , my good man , I be not go to hurt you ; on the contrary , I be most anxious to help you . '
When the peasant heard these word he kneel before the lizard and say : ` Dear lady , for I know not what to call you , I be in your power ; but I beg of you to be merciful , for I have twelve wretched little daughter at home who be dependent on me . '
` That 's the very reason why I have come to you , ' reply the lizard .
` Bring me your young daughter to-morrow morning .
I promise to bring her up a if she be my own child , and to look upon her a the apple of my eye . '
When Masaniello hear her word he be very unhappy , because he felt sure , from the lizard 's want one of his daughter , the young and tenderest too , that the poor little girl would only serve a dessert for the terrible creature 's supper .
At the same time he say to himself , ` If I refuse her request , she will certainly eat me up on the spot .
If I give her what she ask she do indeed take part of myself , but if I refuse she will take the whole of me .
What be I to do , and how in the world be I to get out of the difficulty ? '
As he keep mutter to himself the lizard say , ` Make up your mind to do a I tell you at once .
I desire to have your young daughter , and if you wo n't comply with my wish , I can only say it will be the bad for you . '
Seeing that there be nothing else to be do , Masaniello set off for his home , and arrive there look so white and wretched that his wife ask him at once : ` What have happen to you , my dear husband ?
Have you quarrel with anyone , or have the poor donkey fall down ? '
` Neither the one nor the other , ' answer her husband , ` but something far bad than either .
A terrible lizard have nearly frighten me out of my sens , for she threaten that if I do not give her our young daughter , she would make me repent it .
My head be go round like a mill-wheel , and I do n't know what to do .
I be indeed between the Devil and the Deep Sea .
You know how dearly I love Renzolla , and yet , if I fail to bring her to the lizard to-morrow morning , I must say farewell to life .
Do advise me what to do . '
When his wife have hear all he have to say , she say to him : ` How do you know , my dear husband , that the lizard be really our enemy ?
May she not be a friend in disguise ?
And your meeting with her may be the beginning of good thing and the end of all our misery .
Therefore go and take the child to her , for my heart tell me that you will never repent do so . '
Masaniello be much comfort by her word , and next morning as soon a it be light he take his little daughter by the hand and lead her to the cave .
The lizard , who be await the peasant 's arrival , come forward to meet him , and take the girl by the hand , she give the father a sack full of gold , and say : ` Go and marry your other daughter , and give them dowry with this gold , and be of good cheer , for Renzolla will have both father and mother in me ; it be a great piece of luck for her that she have fall into my hand . '
-LSB- Illustration : The Lizard take charge of Renzolla -RSB- Masaniello , quite overcome with gratitude , thank the lizard , and return home to his wife .
As soon a it be know how rich the peasant have become , suitor for the hand of his daughter be not want , and very soon he marry them all off ; and even then there be enough gold leave to keep himself and his wife in comfort and plenty all their day .
As soon a the lizard be leave alone with Renzolla , she change the cave into a beautiful palace , and lead the girl inside .
Here she bring her up like a little princess , and the child want for nothing .
She give her sumptuous food to eat , beautiful clothes to wear , and a thousand servant to wait on her .
Now , it happen , one day , that the king of the country be hunt in a wood close to the palace , and be overtake by the dark .
Seeing a light shining in the palace he send one of his servant to ask if he could get a night 's lodging there .
When the page knock at the door the lizard change herself into a beautiful woman , and open it herself .
When she hear the king 's request she send him a message to say that she would be delight to see him , and give him all he want .
The king , on hear this kind invitation , instantly betook himself to the palace , where he be receive in the most hospitable manner .
A hundred page with torch come to meet him , a hundred more wait on him at table , and another hundred wave big fan in the air to keep the fly from him .
Renzolla herself pour out the wine for him , and , so gracefully do she do it , that his Majesty could not take his eye off her .
When the meal be finish and the table clear , the king retire to sleep , and Renzolla draw the shoe from his foot , at the same time draw his heart from his breast .
So desperately have he fall in love with her , that he call the fairy to him , and ask her for Renzolla 's hand in marriage .
As the kind fairy have only the girl 's welfare at heart , she willingly give her consent , and not her consent only , but a wedding portion of seven thousand golden guinea .
The king , full of delight over his good fortune , prepare to take his departure , accompany by Renzolla , who never so much a thank the fairy for all she have do for her .
When the fairy saw such a base want of gratitude she determine to punish the girl , and , curse her , she turn her face into a goat 's head .
In a moment Renzolla 's pretty mouth stretch out into a snout , with a beard a yard long at the end of it , her cheek sank in , and her shin plait of hair change into two sharp horn .
When the king turn round and saw her he think he must have take leave of his sens .
He burst into tear , and cry out : ` Where be the hair that bind me so tightly , where be the eye that pierce through my heart , and where be the lip I kiss ?
Am I to be tie to a goat all my life ?
No , no !
nothing will induce me to become the laughing-stock of my subject for the sake of a goat-faced girl ! '
When they reach his own country he shut Renzolla up in a little turret chamber of his palace , with a waiting-maid , and give each of them ten bundle of flax to spin , tell them that their task must be finish by the end of the week .
The maid , obedient to the king 's command , set at once to work and comb out the flax , wound it round the spindle , and sit spin at her wheel so diligently that her work be quite do by Saturday evening .
But Renzolla , who have be spoil and pet in the fairy 's house , and be quite unaware of the change that have take place in her appearance , throw the flax out of the window and say : ` What be the king thinking of that he should give me this work to do ?
If he want shirt he can buy them .
It be n't even a if he have pick me out of the gutter , for he ought to remember that I bring him seven thousand golden guinea a my wedding portion , and that I be his wife and not his slave .
He must be mad to treat me like this . '
All the same , when Saturday evening come , and she saw that the waiting-maid have finish her task , she take fright l she should be punish for her idleness .
So she hurry off to the palace of the fairy , and confide all her woe to her .
The fairy embrace her tenderly , and give her a sack full of spun flax , in order that she might show it to the king , and let him see what a good worker she be .
Renzolla take the sack without one word of thanks , and return to the palace , leave the kind fairy very indignant over her want of gratitude .
When the king saw the flax all spun , he give Renzolla and the waiting-maid each a little dog , and tell them to look after the animal and train them carefully .
The waiting-maid brought hers up with the great possible care , and treat it almost a if it be her son .
But Renzolla say : ' I do n't know what to think .
Have I come among a lot of lunatic ?
Does the king imagine that I be go to comb and fee a dog with my own hand ? '
With these word she open the window and throw the poor little beast out , and he fell on the ground as dead a a stone .
When a few month have pass the king send a message to say he would like to see how the dog be get on .
Renzolla , who felt very uncomfortable in her mind at this request , hurry off once more to the fairy .
This time she find an old man at the door of the fairy 's palace , who say to her : ` Who be you , and what do you want ? '
When Renzolla hear his question she answer angrily : ` Do n't you know me , old Goat-beard ?
And how dare you address me in such a way ? '
` The pot ca n't call the kettle black , ' answer the old man , ` for it be not I , but you who have a goat 's head .
Just wait a moment , you ungrateful wretch , and I will show you to what a pas your want of gratitude have bring you . '
With these word he hurry away , and return with a mirror , which he hold up before Renzolla .
At the sight of her ugly , hairy face , the girl nearly faint with horror , and she break into loud sob at see her countenance so change .
-LSB- Illustration : RENZOLLA SEES HER FACE IN THE MIRROR -RSB- Then the old man say : ` You must remember , Renzolla , that you be a peasant 's daughter , and that the fairy turn you into a queen ; but you be ungrateful , and never as much a thanked her for all she have do for you .
Therefore she have determine to punish you .
But if you wish to lose your long white beard , throw yourself at the fairy 's foot and implore her to forgive you .
She have a tender heart , and will , perhaps , take pity on you . '
Renzolla , who be really sorry for her conduct , take the old man 's advice , and the fairy not only give her back her former face , but she dress her in a gold embroidered dress , present her with a beautiful carriage , and bring her back , accompany by a host of servant , to her husband .
When the king saw her look as beautiful a ever , he fell in love with her once more , and bitterly repent have cause her so much suffering .
So Renzolla live happily ever afterwards , for she love her husband , honour the fairy , and be grateful to the old man for have tell her the truth .

After a few mile they reach a house and garden belonging to the king , and close by be their favourite place for lunch .
The drive have make them very hungry , and they eat with a hearty appetite , till almost all the food have disappear .
When they have quite do , they say to their parent : ` Now we should like to wander about the garden a little , but when you want to go home , just call to u . '
And they run off , laugh , down a green glade , which lead to the garden .
But no sooner have they step across the fence , than a dark cloud come down and cover them , and prevent them see whither they be go .
-LSB- Illustration : NOW THE THREE PRINCESSES WERE LOST -RSB- Meanwhile the king and queen sat lazily among the heather , and an hour or two slip away .
The sun be drop towards the horizon , and they begin to think it be time to go home .
So they call to their daughter and call again , but no one answer them .
Frightened at the silence , they search every corner of the garden , the house , and the neighbouring wood , but no trace of the girl be to be find anywhere .
The earth seem to have swallow them up .
The poor parent be in despair .
The queen wept all the way home , and for many day after , and the king issue a proclamation that whoever should bring back his lost daughter should have one of them to wife , and should , after his death , reign in his stead .
Now two young general be at that time living at the court , and when they hear the king 's declaration , they say one to the other : ` Let u go in search of them ; perhaps we shall be the lucky person . '
And they set out , each mount on a strong horse , take with them a change of raiment and some money .
But though they inquire at every village they ride through , they could hear nothing of the princess , and by-and-by their money be all spent , and they be force to sell their horse , or give up the search .
Even this money only last a little while long , and nothing but their clothes lay between them and starvation .
They sell the spare garment that be bind on their saddle , and go in the coat they stand up in to the inn , to beg for some food , a they be really starve .
When , however , they have to pay for what they have eat and drink , they say to the host : ` We have no money , and naught but the clothes we stand up in .
Take these , and give u instead some old rag , and let u stay here and serve you . '
And the innkeeper be content with the bargain , and the general remain , and be his servant .
All this time the king and queen remain in their palace hunger for their child , but not a word be hear of either of them or of the general who have go to seek for them .
Now there be live in the palace a faithful servant of the king 's call Bensurdatu , who have serve him for many year , and when Bensurdatu saw how grieve the king be , he lift up his voice and say to him : ` Your majesty , let me go and seek your daughter . '
` No , no , Bensurdatu , ' reply the king .
` Three daughter have I lose , and two general , and shall I lose you also ? '
But Bensurdatu say again : ` Let me now go , your majesty ; trust me , and I will bring you back your daughter . '
Then the king give way , and Bensurdatu set forth , and rode on till he come to the inn , where he dismount and ask for food .
It be bring by the two general , whom he know at once in spite of their miserable clothes , and , much astonish , ask them how in the world they come there .
They tell him all their adventure , and he send for the innkeeper , and say to him : ` Give them back their garment , and I will pay everything that they owe you . '
And the innkeeper do a he be bid , and when the two general be dress in their proper clothes , they declare they would join Bensurdatu , and with him seek for the king 's daughter .
The three companion ride on for many mile , and at length they come to a wild place , without sign of a human be .
It be get dark , and fear to be lose on this desolate spot they push on their horse , and at last saw a light in the window of a tiny hut .
` Who come there ? '
ask a voice , a they knock at the door .
` Oh !
have pity on u , and give u a night 's shelter , ' reply Bensurdatu ; ` we be three tired traveller who have lose our way . '
Then the door be open by a very old woman , who stand back , and beckon them to enter .
` Whence do you come , and whither do you go ? '
say she .
` Ah , good woman , we have a heavy task before u , ' answer Bensurdatu , ` we be bind to carry the king 's daughter back to the palace ! '
` Oh , unhappy creature , ' cry she , ` you know not what you be do !
The king 's daughter be cover by a thick cloud , and no one know where they may now be . '
` Oh , tell u , if you know , my good woman , ' entreat Bensurdatu , ` for with them lie all our happiness . '
` Even if I be to tell you , ' answer she , ` you could not rescue them .
To do that you would have to go to the very bottom of a deep river , and though certainly you would find the king 's daughter there , yet the two eldest be guard by two giant , and the young be watch by a serpent with seven head . '
The two general , who stand by listen , be fill with terror at her word , and wish to return immediately ; but Bensurdatu stand firm , and say : ` Now we have get so far we must carry the thing through .
Tell u where the river be , so that we may get there as soon a possible . '
And the old woman tell them , and give them some cheese , wine , and bread , so that they should not set forth starving ; and when they have eat and drunk they lay themselves down to sleep .
The sun have only just rise above the hill next morning before they all wake , and , take leave of the wise woman who have help them , they ride on till they come to the river . '
I be the eldest , ' say one of the general , ` and it be my right to go down first . '
So the others fasten a cord round him , and give him a little bell , and let him down into the water .
But scarcely have the river close above his head when such dreadful rush sound and peal of thunder come crash round about him that he lose all his courage , and ring his bell , if perchance it might be hear amidst all this clamour .
Great be his relief when the rope begin slowly to pull him upwards .
Then the other general plunge in ; but he fare no good than the first , and be soon on dry ground again .
` Well , you be a brave pair ! '
say Bensurdatu , a he tie the rope round his own waist ; ` let u see what will happen to me . '
And when he hear the thunder and clamour round about him he think to himself , ` Oh , make a much noise a you like , it wo n't hurt me ! '
When his foot touch the bottom he find himself in a large , brilliantly light hall , and in the middle sit the eldest princess , and in front of her lay a huge giant , fast asleep .
Directly she saw Bensurdatu she nod to him , and ask with her eye how he have come there .
For answer he draw his sword , and be about to cut off the giant 's head , when she stop him quickly , and make sign to hide himself , a the giant be just begin to wake . '
I smell the flesh of a man ! '
murmur he , stretch his great arm .
` Why , how in the world could any man get down here ? '
replied she ; ` you have good go to sleep again . '
So he turn over and go to sleep .
Then the princess sign to Bensurdatu , who draw his sword and cut off the giant 's head with such a blow that it fly into the corner .
And the heart of the princess leapt within her , and she place a golden crown on the head of Bensurdatu , and call him her deliverer .
` Now show me where your sister be , ' he say , ` that I may free them also . '
So the princess open a door , and lead him into another hall , wherein sit her next sister , guard by a giant who be fast asleep .
When the second princess saw them , she make a sign to them to hide themselves , for the giant be show symptom of wake . '
I smell man 's flesh ! '
murmur he , sleepily .
` Now , how could any man get down here ? '
ask she ; ` go to sleep again . '
And as soon a he close his eye , Bensurdatu steal out from his corner , and strike such a blow at his head that it fly far , far away .
The princess could not find word to thank Bensurdatu for what he have do , and she too place in his hand a golden crown .
` Now show me where your young sister be , ' say he , ` that I may free her also . '
` Ah !
that I fear you will never be able to do , ' sigh they , ` for she be in the power of a serpent with seven head . '
` Take me to him , ' reply Bensurdatu .
` It will be a splendid fight . '
Then the princess open a door , and Bensurdatu pass through , and find himself in a hall that be even large than the other two .
And there stand the young sister , chain fast to the wall , and before her be stretch a serpent with seven head , horrible to see .
As Bensurdatu come forward it twist all it seven head in his direction , and then make a quick dart to snatch him within it grasp .
But Bensurdatu draw his sword and lay about him , till the seven head be roll on the floor .
Flinging down his sword he rush to the princess and break her chain , and she weep for joy , and embrace him , and take the golden crown from off her head , and place it in his hand .
-LSB- Illustration : BENSURDATU ATTACKS THE SEVEN-HEADED SERPENT . -RSB-
` Now we must go back to the upper world , ' say Bensurdatu , and lead her to the bottom of the river .
The other princess be wait there , and he tie the rope round the eldest , and ring his bell .
And the general above heard , and draw her gently up .
They then unfasten the cord and throw it back into the river , and in a few moment the second princess stand beside her sister .
So now there be leave only Bensurdatu and the young princess .
` Dear Bensurdatu , ' say she , ` do me a kindness , and let them draw you up before me .
I dread the treachery of the general . '
` No , no , ' reply Bensurdatu , ' I certainly will not leave you down here .
There be nothing to fear from my comrade . '
` If it be your wish I will go up then ; but first I swear that if you do not follow to marry me , I shall stay single for the rest of my life . '
Then he bind the rope round her , and the general draw her up .
But instead of lower the rope again into the river , envy at the courage and success of Bensurdatu so fill the heart of the two general , that they turn away and leave him to perish .
And , more than that , they threaten the princess , and force them to promise to tell their parent that it be the two general who have set them free .
` And if they should ask you about Bensurdatu , you must say you have never see him , ' they add ; and the princess , fear for their life , promise everything , and they ride back to court together .
The king and queen be beside themselves with joy when they saw their dear child once more .
But when the general have tell their story , and the danger they have run , the king declare that they have gain their reward , and that the two eldest princess should become their wife .
And now we must see what poor Bensurdatu be do .
He wait patiently a long , long time , but when the rope never come back he know he have be wrong , and that his comrade have betray him .
` Ah , now I shall never reach the world again , ' murmur he ; but be a brave man , and know that moan his fate would profit him nothing , he rise and begin to search through the three hall , where , perhaps , he might find something to help him .
In the last one stand a dish , cover with food , which remind him that he be hungry , and he sit down and ate and drank .
Months pass away , when , one morning , a he be walk through the hall , he notice a purse hang on the wall , which have never be there before .
He take it down to examine it , and nearly let it fall with surprise when a voice come from the purse say : ` What command have you ? '
` Oh , take me out of this horrible place , and up into the world again ; ' and in a moment he be , stand by the river bank , with the purse tightly grasp in his hand .
` Now let me have the most beautiful ship that ever be build , all man and ready for sea . '
And there be the ship , with a flag float from it mast on which be the word , ` King with the three crown . '
Then Bensurdatu climb on board , and sail away to the city where the three princess dwell ; and when he reach the harbour he blow trumpet and beat drum , so that every one ran to the door and window .
And the king heard too , and saw the beautiful vessel , and say to himself : ` That must indeed be a mighty monarch , for he have three crown while I have only one . '
So he hasten to greet the stranger , and invite him to his castle , for , think he , ` this will be a fine husband for my young daughter . '
Now , the young princess have never marry , and have turn a deaf ear to all her wooer .
Such a long time have pass since Bensurdatu have leave the palace , that the king never guess for a moment that the splendidly clad stranger before him be the man whom he have so deeply mourn a dead .
` Noble lord , ' say he , ` let u feast and make merry together , and then , if it seem good to you , do me the honour to take my young daughter to wife . '
And Bensurdatu be glad , and they all sit down to a great feast , and there be great rejoicing .
But only the young daughter be sad , for her thought be with Bensurdatu .
After they arise from the table the king say to her , ` Dear child , this mighty lord do you the honour to ask your hand in marriage . '
` Oh , father , ' answer she , ` spare me , I pray you , for I desire to remain single . '
Then Bensurdatu turn to her , and say : ` And if I be Bensurdatu , would you give the same answer to me ? '
And a she stand silently gaze at him , he add : ` Yes , I be Bensurdatu ; and this be my story . '
The king and queen have their heart stir within them at the tale of his adventure , and when he have end the king stretch out his hand , and say : ` Dear Bensurdatu , my young daughter shall indeed be your wife ; and when I die my crown shall be yours .
As for the men who have betray you , they shall leave the country and you shall see them no more . '
And the wedding feast be order , and rejoicing be hold for three day over the marriage of Bensurdatu and the young princess .

` He be quite close , ' answer the prince .
` Then throw the looking-glass on the ground , ' say the horse .
So the prince throw it ; and when the magician come up , the roan horse step on the mirror , and crash !

When the old man get up to it he urge the roan horse into the water , but a the water mount high and high , the magic flame which give the magician all his power grow small and small , till , with a fizz , it go out , and the old man and the roan horse sank in the river and disappear .
When the prince look round they be no long to be see .
` Now , ' say the horse , ` you may dismount ; there be nothing more to fear , for the magician be dead .
Beside that brook you will find a willow wand .
Gather it , and strike the earth with it , and it will open and you will see a door at your foot . '
When the prince have strike the earth with the wand a door appear , and open into a large vaulted stone hall .
` Lead me into that hall , ' say the horse , ' I will stay there ; but you must go through the field till you reach a garden , in the midst of which be a king 's palace .
When you get there you must ask to be take into the king 's service .
Good-bye , and do n't forget me . '
So they part ; but first the horse make the prince promise not to let anyone in the palace see his golden hair .
So he bind a scarf round it , like a turban , and the prince set out through the field , till he reach a beautiful garden , and beyond the garden he saw the wall and tower of a stately palace .
At the garden gate he meet the gardener , who ask him what he want . '
I want to take service with the king , ' reply the prince .
` Well , you may stay and work under me in the garden , ' say the man ; for a the prince be dress like a poor man , he could not tell that he be a king 's son . '
I need someone to weed the ground and to sweep the dead leaf from the path .
You shall have a florin a day , a horse to help you to cart the leaf away , and food and drink . '
So the prince consent , and set about his work .
But when his food be give to him he only eat half of it ; the rest he carry to the vault hall beside the brook , and give to the black horse .
And this he do every day , and the horse thank him for his faithful friendship .
One evening , a they be together , after his work in the garden be over , the horse say to him : ` To-morrow a large company of prince and great lord be come to your king 's palace .
They be come from far and near , a wooer for the three princess .
They will all stand in a row in the courtyard of the palace , and the three princess will come out , and each will carry a diamond apple in her hand , which she will throw into the air .
At whose-soever foot the apple fall he will be the bridegroom of that princess .
You must be close by in the garden at your work .
The apple of the young princess , who be much the most beautiful of the sister , will roll past the wooer and stop in front of you .
Pick it up at once and put it in your pocket . '
The next day , when the wooer be all assemble in the courtyard of the castle , everything happen just a the horse have say .
The princess throw the apple into the air , and the diamond apple of the young princess roll past all the wooer , out on to the garden , and stop at the foot of the young gardener , who be busy sweep the leaf away .
In a moment he have stoop down , pick up the apple and put it in his pocket .
As he stoop the scarf round his head slip a little to one side , and the princess catch sight of his golden hair , and love him from that moment .
-LSB- Illustration : The Gardener get the Apple -RSB- But the king be very sad , for his young daughter be the one he love best .
But there be no help for it ; and the next day a threefold wedding be celebrate at the palace , and after the wed the young princess return with her husband to the small hut in the garden where he live .
Some time after this the people of a neighbouring country go to war with the king , and he set out to battle , accompany by the husband of his two eldest daughter mount on stately steed .
But the husband of the young daughter have nothing but the old broken-down horse which help him in his garden work ; and the king , who be ashamed of this son-in-law , refuse to give him any other .
So a he be determine not to be leave behind , he go into the garden , mount the sorry nag , and set out .
But scarcely have he ride a few yard before the horse stumble and fell .
So he dismount and go down to the brook , to where the black horse live in the vaulted hall .
And the horse say to him : ` Saddle and bridle me , and then go into the next room and you will find a suit of armour and a sword .
Put them on , and we will ride forth together to battle . '
And the prince do a he be tell ; and when he have mount the horse his armour glitter in the sun , and he look so brave and handsome , that no one would have recognise him a the gardener who sweep away the dead leaf from the path .
The horse bore him away at a great pace , and when they reach the battle-field they saw that the king be lose the day , so many of his warrior have be slay .
But when the warrior on his black charger and in glitter armour appear on the scene , hew right and leave with his sword , the enemy be dismayed and flee in all direction , leave the king master of the field .
Then the king and his two son-in-law , when they saw their deliverer , shout , and all that be leave of the army join in the cry : ' A god have come to our rescue ! '
And they would have surround him , but his black horse rise in the air and bore him out of their sight .
Soon after this , part of the country rise in rebellion against the king , and once more he and his two son-in-law have to fare forth to battle .
And the son-in-law who be disguise a a gardener want to fight too .
So he come to the king and say : ` Dear father , let me ride with you to fight your enemy . ' '
I do n't want a blockhead like you to fight for me , ' answer the king .
` Besides , I have n't get a horse fit for you .
But see , there be a carter on the road cart hay , you may take his horse . '
So the prince take the carter 's horse , but the poor beast be old and tired , and after it have go a few yard it stumble and fell .
So the prince return sadly to the garden and watch the king ride forth at the head of the army accompany by his two son-in-law .
When they be out of sight the prince betook himself to the vaulted chamber by the brook-side , and have take counsel of the faithful black horse , he put on the glitter suit of armour , and be bear on the back of the horse through the air , to where the battle be be fight .
And once more he rout the king 's enemy , hack to right and leave with his sword .
And again they all cry : ' A god have come to our rescue ! '
But when they try to detain him the black horse rise in the air and bore him out of their sight .
When the king and his son-in-law return home they could talk of nothing but the hero who have fight for them , and all wonder who he could be .
Shortly afterwards the king of a neighbouring country declare war , and once more the king and his son-in-law and his subject have to prepare themselves for battle , and once more the prince beg to ride with them , but the king say he have no horse to spare for him .
` But , ' he add , ` you may take the horse of the woodman who bring the wood from the forest , it be good enough for you . '
So the prince take the woodman 's horse , but it be so old and useless that it could not carry him beyond the castle gate .
So he betook himself once more to the vault hall , where the black horse have prepare a still more magnificent suit of armour for him than the one he have wear on the previous occasion , and when he have put it on , and mount on the back of the horse , he bore him straight to the battle-field , and once more he scatter the king 's enemy , fight single-handed in their rank , and they flee in all direction .
But it happen that one of the enemy strike with his sword and wound the prince in the leg .
And the king take his own pocket-handkerchief , with his name and crown embroider on it , and bound it round the wounded leg .
And the king would fain have compel him to mount in a litter and be carry straight to the palace , and two of his knight be to lead the black charger to the royal stable .
But the prince put his hand on the mane of his faithful horse , and manage to pull himself up into the saddle , and the horse mount into the air with him .
Then they all shout and cry : ` The warrior who have fight for u be a god !
He must be a god . '
And throughout all the kingdom nothing else be speak about , and all the people say : ` Who can the hero be who have fight for u in so many battle ?
He can not be a man , he must be a god . '
And the king say : ` If only I could see him once more , and if it turn out that after all he be a man and not a god , I would reward him with half my kingdom . '
Now when the prince reach his home -- the gardener 's hut where he live with his wife -- he be weary , and he lay down on his bed and slept .
And his wife notice the handkerchief bound round his wounded leg , and she wonder what it could be .
Then she look at it more closely and saw in the corner that it be embroider with her father 's name and the royal crown .
So she run straight to the palace and tell her father .
And he and his two son-in-law follow her back to her house , and there the gardener lay asleep on his bed .
And the scarf that he always wear bound round his head have slip off , and his golden hair gleam on the pillow .
And they all recognise that this be the hero who have fight and win so many battle for them .
-LSB- Illustration : The Hero discover -RSB- Then there be great rejoice throughout the land , and the king reward his son-in-law with half of his kingdom , and he and his wife reign happily over it .

HERR LAZARUS AND THE DRAKEN Once upon a time there be a cobbler call Lazarus , who be very fond of honey .
One day , a he eat some while he sit at work , the fly collect in such number that with one blow he kill forty .
Then he go and order a sword to be make for him , on which he have write these word : ` With one blow I have slay forty . '
When the sword be ready he take it and go out into the world , and when he be two day ' journey from home he come to a spring , by which he lay himself down and sleep .
Now in that country there dwell Draken , one of whom come to the spring to draw water ; there he find Lazarus sleeping , and read what be write on his sword .
Then he go back to his people and tell them what he have see , and they all advise him to make fellowship with this powerful stranger .
So the Draken return to the spring , awake Lazarus , and say that if it be agreeable to him they should make fellowship together .
-LSB- Illustration : How THE DRAKEN FOUND HERR LAZARUS ASLEEP by the SPRING -RSB- Lazarus answer that he be willing , and after a priest have bless the fellowship , they return together to the other Draken , and Lazarus dwell among them .
After some day they tell him that it be their custom to take it in turn to bring wood and water , and a he be now of their company , he must take his turn .
They go first for water and wood , but at last it come to be Lazarus 's turn to go for water .
The Draken have a great leathern bag , hold two hundred measure of water .
This Lazarus could only , with great difficulty , drag empty to the spring , and because he could not carry it back full , he do not fill it at all , but , instead , he dig up the ground all round the spring .
As Lazarus remain so long away , the Draken send one of their number to see what have become of him , and when this one come to the spring , Lazarus say to him : ` We will no more plague ourselves by carry water every day .
I will bring the entire spring home at once , and so we shall be free from this burden . '
But the Draken call out : ` On no account , Herr Lazarus , else we shall all die of thirst ; rather will we carry the water ourselves in turn , and you alone shall be exempt . '
Next it come to be Lazarus 's turn to bring the wood .
Now the Draken , when they fetch the wood , always take an entire tree on their shoulder , and so carry it home .
Because Lazarus could not imitate them in this , he go to the forest , tie all the tree together with a thick rope , and remain in the forest till even .
Again the Draken send one of them after him to see what have become of him , and when this one ask what he be about , Lazarus answer : ' I will bring the entire forest home at once , so that after that we may have rest . '
But the Draken call out : ` By no mean , Herr Lazarus , else we shall all die of cold ; rather will we go ourselves to bring wood , and let you be free . '
And then the Draken tear up one tree , throw it over his shoulder , and so carry it home .
When they have live together some time , the Draken become weary of Lazarus , and agree among themselves to kill him ; each Draken , in the night while Lazarus sleep , should strike him a blow with a hatchet .
But Lazarus heard of this scheme , and when the evening come , he take a log of wood , cover it with his cloak , lay it in the place where he usually sleep , and then hide himself .
In the night the Draken come , and each one hit the log a blow with his hatchet , till it fly in piece .
Then they believe their object be gain , and they lay down again .
Thereupon Lazarus take the log , throw it away , and lay himself down in it stead .
Towards dawn , he begin to groan , and when the Draken heard that , they ask what ail him , to which he make answer : ` The gnat have sting me horribly . '
This terrify the Draken , for they believe that Lazarus take their blow for gnat-stings , and they determine at any price to get rid of him .
Next morning , therefore , they ask him if he have not wife or child , and say that if he would like to go and visit them they would give him a bag of gold to take away with him .
He agree willingly to this , but ask far that one of the Draken should go with him to carry the bag of gold .
They consent , and one be send with him .
When they have come to within a short distance of Lazarus 's house , he say to the Draken : ` Stop here , in the meantime , for I must go on in front and tie up my child , l they eat you . '
So he go and tie his child with strong rope , and say to them : ` As soon a the Draken come in sight , call out as loud a you can , `` Drakenflesh !
Drakenflesh ! '' '
So , when the Draken appear , the child cry out ; ` Drakenflesh !
Drakenflesh ! '
and this so terrified the Draken that he let the bag fall and flee .
On the road he meet a fox , which ask him why he seem so frightened .
He answer that he be afraid of the child of Herr Lazarus , who have be within a hair-breadth of eat him up .
But the fox laugh , and say : ` What !
you be afraid of the child of Herr Lazarus ?
He have two fowl , one of which I eat yesterday , the other I will go and fetch now -- If you do not believe me , come and see for yourself ; but you must first tie yourself on to my tail . '
The Draken then tie himself on to the fox 's tail , and go back thus with it to Lazarus 's house , in order to see what it would arrange .
There stand Lazarus with his gun raise ready to fire , who , when he saw the fox come along with the Draken , call out to the fox : ` Did I not tell you to bring me all the Draken , and you bring me only one ? '
When the Draken heard that he make off to the right-about at once , and run so fast that the fox be dash in piece against the stone .
When Lazarus have get quit of the Draken he build himself , with their gold , a magnificent house , in which he spend the rest of his day in great enjoyment .

She sink right through the earth and find herself in a desert place with nothing but rock and tree and no sign of any human be .
The only living creature she saw be a very pretty little dog , who run up to her and at once begin to caress her .
She take him in her arm , and after play with him for a little put him down again , when he start off in front of her , look round from time to time a though beg her to follow .
She let him lead her on , and presently reach a little hill , from which she saw a valley full of lovely fruit tree , bear flower and fruit together .

The young do not care so much about sport , and he often stay with his mother .
One morning , however , a the whole seven be go out for a long expedition , they say to their aunt , ` Dear aunt , if a baby sister come into the world to-day , wave a white handkerchief , and we will return immediately ; but if it be only a boy , just brandish a sickle , and we will go on with what we be do . '
Now the baby when it arrive really prove to be a girl , but a the aunt could not bear the boy , she think it be a good opportunity to get rid of them .
So she wave the sickle .
And when the seven brother saw the sign they say , ` Now we have nothing to go back for , ' and plunge deep into the desert .
The little girl soon grow to be a big girl , and she be call by all her friend -LRB- though she do not know it -RRB- ` Udea , who have drive her seven brother into strange land . '
One day , when she have be quarrel with her playmate , the old among them say to her , ` It be a pity you be bear , a ever since , your brother have be oblige to roam about the world . '
Udea do not answer , but go home to her mother and ask her , ` Have I really get brother ? '
` Yes , ' reply her mother , ` seven of them .
But they go away the day you be bear , and I have never hear of them since . '
Then the girl say , ' I will go and look for them till I find them . '
` My dear child , ' answer her mother , ` it be fifteen year since they leave , and no man have see them .
How will you know which way to go ? '
` Oh , I will follow them , north and south , east and west , and though I may travel far , yet some day I will find them . '
Then her mother say no more , but give her a camel and some food , and a negro and his wife to take care of her , and she fasten a cowrie shell round the camel 's neck for a charm , and bid her daughter go in peace .
During the first day the party journeyed on without any adventure , but the second morning the negro say to the girl , ` Get down , and let the negress ride instead of you . '
` Mother , ' cry Udea .
` What be it ? '
ask her mother .
` Barka want me to dismount from my camel . '
` Leave her alone , Barka , ' command the mother , and Barka do not dare to persist .
But on the following day he say again to Udea , ` Get down , and let the negress ride instead of you , ' and though Udea call to her mother she be too far away , and the mother never hear her .
Then the negro seize her roughly and throw her on the ground , and say to his wife , ` Climb up , ' and the negress climb up , while the girl walk by the side .
She have mean to ride all the way on her camel a her foot be bare and the stone cut them till the blood come .
But she have to walk on till night , when they halt , and the next morning it be the same thing again .
Weary and bleed the poor girl begin to cry , and implore the negro to let her ride , if only for a little .
But he take no notice , except to bid her walk a little faster .
-LSB- Illustration : THE NEGRO COMPELS UDEA TO WALK -RSB- By-and-by they pass a caravan , and the negro stop and ask the leader if they have come across seven young men , who be think to be hunt somewhere about .
And the man answer , ` Go straight on , and by mid-day you will reach the castle where they live . '
When he hear this , the black melt some pitch in the sun , and smear the girl with it , till she look as much a negro a he do .
Next he bid his wife get down from the camel , and tell Udea to mount , which she be thankful to do .
So they arrive at her brother ' castle .
Leaving the camel kneeling at the entrance for Udea to dismount , the negro knock loudly at the door , which be open by the young brother , all the others be away hunt .
He do not of course recognise Udea , but he know the negro and his wife , and welcome them gladly , add , ` But who do the other negress belong to ? '
` Oh , that be your sister ! '
say they .
` My sister !
but she be coal black ! '
` That may be , but she be your sister for all that . '
The young man ask no more question , but take them into the castle , and he himself wait outside till his brother come home .
As soon a they be alone , the negro whisper to Udea , ` If you dare to tell your brother that I make you walk , or that I smear you with pitch , I will kill you . '
` Oh , I will be sure to say nothing , ' reply the girl , trembling , and at that moment the six elder brother appear in sight . '
I have some good news for you , ' say the young , hasten to meet them ; ` our sister be here ! '
` Nonsense , ' they answer .
` We have no sister ; you know the child that be bear be a boy . '
` But that be not true , ' reply he , ` and here she be with the negro and his wife .
Only -- she too be black , ' he add softly , but his brother do not hear him , and push past joyfully .
` How be you , good old Barka ? '
they say to the negro ; ` and how come it that we never know that we have a sister till now ? '
and they greet Udea warmly , while she shed tear of relief and gladness .
The next morning they all agree that they would not go out hunting .
And the eldest brother take Udea on his knee , and she comb his hair and talk to him of their home till the tear run down his cheek and drop on her bare arm .
And where the tear fell a white mark be make .
Then the brother take a cloth and rub the place , and he saw that she be not black at all .
` Tell me , who paint you over like this ? '
cry he . '
I be afraid to tell you , ' sob the girl , ` the negro will kill me . '
` Afraid !
and with seven brother ! '
` Well , I will tell you then , ' she answer .
` The negro force me to dismount from the camel and let his wife ride instead .
And the stone cut my foot till they bleed and I have to bind them .
And after that , when we hear your castle be near by , he take pitch and smear my body with it . '
Then the brother rush in wrath from the room , and seize his sword , cut off first the negro 's head and then his wife 's .
He next brought in some warm water , and wash his sister all over , till her skin be white and shin again .
` Ah , now we see that you be our sister ! '
they all say .
` What fool the negro must have think u , to believe for an instant that we could have a sister who be black ! '
And all that day and the next they remain in the castle .
But on the third morning they say to their sister : ` Dear sister , you must lock yourself into this castle , with only the cat for company .
And be very careful never to eat anything which she do not eat too .
You must be sure to give her a bit of everything .
In seven day we shall be back again . '
` All right , ' she answer , and lock herself into the castle with the cat .
On the eighth day the brother come home .
` How be you ? '
they ask .
` You have not be anxious ? '
` No , why should I be anxious ?
The gate be fast lock , and in the castle be seven door , and the seventh be of iron .
What be there to frighten me ? '
` No one will try to hurt u , ' say the brother , ` for they fear u greatly .
But for yourself , we implore you to do nothing without consult the cat , who have grow up in the house , and take care never to neglect her advice . '
` All right , ' reply Udea , ` and whatever I eat she shall have half . '
` Capital !
and if ever you be in danger the cat will come and tell u -- only elf and pigeon , which fly round your window , know where to find u . '
` This be the first I have hear of the pigeon , ' say Udea .
` Why do you not speak of them before ? '
` We always leave them food and water for seven day , ' reply the brother .
` Ah , ' sigh the girl , ` if I have only know , I would have give them fresh food and fresh water ; for after seven day anything become bad .
Would it not be good if I feed them every day ? '
` Much good , ' say they , ` and we shall feel any kindness you do towards the cat or the pigeon exactly a if they be show to ourselves . '
` Set your mind at ease , ' answer the girl , ' I will treat them a if they be my brother . '
That night the brother sleep in the castle , but after breakfast next morning they buckle on their weapon and mount their horse , and ride off to their hunting ground , call out to their sister , ` Mind you let nobody in till we come back . '
` Very well , ' cry she , and keep the door carefully lock for seven day and on the eighth the brother return a before .
Then , after spend one even with her , they depart as soon a they have do breakfast .
Directly they be out of sight Udea begin to clean the house , and among the dust she find a bean which she eat .
` What be you eat ? '
ask the cat .
` Nothing , ' say she .
` Open your mouth , and let me see , ' The girl do a she be tell , and then the cat say ` Why do you not give me half ? ' '
I forget , ' answer she , ` but there be plenty of bean about , you can have as many a you like . '
` No , that wo n't do .
I want half of that particular bean . '
` But how can I give it you ?
I tell you I have eat it .
I can roast you a hundred others . '
` No , I want half of that one . '
` Oh !
do a you like , only go away ! '
cry she .
So the cat run straight to the kitchen fire , and spit on it and put it out , and when Udea come to cook the supper she have nothing to light it with .
` Why do you put the fire out ? '
ask she .
` Just to show you how nicely you would be able to cook the supper .
Did n't you tell me to do what I like ? '
The girl leave the kitchen and climb up on the roof of the castle and look out .
Far , far away , so far that she could hardly see it , be the glow of a fire . '
I will go and fetch a burn coal from there and light my fire , ' think she , and open the door of the castle .
When she reach the place where the fire be kindle , a hideous man-eater be crouch over it .
` Peace be with you , grandfather , ' say she .
` The same to you , ' reply the man-eater .
` What bring you here , Udea ? ' '
I come to ask for a lump of burn coal , to light my fire with . '
-LSB- Illustration : THE MANEATER -RSB- ` Do you want a big lump or a little lump ? '
` Why , what difference do it make ? '
say she .
` If you have a big lump you must give me a strip of your skin from your ear to your thumb , and if you have a little lump , you must give me a strip from your ear to your little finger . '
Udea , who think that one sound as bad a the other , say she would take the big lump , and when the man-eater have cut the skin , she go home again .
And a she hasten on a raven beheld the blood on the ground , and plaster it with earth , and stay by her till she reach the castle .
And a she enter the door he fly past , and she shriek from fright , for up to that moment she have not see him .
In her terror she call after him , ` May you get the same start a you have give me ! '
` Why should you wish me harm , ' ask the raven , pause in his flight , ` when I have do you a service ? '
` What service have you do me ? '
say she .
` Oh , you shall soon see , ' reply the raven , and with his bill he scrap away all the earth he have smear over the blood and then fly away .
In the night the man-eater get up , and follow the blood till he come to Udea 's castle .
He enter through the gate which she have leave open , and go on till he reach the inside of the house .
But here he be stop by the seven door , six of wood and one of iron , and all fast lock .
And he call through them ` Oh Udea , what do you see your grandfather do ? ' '
I saw him spread silk under him , and silk over him , and lay himself down in a four-post bed . '
When he hear that , the man-eater broke in one door , and laugh and go away .
And the second night he come back , and ask her again what she have see her grandfather do , and she answer him a before , and he break in another door , and laugh and go away , and so each night till he reach the seventh door .
Then the maiden write a letter to her brother , and bound it round the neck of a pigeon , and say to it , ` Oh , thou pigeon that servedst my father and my grandfather , carry this letter to my brother , and come back at once . '
And the pigeon fly away .
It fly and it fly and it fly till it find the brother .
The eldest unfasten the letter from the pigeon 's neck , and read what his sister have write : ' I be in a great strait , my brother .
If you do not rescue me to-night , to-morrow I shall be no longer living , for the man-eater have break open six door , and only the iron door be leave .
So haste , haste , post haste . '
` Quick , quick !
my brother , ' cry he .
` What be the matter ? '
ask they .
` If we can not reach our sister to-night , to-morrow she will be the prey of the man-eater . '
And without more word they spring on their horse , and rode like the wind .
The gate of the castle be throw down , and they enter the court and call loudly to their sister .
But the poor girl be so ill with fear and anxiety that she could not even speak .
Then the brother dismount and pass through the six open door , till they stand before the iron one , which be still shut .
` Udea , open ! '
they cry , ` it be only your brother ! '
And she arise and unlock the door , and throw herself on the neck of the eldest burst into tear .
` Tell u what have happen , ' he say , ` and how the man-eater trace you here . '
` It be all the cat 's fault , ' reply Udea .
` She put out my fire so that I could not cook .
All about a bean !
I eat one and forget to give her any of it . '
` But we tell you so particularly , ' say the eldest brother , ` never to eat anything without share it with the cat . '
` Yes , but I tell you I forget , ' answer Udea .
` Does the man-eater come here every night ? '
ask the brother .
` Every night , ' say Udea , ` and he break one door in and then go away . '
Then all the brother cry together , ` We will dig a great hole , and fill it with burn wood , and spread a covering over the top ; and when the man-eater arrive we will push him into it . '
So they all set to work , and prepare the great hole , and set fire to the wood , till it be reduce to a mass of glow charcoal .
And when the man-eater come , and call as usual , ` Udea , what do you see your grandfather do ? '
she answer , ' I saw him pull off the as 's skin and devour the as , and he fell in the fire , and the fire burn him up . '
Then the man-eater be fill with rage , and he fling himself upon the iron door and burst it in .
On the other side stand Udea 's seven brother , who say , ` Come , rest yourself a little on this mat . '
And the man-eater sit down , and he fell right into the burning pit which be under the mat , and they heap on more wood , till nothing be leave of him , not even a bone .
Only one of his finger-nails be blow away , and fell into an upper chamber where Udea be stand , and stick under one of the nail of her own finger .
And she sink lifeless to the earth .
-LSB- Illustration : UDEA FOUND LIFELESS BY HER SEVEN BROTHERS -RSB- Meanwhile her brother sit below wait for her and wonder why she do not come .

Then he saw that she be dead , and rush down to his brother in the courtyard and call out , ` Come quickly , our sister be dead ! '

` Tell me , ' say the eldest , as soon a he could speak , ` how it all come about , and what kill you . ' '
I be wait in the upper chamber , ' say she , ` and a nail of the man-eater 's stuck under my nail , and I fell dead upon the ground .

She be silent and the eldest brother spoke .
` Will you listen to what I have to say , my brother ? '
And they reply , ` How should we not hear you ?

Now it happen that one day their father have to set out for a tour in a distant part of his kingdom .
Before he leave , his young daughter make him promise to bring her back a wreath of wild flower .
When the king be ready to return to his palace , he bethink himself that he would like to take home present to each of his three daughter ; so he go into a jeweller 's shop , and buy a beautiful necklace for the eldest princess ; then he go to a rich merchant 's and buy a dress embroider in gold and silver thread for the second princess , but in none of the flower shop nor in the market could he find the wreath of wild flower that his young daughter have set her heart on .
So he have to set out on his homeward way without it .
Now his journey lead him through a thick forest .
While he be still about four mile distant from his palace , he notice a white wolf squat on the roadside , and , behold !

Then the king call to the coachman , and order him to get down from his seat and fetch him the wreath from the wolf 's head .
But the wolf hear the order and say : ` My lord and king , I will let you have the wreath , but I must have something in return . '
` What do you want ? '

I will gladly give you rich treasure in exchange for it . ' '
I do not want rich treasure , ' reply the wolf .
` Only promise to give me the first thing that meet you on your way to your castle .
In three day I shall come and fetch it . '
And the king thought to himself : ' I be still a good long way from home , I be sure to meet a wild animal or a bird on the road , it will be quite safe to promise . '
So he consent , and carry the wreath away with him .
But all along the road he meet no living creature till he turn into the palace gate , where his young daughter be wait to welcome him home .

And the young princess ask them why they both look so sad , and why they weep .
Then her father tell her what a price he would have to pay for the wreath of wild flower he have bring home to her , for in three day a white wolf would come and claim her and carry her away , and they would never see her again .
But the queen thought and thought , and at last she hit upon a plan .
There be in the palace a servant maid the same age and the same height a the princess , and the queen dress her up in a beautiful dress belonging to her daughter , and determine to give her to the white wolf , who would never know the difference .
On the third day the wolf strode into the palace yard and up the great stair , to the room where the king and queen be seat . '
I have come to claim your promise , ' he say .
` Give me your young daughter . '
Then they lead the servant maid up to him , and he say to her : ` You must mount on my back , and I will take you to my castle . '
And with these word he swing her on to his back and leave the palace .
When they reach the place where he have meet the king and give him the wreath of wild flower , he stop , and tell her to dismount that they might rest a little .
So they sit down by the roadside . '
I wonder , ' say the wolf , ` what your father would do if this forest belong to him ? '
And the girl answer : ` My father be a poor man , so he would cut down the tree , and saw them into plank , and he would sell the plank , and we should never be poor again ; but would always have enough to eat . '
Then the wolf know that he have not get the real princess , and he swing the servant-maid on to his back and carry her to the castle .
And he stride angrily into the king 's chamber , and speak .
` Give me the real princess at once .
If you deceive me again I will cause such a storm to burst over your palace that the wall will fall in , and you will all be bury in the ruin . '
Then the king and the queen wept , but they saw there be no escape .
So they send for their young daughter , and the king say to her : ` Dearest child , you must go with the white wolf , for I promise you to him , and I must keep my word . '
So the princess get ready to leave her home ; but first she go to her room to fetch her wreath of wild flower , which she take with her .
Then the white wolf swing her on his back and bore her away .
But when they come to the place where he have rest with the servant-maid , he tell her to dismount that they might rest for a little at the roadside .

And here be a spinning-wheel , with which you will be able to spin moss into silk .
When you leave me you will reach a glass mountain .
Put on the shoe that I have give you and with them you will be able to climb it quite easily .
At the summit you will find the palace of the white wolf . '
Then the princess set out , and before long she reach the glass mountain , and at the summit she find the white wolf 's palace , a the sun have say .
But no one recognise her , a she have disguise herself a an old woman , and have wind a shawl round her head .
Great preparation be go on in the palace for the wedding , which be to take place next day .
Then the princess , still disguise a an old woman , take out her spinning-wheel , and begin to spin moss into silk .
And a she spin the new bride pass by , and see the moss turn into silk , she say to the old woman : ` Little mother , I wish you would give me that spinning-wheel . '
-LSB- Illustration : The Bride wish to buy the Spinning-Wheel -RSB- And the princess answer , ' I will give it to you if you will allow me to sleep to-night on the mat outside the prince 's door . '
And the bride reply , ` Yes , you may sleep on the mat outside the door . '
So the princess give her the spinning-wheel .
And that night , wind the shawl all round her , so that no one could recognise her , she lay down on the mat outside the white wolf 's door .
And when everyone in the palace be asleep she begin to tell the whole of her story .
She tell how she have be one of three sister , and that she have be the young and the fair of the three , and that her father have betroth her to a white wolf .
And she tell how she have go first to the wedding of one sister , and then with her husband to the wedding of the other sister , and how her mother have order the servant to throw the white fur skin into the kitchen fire .
And then she tell of her wandering through the forest ; and of how she have seek the white wolf weeping ; and how the wind and star and moon and sun have befriend her , and have help her to reach his palace .
And when the white wolf heard all the story , he know that it be his first wife , who have seek him , and have find him , after such great danger and difficulty .
But he say nothing , for he wait till the next day , when many guest -- king and prince from far country -- be come to his wedding .
Then , when all the guest be assemble in the banqueting hall , he speak to them and say : ` Hearken to me , ye king and prince , for I have something to tell you .
I have lose the key of my treasure casket , so I order a new one to be make ; but I have since find the old one .
Now , which of these key be the good ? '
Then all the king and royal guest answer : ` Certainly the old key be well than the new one . '
` Then , ' say the wolf , ` if that be so , my former bride be good than my new one . '
And he send for the new bride , and he give her in marriage to one of the prince who be present , and then he turn to his guest , and say : ` And here be my former bride ' -- and the beautiful princess be lead into the room and seat beside him on his throne . '
I think she have forget me , and that she would never return .
But she have seek me everywhere , and now we be together once more we shall never part again . '
MOHAMMED WITH THE MAGIC FINGER Once upon a time , there live a woman who have a son and a daughter .
One morning she say to them : ' I have hear of a town where there be no such thing a death : let u go and dwell there . '
So she break up her house , and go away with her son and daughter .
When she reach the city , the first thing she do be to look about and see if there be any churchyard , and when she find none , she exclaim , ` This be a delightful spot .
We will stay here for ever . '
By-and-by , her son grow to be a man , and he take for a wife a girl who have be bear in the town .
But after a little while he grow restless , and go away on his travel , leave his mother , his wife , and his sister behind him .
He have not be go many week when one even his mother say , ' I be not well , my head ache dreadfully . '
` What do you say ? '
inquire her daughter-in-law .
` My head feel ready to split , ' reply the old woman .
The daughter-in-law ask no more question , but leave the house , and go in haste to some butcher in the next street . '
I have get a woman to sell ; what will you give me for her ? '
say she .
The butcher answer that they must see the woman first , and they all return together .
Then the butcher take the woman and tell her they must kill her .
` But why ? '
she ask .
` Because , ' they say , ` it be always our custom that when person be ill and complain of their head they should be kill at once .
It be a much good way than leave them to die a natural death . '
` Very well , ' reply the woman .
` But leave , I pray you , my lung and my liver untouched , till my son come back .
Then give both to him . '
But the men take them out at once , and give them to the daughter-in-law , say : ` Put away these thing till your husband return . '
And the daughter-in-law take them , and hide them in a secret place .
When the old woman 's daughter , who have be in the wood , heard that her mother have be kill while she be out , she be fill with fright , and run away as fast a she could .
At last she reach a lonely spot far from the town , where she think she be safe , and sit down on a stone , and weep bitterly .
As she be sit , sob , a man pass by .
` What be the matter , little girl ?
Answer me !
I will be your friend . '
` Ah , sir , they have kill my mother ; my brother be far away , and I have nobody . '
` Will you come with me ? '
ask the man .
` Thankfully , ' say she , and he lead her down , down , under the earth , till they reach a great city .
Then he marry her , and in course of time she have a son .
And the baby be know throughout the city a ` Mohammed with the magic finger , ' because , whenever he stick out his little finger , he be able to see anything that be happen for as far a two day ' distance .
By-and-by , a the boy be grow big , his uncle return from his long journey , and go straight to his wife .
` Where be my mother and sister ? '
he ask ; but his wife answer ; ` Have something to eat first , and then I will tell you . '
But he reply : ` How can I eat till I know what have become of them ? '
Then she fetch , from the upper chamber , a box full of money , which she lay before him , say , ` That be the price of your mother .
She sell well . '
` What do you mean ? '
he gasp .
` Oh , your mother complain one day that her head be ache , so I get in two butcher and they agree to take her .
However , I have get her lung and liver hidden , till you come back , in a safe place . '
` And my sister ? '
` Well , while the people be chop up your mother she run away , and I hear no more of her . '
` Give me my mother 's liver and lung , ' say the young man .
And she give them to him .
Then he put them in his pocket , and go away , say : ' I can stay no longer in this horrible town .
I go to seek my sister . '
Now , one day , the little boy stretch out his finger and say to his mother , ` My uncle be come ! '
-LSB- Illustration : MY UNCLE IS COMING -RSB- ` Where be he ? '
she ask .
` He be still two day ' journey off : look for u ; but he will soon be here . '
And in two day , a the boy have foretell , the uncle have find the hole in the earth , and arrive at the gate of the city .
All his money be spend , and not know where his sister live , he begin to beg of all the people he saw .
` Here come my uncle , ' call out the little boy .
` Where ? '
ask his mother .
` Here at the house door ; ' and the woman run out and embrace him , and weep over him .
When they could both speak , he say : ` My sister , be you by when they kill my mother ? ' '
I be absent when they slew her , ' reply she , ` and a I could do nothing , I run away .
But you , my brother , how do you get here ? '
` By chance , ' he say , ` after I have wander far ; but I do not know I should find you ! '
` My little boy tell me you be come , ' she explain , ` when you be yet two day distant ; he alone of all men have that great gift . '
But she do not tell him that her husband could change himself into a serpent , a dog , or a monster , whenever he please .
He be a very rich man , and possess large herd of camel , goat , sheep , cattle , horse and ass ; all the best of their kind .
And the next morning , the sister say : ` Dear brother , go and watch our sheep , and when you be thirsty , drink their milk ! '
` Very well , ' answer he , and he go .
Soon after , she say again , ` Dear brother , go and watch our goat . '
` But why ?
I like tend sheep better ! '
` Oh , it be much nicer to be a goatherd , ' she say ; so he take the goat out .
When he be go , she say to her husband , ` You must kill my brother , for I can not have him live here with me . '
` But , my dear , why should I ?
He have do me no harm . ' '
I wish you to kill him , ' she answer , ` or if not I will leave . '
` Oh , all right , then , ' say he ; ` to-morrow I will change myself into a serpent , and hide myself in the date barrel ; and when he come to fetch date I will sting him in the hand . '
` That will do very well , ' say she .
When the sun be up next day , she call to her brother , ` Go and mind the goat . '
` Yes , of course , ' he reply ; but the little boy call out : ` Uncle , I want to come with you . '
` Delighted , ' say the uncle , and they start together .
After they have get out of sight of the house the boy say to him , ` Dear uncle , my father be go to kill you .
He have change himself into a serpent , and have hide himself in the date barrel .
My mother have tell him to do it . '
` And what be I to do ? '
ask the uncle . '
I will tell you .
When we bring the goat back to the house , and my mother say to you , `` I be sure you must be hungry : get a few date out of the cask , '' just say to me , `` I be not feeling very well , Mohammed , you go and get them for me . '' '
So when they reach the house the sister come out to meet them , say , ` Dear brother , you must certainly be hungry : go and get a few date . '
But he answer , ' I be not feeling very well .
Mohammed , you go and get them for me . '
` Of course I will , ' reply the little boy , and run at once to the cask .
` No , no , ' his mother call after him ; ` come here directly !
Let your uncle fetch them himself ! '
But the boy would not listen , and cry out to her , ' I would rather get them , ' thrust his hand into the date cask .
Instead of the fruit , it strike against something cold and slimy , and he whisper softly , ` Keep still ; it be I , your son ! '
Then he pick up his date and go away to his uncle .
` Here they be , dear uncle ; eat as many a you want . '
And his uncle eat them .
When he saw that the uncle do not mean to come near the cask , the serpent crawl out and regain his proper shape . '
I be thankful I do not kill him , ' he say to his wife ; ` for , after all , he be my brother-in-law , and it would have be a great sin ! '
` Either you kill him or I leave you , ' say she .
` Well , well ! '
sigh the man , ` to-morrow I will do it . '
The woman let that night go by without do anything further , but at daybreak she say to her brother , ` Get up , brother ; it be time to take the goat to pasture ! '
` All right , ' cry he . '
I will come with you , uncle , ' call out the little boy .
` Yes , come along , ' reply he .
But the mother run up , say , ` The child must not go out in this cold or he will be ill ; ' to which he only answer , ` Nonsense !
I be go , so it be no use your talk !
I be go !
I be !
I be ! '
` Then go ! '
she say .
And so they start , drive the goat in front of them .
When they reach the pasture the boy say to his uncle : ` Dear uncle , this night my father mean to kill you .
While we be away he will creep into your room and hide in the straw .
Directly we get home my mother will say to you , `` Take that straw and give it to the sheep , '' and , if you do , he will bite you . '
` Then what be I to do ? '
ask the man .
` Oh , do not be afraid , dear uncle !
I will kill my father myself . '
` All right , ' reply the uncle .
As they drive back the goat towards the house , the sister cry : ` Be quick , dear brother , go and get me some straw for the sheep . '
` Let me go , ' say the boy .
` You be not big enough ; your uncle will get it , ' reply she .
` We will both get it , ' answer the boy ; ` come , uncle , let u go and fetch that straw ! '
` All right , ' reply the uncle , and they go to the door of the room .
` It seem very dark , ' say the boy ; ' I must go and get a light ; ' and when he come back with one , he set fire to the straw , and the serpent be burn .
Then the mother break into sob and tear .
` Oh , you wretched boy !
What have you do ?
Your father be in that straw , and you have kill him ! '
` Now , how be I to know that my father be lie in that straw , instead of in the kitchen ? '
say the boy .
But his mother only weep the more , and sob out , ` From this day you have no father .
You must do without him a best you can ! '
` Why do you marry a serpent ? '
ask the boy . '
I think he be a man !
How do he learn those odd trick ? '
As the sun rise , she wake her brother , and say , ` Go and take the goat to pasture ! ' '
I will come too , ' say the little boy .
` Go then ! '
say his mother , and they go together .
On the way the boy begin : ` Dear uncle , this night my mother mean to kill both of u , by poison u with the bone of the serpent , which she will grind to powder and sprinkle in our food . '
` And what be we to do ? '
ask the uncle . '
I will kill her , dear uncle .
I do not want either a father or a mother like that ! '
When they come home in the evening they saw the woman prepare supper , and secretly scatter the powdered bone of the serpent on one side of the dish .
On the other , where she mean to eat herself , there be no poison .
And the boy whisper to his uncle , ` Dear uncle , be sure you eat from the same side of the dish a I do ! '
` All right , ' say the uncle .
So they all three sit down to the table , but before they help themselves the boy say , ' I be thirsty , mother ; will you get me some milk ? '
` Very well , ' say she , ` but you have good begin your supper . '
And when she come back with the milk they be both eat busily .
` Sit down and have something too , ' say the boy , and she sit down and help herself from the dish , but at the very first moment she sink dead upon the ground .
` She have get what she mean for u , ' observe the boy ; ` and now we will sell all the sheep and cattle . '
So the sheep and cattle be sell , and the uncle and nephew take the money and go to see the world .
For ten day they travel through the desert , and then they come to a place where the road part in two .
` Uncle ! '
say the boy .
` Well , what be it ? '
reply he .
` You see these two road ?
You must take one , and I the other ; for the time have come when we must part . '
But the uncle cry , ` No , no , my boy , we will keep together always . '
` Alas !
that can not be , ' say the boy ; ` so tell me which way you will go . ' '
I will go to the west , ' say the uncle .
` One word before I leave you , ' continue the boy .
` Beware of any man who have red hair and blue eye .
Take no service under him . '
` All right , ' reply the uncle , and they part .
For three day the man wander on without any food , till he be very hungry .
Then , when he be almost fainting , a stranger meet him and say , ` Will you work for me ? '
` By contract ? '
ask the man .
` Yes , by contract , ' reply the stranger , ` and whichever of u break it , shall have a strip of skin take from his body . '
` All right , ' reply the man ; ` what shall I have to do ? '
` Every day you must take the sheep out to pasture , and carry my old mother on your shoulder , take great care her foot shall never touch the ground .
And , besides that , you must catch , every evening , seven singing bird for my seven son . '
` That be easily do , ' say the man .
Then they go back together , and the stranger say , ` Here be your sheep : and now stoop down , and let my mother climb on your back . '
` Very good , ' answer Mohammed 's uncle .
The new shepherd do a he be tell , and return in the evening with the old woman on his back , and the seven singing bird in his pocket , which he give to the seven boy , when they come to meet him .
So the day pass , each one exactly like the other .
At last , one night , he begin to weep , and cry : ` Oh , what have I do , that I should have to perform such hateful task ? '
And his nephew Mohammed saw him from afar , and think to himself , ` My uncle be in trouble -- I must go and help him ; ' and the next morning he go to his master and say : ` Dear master , I must go to my uncle , and I wish to send him here instead of myself , while I serve under his master .
And that you may know it be he and no other man , I will give him my staff , and put my mantle on him . '
` All right , ' say the master .
Mohammed set out on his journey , and in two day he arrive at the place where his uncle be stand with the old woman on his back , try to catch the bird a they fly past .
And Mohammed touch him on the arm , and speak : ` Dear uncle , do I not warn you never to take service under any blue-eyed red-haired man ? '
-LSB- Illustration : · HOW · MOHAMMED · FINDS · HIS · UNCLE · -RSB- ` But what could I do ? '
ask the uncle . '
I be hungry , and he pass , and we sign a contract . '
` Give the contract to me ! '
say the young man .
` Here it be , ' reply the uncle , hold it out .
` Now , ' continue Mohammed , ` let the old woman get down from your back . '
` Oh no , I must n't do that ! '
cry he .
But the nephew pay no attention , and go on talk : ` Do not worry yourself about the future .
I see my way out of it all .
And , first , you must take my stick and my mantle and leave this place .
After two day ' journey , straight before you , you will come to some tent which be inhabit by shepherd .
Go in there , and wait . '
` All right ! '
answer the uncle .
Then Mohammed with the Magic Finger pick up a stick and strike the old woman with it , say , ` Get down , and look after the sheep ; I want to go to sleep . '
` Oh , certainly ! '
reply she .
So Mohammed lay down comfortably under a tree and slept till even .
Towards sunset he wake up and say to the old woman : ` Where be the singing bird which you have get to catch ? '
` You never tell me anything about that , ' reply she .
` Oh , do n't I ? '
he answer .
` Well , it be part of your business , and if you do n't do it , I shall just kill you . '
` Of course I will catch them ! '
cry she in a hurry , and run about the bush after the bird , till thorn pierce her foot , and she shriek from pain and exclaim , ` Oh dear , how unlucky I be !
and how abominably this man be treat me ! '
However , at last she manage to catch the seven bird , and bring them to Mohammed , say , ` Here they be ! '
` Then now we will go back to the house , ' say he .
When they have go some way he turn to her sharply : ` Be quick and drive the sheep home , for I do not know where their fold be . '
And she drive them before her .
By-and-by the young man speak : ` Look here , old hag ; if you say anything to your son about my have strike you , or about my not be the old shepherd , I 'll kill you ! '
` Oh , no , of course I wo n't say anything ! '
When they get back , the son say to his mother : ` That be a good shepherd I 've get , be n't he ? '
` Oh , a splendid shepherd ! '
answer she .
` Why , look how fat the sheep be , and how much milk they give ! '
` Yes , indeed ! '
reply the son , a he rise to get supper for his mother and the shepherd .
In the time of Mohammed 's uncle , the shepherd have have nothing to eat but the scrap leave by the old woman ; but the new shepherd be not go to be content with that .
` You will not touch the food till I have have as much a I want , ' whisper he .
` Very good ! '
reply she .
And when he have have enough , he say : ` Now , eat ! '
But she weep , and cry : ` That be not write in your contract .
You be only to have what I leave ! '
` If you say a word more , I will kill you ! '
say he .
The next day he take the old woman on his back , and drive the sheep in front of him till he be some distance from the house , when he let her fall , and say : ` Quick !
go and mind the sheep ! '
Then he take a ram , and kill it .
He light a fire and broil some of it flesh , and call to the old woman : ` Come and eat with me ! '
and she come .
But instead of let her eat quietly , he take a large lump of the meat and ram it down her throat with his crook , so that she die .
And when he saw she be dead , he say : ` That be what you have get for torment my uncle ! '
and leave her lying where she be , while he go after the singing bird .
It take him a long time to catch them ; but at length he have the whole seven hidden in the pocket of his tunic , and then he throw the old woman 's body into some bush , and drive the sheep before him , back to their fold .
And when they draw near the house the seven boy come to meet him , and he give a bird to each .
` Why be you weep ? '
ask the boy , a they take their bird .
` Because your grandmother be dead ! '
And they run and tell their father .
Then the man come up and say to Mohammed : ` What be the matter ?
How do she die ? '
And Mohammed answer : ' I be tend the sheep when she say to me , `` Kill me that ram ; I be hungry ! ''
So I kill it , and give her the meat .
But she have no teeth , and it choke her . '
` But why do you kill the ram , instead of one of the sheep ? '
ask the man .
` What be I to do ? '
say Mohammed . '
I have to obey order ! '
` Well , I must see to her burial ! '
say the man ; and the next morning Mohammed drive out the sheep a usual , think to himself , ` Thank goodness I 've get rid of the old woman !
Now for the boy ! '
All day long he look after the sheep , and towards even he begin to dig some little hole in the ground , out of which he take six scorpion .
These he put in his pocket , together with one bird which he catch .
After this he drive his flock home .
When he approach the house the boy come out to meet him a before , say : ` Give me my bird ! '
and he put a scorpion into the hand of each , and it sting him , and he die .
But to the young only he give a bird .
As soon a he saw the boy lie dead on the ground , Mohammed lift up his voice and cry loudly : ` Help , help !
the child be dead ! '
And the people come run fast , say : ` What have happen ?
How have they die ? '
And Mohammed answer : ` It be your own fault !
The boy have be accustom to bird , and in this bitter cold their finger grow stiff , and could hold nothing , so that the bird fly away , and their spirit fly with them .
Only the young , who manage to keep tight hold of his bird , be still alive . '
And the father groan , and say , ' I have bear enough !
Bring no more bird , l I lose the young also ! '
` All right , ' say Mohammed .
As he be drive the sheep out to grass he say to his master : ` Out there be a splendid pasture , and I will keep the sheep there for two or , perhaps , three day , so do not be surprise at our absence . '
` Very good ! '
say the man ; and Mohammed start .
For two day he drive them on and on , till he reach his uncle , and say to him , ` Dear uncle , take these sheep and look after them .
I have kill the old woman and the boy , and the flock I have bring to you ! '
Then Mohammed return to his master ; and on the way he take a stone and beat his own head with it till it bleed , and bound his hand tight , and begin to scream .
The master come run and ask , ` What be the matter ? '
And Mohammed answer : ` While the sheep be graze , robber come and drive them away , and because I try to prevent them , they strike me on the head and bound my hand .
See how bloody I be ! '
` What shall we do ? '
say the master ; ` be the animal far off ? '
` So far that you be not likely ever to see them again , ' reply Mohammed .
` This be the fourth day since the robber come down .
How should you be able to overtake them ? '
` Then go and herd the cow ! '
say the man .
` All right ! '
reply Mohammed , and for two day he go .
But on the third day he drive the cow to his uncle , first cut off their tail .
Only one cow he leave behind him .
` Take these cow , dear uncle , ' say he . '
I be go to teach that man a lesson . '
` Well , I suppose you know your own business best , ' say the uncle .
` And certainly he almost worry me to death . '
So Mohammed return to his master , carry the cow ' tail tie up in a bundle on his back .
When he come to the sea-shore , he stick all the tail in the sand , and go and bury the one cow , whose tail he have not cut off , up to her neck , leave the tail projecting .
After he have get everything ready , he begin to shriek and scream a before , till his master and all the other servant come run to see what be the matter .
` What in the world have happen ? '
they cry .
` The sea have swallow up the cow , ' say Mohammed , ` and nothing remains but their tail .
But if you be quick and pull hard , perhaps you may get them out again ! '
The master order each man instantly to take hold of a tail , but at the first pull they nearly tumble backwards , and the tail be leave in their hand .
` Stop , ' cry Mohammed , ` you be do it all wrong .
You have just pull off their tail , and the cow have sink to the bottom of the sea . '
` See if you can do it any good , ' say they ; and Mohammed run to the cow which he have bury in the rough grass , and take hold of her tail and drag the animal out at once .
` There !
that be the way to do it ! '
say he , ' I tell you you know nothing about it ! '
The men slink away , much ashamed of themselves ; but the master come up to Mohammed .
` Get you go ! '
he say , ` there be nothing more for you to do !
You have kill my mother , you have slay my child , you have steal my sheep , you have drown my cow ; I have now no work to give you . '
` First give me the strip of your skin which belong to me of right , a you have break your contract ! '
` That a judge shall decide , ' say the master ; ` we will go before him . '
` Yes , we will , ' reply Mohammed .
And they go before the judge .
` What be your case ? '
ask the judge of the master .
` My lord , ' say the man , bow low , ` my shepherd here have rob me of everything .
He have kill my child and my old mother ; he have steal my sheep , he have drown my cow in the sea . '
The shepherd answer : ` He must pay me what he owe me , and then I will go . '
` Yes , that be the law , ' say the judge .
` Very well , ' return the master , ` let him reckon up how long he have be in my service . '
` That wo n't do , ' reply Mohammed , ' I want my strip of skin , a we agree in the contract . '
Seeing there be no help for it , the master cut a bit of skin , and give it to Mohammed , who go off at once to his uncle .
` Now we be rich , dear uncle , ' cry he , ` we will sell our cow and sheep and go to a new country .
This one be no longer the place for u . '
The sheep be soon sell , and the two comrade start on their travel .
That night they reach some Bedouin tent , where they have supper with the Arabs .
Before they lay down to sleep , Mohammed call the owner of the tent aside .
` Your greyhound will eat my strip of leather , ' he say to the Arab .
` No ; do not fear . '
` But suppose he do ? '
` Well , then , I will give him to you in exchange , ' reply the Arab .
Mohammed wait till everyone be fast asleep , then he rise softly , and tear the bit of skin in piece , throw it down before the greyhound , set up wild shriek a he do so .
` Oh , master , say I not well that your dog would eat my thong ? '
` Be quiet , do n't make such a noise , and you shall have the dog . '
So Mohammed put a leash round his neck , and lead him away .
In the evening they arrive at the tent of some more Bedouin , and ask for shelter .
After supper Mohammed say to the owner of the tent , ` Your ram will kill my greyhound . '
` Oh , no , he wo n't . '
` And suppose he do ? '
` Then you can take him in exchange . '
So in the night Mohammed kill the greyhound , and lay his body across the horn of the ram .
Then he set up shriek and yell , till he rouse the Arab , who say ` Take the ram and go away . '
Mohammed do not need to be tell twice , and at sunset he reach another Bedouin encampment .
He be receive kindly , a usual , and after supper he say to his host : ` Your daughter will kill my ram . '
` Be silent , she will do nothing of the sort ; my daughter do not need to steal meat , she have some every day . '
` Very well , I will go to sleep ; but if anything happen to my ram I will call out . '
` If my daughter touch anything belong to my guest I will kill her , ' say the Arab , and go to his bed .
When everybody be asleep , Mohammed get up , kill the ram , and take out his liver , which he broil on the fire .
He place a piece of it in the girl 's hand , and lay some more on her night-dress while she sleep and know nothing about it .
After this he begin to cry out loudly .
` What be the matter ?
be silent at once ! '
call the Arab .
` How can I be silent , when my ram , which I love like a child , have be slay by your daughter ? '
` But my daughter be asleep , ' say the Arab .

He be therefore completely take by surprise when one day Mohammed tell him with many sigh that the time have now come for him to go to Constantinople , and fix on a profession for himself .
The choice would be leave to him , but he would probably prefer either to be a soldier or one of the doctor learn in the law , who explain the Koran to the ignorant people .
` You know the holy book nearly by heart , ' end the old man , ` so that in a very short time you would be fit to teach others .
But write to u and tell u how you pass your life , and we , on our side , will promise never to forget you . '
So say , Mohammed give Neangir four piastre to start him in the great city , and obtain leave for him to join a caravan which be about to set off for Constantinople .
The journey take some day , a caravan go very slowly , but at last the wall and tower of the capital appear in the distance .
When the caravan halt the traveller go their different way , and Neangir be leave , feel very strange and rather lonely .
He have plenty of courage and make friend very easily ; still , not only be it the first time he have leave the village where he have be bring up , but no one have ever speak to him of Constantinople , and he do not so much a know the name of a single street or of a creature who live in it .
Wondering what he be to do next , Neangir stand still for a moment to look about him , when suddenly a pleasant-looking man come up , and bow politely , ask if the youth would do him the honour of stay in his house till he have make some plan for himself .
Neangir , not see anything else he could do , accept the stranger 's offer and follow him home .
They enter a large room , where a girl of about twelve year old be lay three place at the table .
` Zelida , ' say the stranger , ` be I not quite right when I tell you that I should bring back a friend to sup with u ? '
` My father , ' reply the girl , ` you be always right in what you say , and what be good still , you never mislead others . '
As she speak , an old slave place on the table a dish call pillau , make of rice and meat , which be a great favourite among people in the East , and set down glass of sherbet before each person , leave the room quietly .
During the meal the host talk a great deal upon all sort of subject ; but Neangir do nothing but look at Zelida , as far a he could without be positively rude .
The girl blush and grow uncomfortable , and at last turned to her father .
` The stranger 's eye never wander from me , ' she say in a low and hesitating voice .
` If Hassan should hear of it , jealousy will make him mad . '
` No , no , ' reply the father , ` you be certainly not for this young man .
Did I not tell you before that I intend him for your sister Argentine .
I will at once take measure to fix his heart upon her , ' and he rise and open a cupboard , from which he take some fruit and a jug of wine , which he put on the table , together with a small silver and mother-of-pearl box .
` Taste this wine , ' he say to the young man , pour some into a glass .
` Give me a little , too , ' cry Zelida .
` Certainly not , ' answer her father , ` you and Hassan both have as much a be good for you the other day . '
` Then drink some yourself , ' reply she , ` or this young man will think we mean to poison him . '
` Well , if you wish , I will do so , ' say the father ; ` this elixir be not dangerous at my age , a it be at yours . '
When Neangir have empty his glass , his host open the mother-of-pearl box and hold it out to him .
Neangir be beside himself with delight at the picture of a young maiden more beautiful than anything he have ever dream of .
He stand speechless before it , while his breast swell with a feel quite new to him .
His two companion watch him with amusement , until at last Neangir rouse himself .
` Explain to me , I pray you , ' he say , ` the meaning of these mystery .
Why do you ask me here ?
Why do you force me to drink this dangerous liquid which have set fire to my blood ?
Why have you show me this picture which have almost deprive me of reason ? ' '
I will answer some of your question , ' reply his host , ' but all , I may not .
The picture that you hold in your hand be that of Zelida 's sister .
It have fill your heart with love for her ; therefore , go and seek her .
When you find her , you will find yourself . '
` But where shall I find her ? '
cry Neangir , kiss the charming miniature on which his eye be fix . '
I be unable to tell you more , ' reply his host cautiously .
` But I can , ' interrupt Zelida eagerly .
` To-morrow you must go to the Jewish bazaar , and buy a watch from the second shop on the right hand .
And at midnight -- ' But what be to happen at midnight , Neangir do not hear , for Zelida 's father hastily lay his hand over her mouth , cry : ` Oh , be silent , child !
Would you draw down on you by imprudence the fate of your unhappy sister ? '
Hardly have he utter the word , when a thick black vapour rise about him , proceed from the precious bottle , which his rapid movement have overturn .
The old slave rush in and shriek loudly , while Neangir , upset by this strange adventure , leave the house .
-LSB- Illustration : NEANGIR SEES THE PICTURE OF ARGENTINE -RSB- He pass the rest of the night on the step of a mosque , and with the first streak of dawn he take his picture out of the fold of his turban .
Then , remember Zelida 's word , he inquire the way to the bazaar , and go straight to the shop she have describe .
In answer to Neangir 's request to be show some watch , the merchant produce several and point out the one which he consider the best .
The price be three gold piece , which Neangir readily agree to give him ; but the man make a difficulty about hand over the watch unless he know where his customer live .
` That be more than I know myself , ' reply Neangir . '
I only arrive in the town yesterday and can not find the way to the house where I go first . '
` Well , ' say the merchant , ` come with me , and I will take you to a good Mussulman , where you will have everything you desire at a small charge . '
Neangir consent , and the two walk together through several street till they reach the house recommend by the Jewish merchant .
By his advice the young man pay in advance the last gold piece that remain to him for his food and lodging .
As soon a Neangir have din he shut himself up in his room , and thrust his hand into the fold of his turban , draw out his beloved portrait .
As he do so , he touch a sealed letter which have apparently be hide there without his knowledge , and see it be write by his foster-mother , Zinebi , he tear it eagerly open .
Judge of his surprise when he read these word : ` My dearest Child , -- This letter , which you will some day find in your turban , be to inform you that you be not really our son .
We believe your father to have be a great lord in some distant land , and inside this packet be a letter from him , threaten to be avenge on u if you be not restore to him at once .
We shall always love you , but do not seek u or even write to u .
It will be useless . '
In the same wrapper be a roll of paper with a few word a follow , trace in a hand unknown to Neangir : ` Traitors , you be no doubt in league with those magician who have steal the two daughter of the unfortunate Siroco , and have take from them the talisman give them by their father .
You have keep my son from me , but I have find out your hiding-place and swear by the Holy Prophet to punish your crime .
The stroke of my scimitar be swift than the lightning . '
The unhappy Neangir on read these two letter -- of which he understand absolutely nothing -- felt sadder and more lonely than ever .
It soon dawn on him that he must be the son of the man who have write to Mohammed and his wife , but he do not know where to look for him , and indeed think much more about the people who have bring him up and whom he be never to see again .
To shake off these gloomy feeling , so a to be able to make some plan for the future , Neangir leave the house and walk briskly about the city till darkness have fall .
He then retrace his step and be just cross the threshold when he saw something at his foot sparkle in the moonlight .
He pick it up , and discover it to be a gold watch shin with precious stone .
He gaze up and down the street to see if there be anyone about to whom it might belong , but there be not a creature visible .
So he put it in his sash , by the side of a silver watch which he have buy from the Jew that morning .
The possession of this piece of good fortune cheer Neangir up a little , ` for , ' think he , ' I can sell these jewel for at least a thousand sequins , and that will certainly last me till I have find my father . '
And console by this reflection he lay both watch beside him and prepare to sleep .
In the middle of the night he awake suddenly and hear a soft voice speaking , which seem to come from one of the watch .
` Aurora , my sister , ' it whisper gently .
` Did they remember to wind you up at midnight ? '
` No , dear Argentine , ' be the reply .
` And you ? '
` They forget me , too , ' answer the first voice , ` and it be now one o'clock , so that we shall not be able to leave our prison till to-morrow -- if we be not forget again -- then . '
` We have nothing now to do here , ' say Aurora .
` We must resign ourselves to our fate -- let u go . '
Filled with astonishment Neangir sit up in bed , and beheld by the light of the moon the two watch slide to the ground and roll out of the room past the cat ' quarter .
He rush towards the door and on to the staircase , but the watch slip downstairs without his see them , and into the street .
He try to unlock the door and follow them , but the key refuse to turn , so he give up the chase and go back to bed .
The next day all his sorrow return with tenfold force .
He felt himself lonely and poor than ever , and in a fit of despair he thrust his turban on his head , stick his sword in his belt , and leave the house determine to seek an explanation from the merchant who have sell him the silver watch .
When Neangir reach the bazaar he find the man he seek be absent from his shop , and his place fill by another Jew .
` It be my brother you want , ' say he ; ` we keep the shop in turn , and in turn go into the city to do our business . '
` Ah !
what business ? '
cry Neangir in a fury .
` You be the brother of a scoundrel who sell me yesterday a watch that run away in the night .
But I will find it somehow , or else you shall pay for it , a you be his brother ! '
` What be that you say ? '
ask the Jew , around whom a crowd have rapidly gather . '
A watch that run away .
If it have be a cask of wine , your story might be true , but a watch -- !
That be hardly possible ! '
` The Cadi shall say whether it be possible or not , ' reply Neangir , who at that moment perceive the other Jew enter the bazaar .
Darting up , he seize him by the arm and drag him to the Cadi 's house ; but not before the man whom he have find in the shop contrive to whisper to his brother , in a tone loud enough for Neangir to hear , ` Confess nothing , or we shall both be lose . '
When the Cadi be inform of what have take place he order the crowd to be disperse by blow , after the Turkish manner , and then ask Neangir to state his complaint .
After hear the young man 's story , which seem to him most extraordinary , he turn to question the Jewish merchant , who instead of answer raise his eye to heaven and fell down in a dead faint .
The judge take no notice of the swoon man , but tell Neangir that his tale be so singular he really could not believe it , and that he should have the merchant carry back to his own house .
This so enraged Neangir that he forget the respect due to the Cadi , and exclaim at the top of his voice , ` Recover this fellow from his fainting fit , and force him to confess the truth , ' give the Jew a he speak a blow with his sword which cause him to utter a piercing scream .
` You see for yourself , ' say the Jew to the Cadi , ` that this young man be out of his mind .
I forgive him his blow , but do not , I pray you , leave me in his power . '
At that moment the Bassa chance to pass the Cadi 's house , and hear a great noise , enter to inquire the cause .
When the matter be explain , he look attentively at Neangir , and ask him gently how all these marvel could possibly have happen .
` My lord , ' reply Neangir , ' I swear I have speak the truth , and perhaps you will believe me when I tell you that I myself have be the victim of spell work by people of this kind , who should be root out from the earth .
For three year I be change into a three-legged pot , and only return to man 's shape when one day a turban be lay upon my lid . '
At these word the Bassa rent his robe for joy , and embrace Neangir , he cry , ` Oh , my son , my son , have I find you at last ?
Do you not come from the house of Mohammed and Zinebi ? '
` Yes , my lord , ' reply Neangir , ` it be they who take care of me during my misfortune , and teach me by their example to be less worthy of belong to you . '
` Blessed be the Prophet , ' say the Bassa , ` who have restore one of my son to me , at the time I least expected it !
You know , ' he continue , address the Cadi , ` that during the first year of my marriage I have three son by the beautiful Zambac .
When he be three year old a holy dervish give the eldest a string of the fine coral , say `` Keep this treasure carefully , and be faithful to the Prophet , and you will be happy . ''
To the second , who now stand before you , he present a copper plate on which the name of Mahomet be engrave in seven language , tell him never to part from his turban , which be the sign of a true believer , and he would taste the great of all joy ; while on the right arm of the third the dervish clasp a bracelet with the prayer that his right hand should be pure and the left spotless , so that he might never know sorrow .
` My eldest son neglect the counsel of the dervish and terrible trouble fell on him , a also on the young .
To preserve the second from similar misfortune I bring him up in a lonely place , under the care of a faithful servant name Gouloucou , while I be fight the enemy of our Holy Faith .
On my return from the war I hasten to embrace my son , but both he and Gouloucou have vanish , and it be only a few month since that I learn that the boy be live with a man call Mohammed , whom I suspect of have steal him .
Tell me , my son , how it come about that you fell into his hand . '
` My lord , ' reply Neangir , ' I can remember little of the early year of my life , save that I dwell in a castle by the seashore with an old servant .
I must have be about twelve year old when one day a we be out walk we meet a man whose face be like that of this Jew , come dance towards u .
Suddenly I felt myself grow faint .
I try to raise my hand to my head , but they have become stiff and hard .
In a word , I have be change into a copper pot , and my arm form the handle .
What happen to my companion I know not , but I be conscious that some one have pick me up , and be carry me quickly away .
` After some day , or so it seem to me , I be place on the ground near a thick hedge , and when I hear my captor snore beside me I resolve to make my escape .
So I push my way among the thorn as well a I could , and walk on steadily for about an hour .
` You can not imagine , my lord , how awkward it be to walk with three leg , especially when your knee be as stiff a mine be .
At length after much difficulty I reach a market-garden , and hide myself deep down among the cabbage , where I pass a quiet night .
` The next morning , at sunrise , I felt some one stooping over me and examine me closely .
`` What have you get there , Zinebi ? ''
say the voice of a man a little way off . '
`` The most beautiful pot in the whole world , '' answer the woman beside me , `` and who would have dream of find it among my cabbage ! ''
` Mohammed lift me from the ground and look at me with admiration .
That please me , for every one like to be admire , even if he be only a pot !
And I be take into the house and fill with water , and put on the fire to boil .
` For three year I lead a quiet and useful life , be scrub bright every day by Zinebi , then a young and beautiful woman .
` One morning Zinebi set me on the fire , with a fine fillet of beef inside me to cook , for dinner .
Being afraid that some of the steam would escape through the lid , and that the taste of her stew would be spoil , she look about for something to put over the cover , but could see nothing handy but her husband 's turban .
She tie it firmly round the lid , and then leave the room .
For the first time during three year I begin to feel the fire burn the sol of my foot , and move away a little -- do this with a great deal more ease than I have felt when make my escape to Mohammed 's garden .
I be somehow aware , too , that I be grow taller ; in fact in a few minute I be a man again .
-LSB- Illustration : ZINEBI PUTS THE TURBAN ON THE POT -RSB- ` After the third hour of prayer Mohammed and Zinebi both return , and you can guess their surprise at find a young man in the kitchen instead of a copper pot !
I tell them my story , which at first they refuse to believe , but in the end I succeed in persuade them that I be speak the truth .
For two year more I live with them , and be treat like their own son , till the day when they send me to this city to seek my fortune .
And now , my lord , here be the two letter which I find in my turban .
Perhaps they may be another proof in favour of my story . '
Whilst Neangir be speak , the blood from the Jew 's wound have gradually cease to flow ; and at this moment there appear in the doorway a lovely Jewess , about twenty-two year old , her hair and her dress all disorder , a if she have be fly from some great danger .
In one hand she hold two crutch of white wood , and be follow by two men .
The first man Neangir know to be the brother of the Jew he have strike with his sword , while in the second the young man think he recognise the person who be stand by when he be change into a pot .
Both of these men have a wide linen band round their thigh and hold stout stick .
-LSB- Illustration : THERE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY A LOVELY JEWESS -RSB- The Jewess approach the wounded man and lay the two crutch near him ; then , fix her eye on him , she burst into tear .
` Unhappy Izouf , ' she murmur , ` why do you suffer yourself to be lead into such dangerous adventure ?
Look at the consequence , not only to yourself , but to your two brother , ' turn a she speak to the men who have come in with her , and who have sink down on the mat at the foot of the Jew .
The Bassa and his companion be strike both with the beauty of the Jewess and also with her word , and beg her to give them an explanation .
` My lord , ' she say , ` my name be Sumi , and I be the daughter of Moïzes , one of our most famous rabbi .
I be the victim of my love for Izaf , ' point to the man who have enter last , ` and in spite of his ingratitude , I can not tear him from my heart .
Cruel enemy of my life , ' she continue , turn to Izaf , ` tell these gentleman your story and that of your brother , and try to gain your pardon by repentance . '
` We all three be bear at the same time , ' say the Jew , obey the command of Sumi at a sign from the Cadi , ` and be the son of the famous Nathan Ben-Sadi , who give u the name of Izif , Izouf , and Izaf .
From our early year we be teach the secret of magic , and a we be all bear under the same star we share the same happiness and the same trouble .
` Our mother die before I can remember , and when we be fifteen our father be seize with a dangerous illness which no spell could cure .
Feeling death draw near , he call u to his bedside and take leave of u in these word : ' `` My son , I have no rich to bequeath to you ; my only wealth be those secret of magic which you know .
Some stone you already have , engrave with mystic sign , and long ago I teach you how to make others .
But you still lack the most precious of all talisman -- the three ring belong to the daughter of Siroco .
Try to get possession of them , but take heed on behold these young girl that you do not fall under the power of their beauty .
Their religion be different from yours , and far , they be the betrothed bride of the son of the Bassa of the Sea .
And to preserve you from a love which can bring you nothing but sorrow , I counsel you in time of peril to seek out the daughter of Moïzes the Rabbi , who cherish a hidden passion for Izaf , and possess the Book of Spells , which her father himself write with the sacred ink that be use for the Talmud . ''
So say , our father fell back on his cushion and die , leave u burn with desire for the three ring of the daughter of Siroco .
` No sooner be our sad duty finish than we begin to make inquiry where these young lady be to be find , and we learn after much trouble that Siroco , their father , have fight in many war , and that his daughter , whose beauty be famous throughout all the land , be name Aurora , Argentine , and Zelida . '
At the second of these name , both the Bassa and his son give a start of surprise , but they say nothing , and Izaf go on with his story .
` The first thing to be do be to put on a disguise , and it be in the dress of foreign merchant that we at length approach the young lady , take care to carry with u a collection of fine stone which we have hire for the occasion .
But ala !
it be to no purpose that Nathan Ben-Sadi have warn u to close our heart against their charm !
The peerless Aurora be clothe in a garment of golden hue , stud all over with flashing jewel ; the fair-haired Argentine wear a dress of silver , and the young Zelida , lovely of them all , the costume of a Persian lady .
` Among other curiosity that we have bring with u , be a flask contain an elixir which have the quality of excite love in the breast of any man or woman who drink of it .
This have be give me by the fair Sumi , who have use it herself and be full of wrath because I refuse to drink it likewise , and so return her passion .
I show this liquid to the three maiden who be engage in examine the precious stone , and choose those that please them best ; and I be in the act of pour some in a crystal cup , when Zelida 's eye fell on a paper wrap round the flask contain these word : `` Beware l you drink this water with any other man than him who will one day be your husband . ''
`` Ah , traitor ! ''
she exclaim , `` what snare have you lay for me ? ''
and glance where her finger point I recognise the writing of Sumi .
-LSB- Illustration : ZELIDA DISCOVERS THE WRITING ON THE FLASK -RSB- ` By this time my two brother have already get possession of the ring of Aurora and Argentine in exchange for some merchandise which they covet , and no sooner have the magic circle leave their hand than the two sister vanish completely , and in their place nothing be to be see but a watch of gold and one of silver .
At this instant the old slave whom we have bribe to let u enter the house , rush into the room announce the return of Zelida 's father .
My brother , tremble with fright , hid the watch in their turban , and while the slave be attend to Zelida , who have sunk fainting to the ground , we manage to make our escape .
` Fearing to be trace by the enraged Siroco , we do not dare to go back to the house where we lodge , but take refuge with Sumi . '
`` Unhappy wretch ! ''
cry she , `` be it thus that you have follow the counsel of your father ?
This very morning I consult my magic book , and saw you in the act of abandon your heart to the fatal passion which will one day be your ruin .
No , do not think I will tamely bear this insult !
It be I who write the letter which stop Zelida in the act of drink the elixir of love !
As for you , '' she go on , turn to my brother , `` you do not yet know what those two watch will cost you !
But you can learn it now , and the knowledge of the truth will only serve to render your life still more miserable . ''
` As she speak she hold out the sacred book write by Moïzes , and point to the following line : ' `` If at midnight the watch be wound with the key of gold and the key of silver , they will resume their proper shape during the first hour of the day .
They will always remain under the care of a woman , and will come back to her wherever they may be .
And the woman appoint to guard them be the daughter of Moïzes . ''
` My brother be full of rage when they saw themselves outwit , but there be no help for it .
The watch be deliver up to Sumi and they go their way , while I remain behind curious to see what would happen .
` As night wore on Sumi wind up both watch , and when midnight strike Aurora and her sister make their appearance .
They know nothing of what have occur and suppose they have just awaken from sleep , but when Sumi 's story make them understand their terrible fate , they both sob with despair and be only console when Sumi promise never to forsake them .
Then one o'clock sound , and they become watch again .
` All night long I be a prey to vague fear , and I felt a if something unseen be push me on -- in what direction I do not know .
At dawn I rise and go out , meet Izif in the street suffer from the same dread a myself .
We agree that Constantinople be no place for u any long , and call to Izouf to accompany u , we leave the city together , but soon determine to travel separately , so that we might not be so easily recognise by the spy of Siroco . '
A few day later I find myself at the door of an old castle near the sea , before which a tall slave be pace to and fro .
The gift of one or two worthless jewel loosen his tongue , and he inform me that he be in the service of the son of the Bassa of the Sea , at that time make war in distant country .
The youth , he tell me , have be destine from his boyhood to marry the daughter of Siroco , whose sister be to be the bride of his brother , and go on to speak of the talisman that his charge possess .
But I could think of nothing but the beautiful Zelida , and my passion , which I think I have conquer , awoke in full force .
` In order to remove this dangerous rival from my path , I resolve to kidnap him , and to this end I begin to act a madman , and to sing and dance loudly , cry to the slave to fetch the boy and let him see my trick .
He consent , and both be so divert with my antic that they laugh till the tear run down their cheek , and even try to imitate me .
Then I declare I felt thirsty and beg the slave to fetch me some water , and while he be absent I advise the youth to take off his turban , so a to cool his head .
He comply gladly , and in the twinkling of an eye be change into a pot .
A cry from the slave warn me that I have no time to lose if I would save my life , so I snatch up the pot and flee with it like the wind .
` You have hear , my lord , what become of the pot , so I will only say now that when I awake it have disappear ; but I be partly console for it loss by find my two brother fast asleep not far from me .
`` How do you get here ? ''
I inquire , `` and what have happen to you since we part ? '' '
`` Alas ! ''
reply Izouf , `` we be pass a wayside inn from which come sound of song and laughter , and fool that we be -- we enter and sit down .
Circassian girl of great beauty be dance for the amusement of several men , who not only receive u politely , but place u near the two lovely maiden .
Our happiness be complete , and time fly unknown to u , when one of the Circassians lean forward and say to her sister , ` Their brother dance , and they must dance too . '
What they mean by these word I know not , but perhaps you can tell u ? '' '
`` I understand quite well , '' I reply .
`` They be think of the day that I steal the son of the Bassa , and have dance before him . '' '
`` Perhaps you be right , '' continue Izouf , `` for the two lady take our hand and dance with u till we be quite exhaust , and when at last we sit down a second time to table we drink more wine than be good for u .
Indeed , our head grow so confused , that when the men jump up and threaten to kill u , we could make no resistance and suffer ourselves to be rob of everything we have about u , include the most precious possession of all , the two talisman of the daughter of Siroco . ''
` Not know what else to do , we all three return to Constantinople to ask the advice of Sumi , and find that she be already aware of our misfortune , have read about them in the book of Moïzes .
The kind-hearted creature weep bitterly at our story , but , be poor herself , could give u little help .
At last I propose that every morning we should sell the silver watch into which Argentine be change , a it would return to Sumi every evening unless it be wind up with the silver key -- which be not at all likely .
Sumi consent , but only on the condition that we would never sell the watch without ascertain the house where it be to be find , so that she might also take Aurora thither , and thus Argentine would not be alone if by any chance she be wind up at the mystic hour .
For some week now we have live by this mean , and the two daughter of Siroco have never fail to return to Sumi each night .
Yesterday Izouf sell the silver watch to this young man , and in the evening place the gold watch on the step by order of Sumi , just before his customer enter the house ; from which both watch come back early this morning . '
` If I have only know ! '
cry Neangir .
` If I have have more presence of mind , I should have see the lovely Argentine , and if her portrait be so fair , what must the original be ! '
` It be not your fault , ' reply the Cadi , ` you be no magician ; and who could guess that the watch must be wind at such an hour ?
But I shall give order that the merchant be to hand it over to you , and this evening you will certainly not forget . '
` It be impossible to let you have it to-day , ' answer Izouf , ` for it be already sell . '
` If that be so , ' say the Cadi , ` you must return the three gold piece which the young man pay . '
The Jew , delight to get off so easily , put his hand in his pocket , when Neangir stop him .
` No , no , ' he exclaim , ` it be not money I want , but the adorable Argentine ; without her everything be valueless . '
` My dear Cadi , ' say the Bassa , ` he be right .
The treasure that my son have lose be absolutely priceless . '
` My lord , ' reply the Cadi , ` your wisdom be great than mine .
Give judgment I pray you in the matter . '
So the Bassa desire them all to accompany him to his house , and command his slave not to lose sight of the three Jewish brother .
When they arrive at the door of his dwelling , he notice two woman sit on a bench close by , thickly veil and beautifully dress .
Their wide satin trouser be embroider in silver , and their muslin robe be of the fine texture .
In the hand of one be a bag of pink silk tie with green ribbon , contain something that seem to move .
At the approach of the Bassa both lady rise , and come towards him .
Then the one who hold the bag address him say , ` Noble lord , buy , I pray you , this bag , without ask to see what it contain . '
` How much do you want for it ? '
ask the Bassa .
` Three hundred sequin , ' reply the unknown .
At these word the Bassa laugh contemptuously , and pass on without speaking .
-LSB- Illustration : The BASSA laugh at the CIRCASSIANS -RSB- ` You will not repent of your bargain , ' go on the woman .
` Perhaps if we come back to-morrow you will be glad to give u the four hundred sequin we shall then ask .
And the next day the price will be five hundred . '
` Come away , ' say her companion , take hold of her sleeve .
` Do not let u stay here any long .
It may cry , and then our secret will be discover . '
And so saying , the two young woman disappear .
The Jews be leave in the front hall under the care of the slave , and Neangir and Sumi follow the Bassa inside the house , which be magnificently furnish .
At one end of a large , brilliantly-lighted room a lady of about thirty-five year old recline on a couch , still beautiful in spite of the sad expression of her face .
` Incomparable Zambac , ' say the Bassa , go up to her , ` give me your thanks , for here be the lost son for whom you have shed so many tear , ' but before his mother could clasp him in her arm Neangir have fling himself at her foot .
` Let the whole house rejoice with me , ' continue the Bassa , ` and let my two son Ibrahim and Hassan be tell , that they may embrace their brother . '
` Alas !
my lord ! '
say Zambac , ` do you forget that this be the hour when Hassan weep on his hand , and Ibrahim gather up his coral bead ? '
` Let the command of the prophet be obey , ' reply the Bassa ; ` then we will wait till the evening . '
` Forgive me , noble lord , ' interrupted Sumi , ` but what be this mystery ?
With the help of the Book of Spells perhaps I may be of some use in the matter . '
` Sumi , ' answer the Bassa , ' I owe you already the happiness of my life ; come with me then , and the sight of my unhappy son will tell you of our trouble well than any word of mine . '
The Bassa rise from his divan and draw aside the hanging lead to a large hall , closely follow by Neangir and Sumi .
There they saw two young men , one about seventeen , and the other nineteen year of age .
The younger be seat before a table , his forehead resting on his right hand , which he be water with his tear .
He raise his head for a moment when his father enter , and Neangir and Sumi both saw that this hand be of ebony .
The other young man be occupy busily in collect coral bead which be scatter all over the floor of the room , and a he pick them up he place them on the same table where his brother be sit .
He have already gather together ninety-eight bead , and think they be all there , when they suddenly roll off the table and he have to begin his work over again .
` Do you see , ' whisper the Bassa , ` for three hour daily one collect these coral bead , and for the same space of time the other lament over his hand which have become black , and I be wholly ignorant what be the cause of either misfortune . '
` Do not let u stay here , ' say Sumi , ` our presence must add to their grief .
But permit me to fetch the Book of Spells , which I feel sure will tell u not only the cause of their malady but also it cure . '
The Bassa readily agree to Sumi 's proposal , but Neangir object strongly .
` If Sumi leave u , ' he say to his father , ' I shall not see my beloved Argentine when she return to-night with the fair Aurora .
And life be an eternity till I behold her . '
` Be comfort , ' reply Sumi . '
I will be back before sunset ; and I leave you my adored Izaf a a pledge . '
Scarcely have the Jewess leave Neangir , when the old female slave enter the hall where the three Jews still remain carefully guard , follow by a man whose splendid dress prevent Neangir from recognise at first a the person in whose house he have din two day before .
But the woman he know at once to be the nurse of Zelida .
He start eagerly forward , but before he have time to speak the slave turn to the soldier she be conduct .
` My lord , ' she say , ` those be the men ; I have track them from the house of the Cadi to this palace .
They be the same ; I be not mistake , strike and avenge yourself . '
As he listen the face of the stranger grow scarlet with anger .
He draw his sword and in another moment would have rush on the Jews , when Neangir and the slave of the Bassa seize hold of him .
` What be you do ? '
cry Neangir .
` How dare you attack those whom the Bassa have take under his protection ? '
` Ah , my son , ' reply the soldier , ` The Bassa would withdraw his protection if he know that these wretch have rob me of all I have dearest in the world .
He know them as little a he know you . '
` But he know me very well , ' reply Neangir , ` for he have recognise me a his son .
Come with me now , into his presence . '
The stranger bow and pass through the curtain hold back by Neangir , whose surprise be great at see his father spring forward and clasp the soldier in his arm .
` What !
be it you , my dear Siroco ? '
cry he . '
I believe you have be slay in that awful battle when the follower of the Prophet be put to flight .
But why do your eye kindle with the flame they shoot forth on that fearful day ?
Calm yourself and tell me what I can do to help you .
See , I have find my son , let that be a good omen for your happiness also . ' '
I do not guess , ' answer Siroco , ` that the son you have so long mourn have come back to you .
Some day since the Prophet appear to me in a dream , float in a circle of light , and he say to me , `` Go to-morrow at sunset to the Galata Gate , and there you will find a young man whom you must bring home with you .
He be the second son of your old friend the Bassa of the Sea , and that you may make no mistake , put your finger in his turban and you will feel the plate on which my name be engrave in seven different language . '' '
I do a I be bid , ' go on Siroco , ` and so charm be I with his face and manner that I cause him to fall in love with Argentine , whose portrait I give him .
But at the moment when I be rejoice in the happiness before me , and look forward to the pleasure of restore you your son , some drop of the elixir of love be spill on the table , and cause a thick vapour to arise , which hide everything .
When it have clear away he be go .
This morning my old slave inform me that she have discover the traitor who have steal my daughter from me , and I hasten hither to avenge them .
But I place myself in your hand , and will follow your counsel . '
` Fate will favour u , I be sure , ' say the Bassa , ` for this very night I expect to secure both the silver and the gold watch .
So send at once and pray Zelida to join u . '
A rustling of silken stuff draw their eye to the door , and Ibrahim and Hassan , whose daily penance have by this time be perform , enter to embrace their brother .
Neangir and Hassan , who have also drunk of the elixir of love , could think of nothing but the beautiful lady who have capture their heart , while the spirit of Ibrahim have be cheer by the news that the daughter of Moïzes hop to find in the Book of Spells some charm to deliver him from collect the magic bead .
It be some hour later that Sumi return , bring with her the sacred book .
` See , ' she say , beckon to Hassan , ` your destiny be write here . '
And Hassan stoop and read these word in Hebrew : ` His right hand have become black a ebony from touch the fat of an impure animal , and will remain so till the last of it race be drown in the sea . '
-LSB- Illustration : SUMI · SHOWS · HASSAN · THE · BOOK · OF · MAGIC -RSB- ` Alas ! '
sigh the unfortunate youth .
` It now come back to my memory .
One day the slave of Zambac be make a cake .
She warn me not to touch , a the cake be mixed with lard , but I do not heed her , and in an instant my hand become the ebony that it now be . '
` Holy dervish ! '
exclaim the Bassa , ` how true be your word !
My son have neglect the advice you give him on present him the bracelet , and he have be severely punish .
But tell me , O wise Sumi , where I can find the last of the accursed race who have bring this doom on my son ? '
` It be write here , ' reply Sumi , turn over some leaf .
` The little black pig be in the pink bag carry by the two Circassians . '
When he read this the Bassa sank on his cushion in despair .
` Ah , ' he say , ` that be the bag that be offer me this morning for three hundred sequin .
Those must be the woman who cause Izif and Izouf to dance , and take from them the two talisman of the daughter of Siroco .
They only can break the spell that have be cast on u .
Let them be find and I will gladly give them the half of my possession .
Idiot that I be to send them away ! '
While the Bassa be bewail his folly , Ibrahim in his turn have open the book , and blush deeply a he read the word : ` The chaplet of bead have be defile by the game of `` Odd and Even . ''
Its owner have try to cheat by conceal one of the number .
Let the faithless Moslem seek for ever the miss bead . ' '
O heaven , ' cry Ibrahim , ` that unhappy day rise up before me .
I have cut the thread of the chaplet , while play with Aurora .
Holding the ninety-nine bead in my hand she guess `` Odd , '' and in order that she might lose I let one bead fall from my hand .
Since then I have seek it daily , but it never have be find . '
` Holy dervish ! '
cry the Bassa , ` how true be your word !
From the time that the sacred chaplet be no long complete , my son have bear the penalty .
But may not the Book of Spells teach u how to deliver Ibrahim also ? '
` Listen , ' say Sumi , ` this be what I find : `` The coral bead lie in the fifth fold of the dress of yellow brocade . '' '
` Ah , what good fortune ! '
exclaim the Bassa , ` we shall shortly see the beautiful Aurora , and Ibrahim shall at once search in the fifth fold of her yellow brocade .
For it be she no doubt of whom the book speaks . '
As the Jewess close the Book of Moïzes , Zelida appear , accompany by a whole train of slave and her old nurse .
At her entrance Hassan , beside himself with joy , flung himself on his knee and kiss her hand .
` My lord , ' he say to the Bassa , ` pardon me these transport .
No elixir of love be need to inflame my heart !
Let the marriage rite make u speedily one . '
` My son , be you mad ? '
ask the Bassa .
` As long a the misfortune of your brother last , shall you alone be happy .
And whoever heard of a bridegroom with a black hand ?
Wait yet a little long , till the black pig be drown in the sea . '
` Yes !
dear Hassan , ' say Zelida , ` our happiness will be increase tenfold when my sister have regain their proper shape .
And here be the elixir which I have bring with me , so that their joy may equal ours . '
And she hold out the flask to the Bassa , who have it close in his presence .
Zambac be fill with joy at the sight of Zelida , and embrace her with delight .
Then she lead the way into the garden , and invite all her friend to seat themselves under the thick overhang branch of a splendid jessamine tree .
No sooner , however , be they comfortably settle , than they be astonish to hear a man 's voice , speak angrily on the other side of the wall .
` Ungrateful girl ! '
it say , ` be this the way you treat me ?
Let me hide myself for ever !
This cave be no longer dark enough or deep enough for me . '
A burst of laughter be the only answer , and the voice continue , ` What have I do to earn such contempt ?
Was this what you promise me when I manage to get for you the talisman of beauty ?
Is this the reward I have a right to expect when I have bestow on you the little black pig , who be certain to bring you good luck ? '
At these word the curiosity of the listener pass all bound , and the Bassa command his slave instantly to tear down the wall .
It be do , but the man be nowhere to be see , and there be only two girl of extraordinary beauty , who seem quite at their ease , and come dance gaily on to the terrace .
With them be an old slave in whom the Bassa recognise Gouloucou , the former guardian of Neangir .
-LSB- Illustration : THE CIRCASSIANS DANCE INTO THE BASSA 'S GARDEN -RSB- Gouloucou shrank with fear when he saw the Bassa , a he expect nothing less than death at his hand for allow Neangir to be snatch away .
But the Bassa make him sign of forgiveness , and ask him how he have escape death when he have throw himself from the cliff .
Gouloucou explain that he have be pick up by a dervish who have cure his wound , and have then give him as slave to the two young lady now before the company , and in their service he have remain ever since .
` But , ' say the Bassa , ` where be the little black pig of which the voice speak just now ? '
` My lord , ' answer one of the lady , ` when at your command the wall be throw down , the man whom you hear speak be so frighten at the noise that he catch up the pig and run away . '
` Let him be pursue instantly , ' cry the Bassa ; but the lady smile .
` Do not be alarm , my lord , ' say one , ` he be sure to return .
Only give order that the entrance to the cave shall be guard , so that when he be once in he shall not get out again . '
By this time night be fall and they all go back to the palace , where coffee and fruit be serve in a splendid gallery , near the woman 's apartment .
The Bassa then order the three Jews to be bring before him , so that he might see whether these be the two damsel who have force them to dance at the inn , but to his great vexation it be find that when their guard have go to knock down the wall the Jews have escape .
At this news the Jewess Sumi turn pale , but glance at the Book of Spells her face brighten , and she say half aloud , ` There be no cause for disquiet ; they will capture the dervish , ' while Hassan lament loudly that as soon a fortune appear on one side she flee on the other !
On hear this reflection one of the Bassa 's page break into a laugh .
` This fortune come to u dance , my lord , ' say he , ` and the other leave u on crutch .
Do not be afraid .
She will not go very far . '
The Bassa , shock at his impertinent interference , desire him to leave the room and not to come back till he be send for .
` My lord shall be obey , ' say the page , ` but when I return , it shall be in such good company that you will welcome me gladly . '
So say , he go out .
When they be alone , Neangir turn to the fair stranger and implore their help .
` My brother and myself , ' he cry , ` be fill with love for three peerless maiden , two of whom be under a cruel spell .
If their fate happen to be in your hand , would you not do all in your power to restore them to happiness and liberty ? '
But the young man 's appeal only stir the two lady to anger .
` What , ' exclaim one , ` be the sorrow of lover to u ?
Fate have deprive u of our lover , and if it depend on u the whole world shall suffer as much a we do ! '
This unexpected reply be hear with amazement by all present , and the Bassa entreat the speaker to tell them her story .
Having obtain permission of her sister , she begin : THE STORY OF THE FAIR CIRCASSIANS ` We be bear in Circassia of poor people , and my sister 's name be Tezila and mine Dely .
Having nothing but our beauty to help u in life , we be carefully train in all the accomplishment that give pleasure .
We be both quick to learn , and from our childhood could play all sort of instrument , could sing , and above all could dance .
We be , besides , lively and merry , a in spite of our misfortune we be to this day .
` We be easily pleased and quite content with our life at home , when one morning the official who have be send to find wife for the Sultan saw u , and be strike with our beauty .
We have always expect something of the sort , and be resign to our lot , when we chance to see two young men enter our house .
The elder , who be about twenty year of age , have black hair and very bright eye .
The other could not have be more than fifteen , and be so fair that he might easily have pass for a girl .
` They knock at the door with a timid air and beg our parent to give them shelter , a they have lose their way .
After some hesitation their request be grant , and they be invite into the room in which we be .
And if our parent ' heart be touch by their beauty , our own be not any harder , so that our departure for the palace , which have be arrange for the next day , suddenly become intolerable to u .
` Night come , and I awake from my sleep to find the young of the two stranger sit at my bedside and felt him take my hand . '
`` Fear nothing , lovely Dely , '' he whisper , `` from one who never know love till he saw you .
My name , '' he go on , `` be Prince Delicate , and I be the son of the King of the Isle of Black Marble .
My friend , who travel with me , be one of the rich noble of my country , and the secret which he know be the envy of the Sultan himself .
And we leave our native country because my father wish me to marry a lady of great beauty , but with one eye a trifle small than the other . ''
` My vanity be flatter at so speedy a conquest , and I be charm with the way the young man have declare his passion .
I turn my eye slowly on him , and the look I give him cause him almost to lose his sens .
He fell faint forward , and I be unable to move till Tezila , who have hastily put on a dress , run to my assistance together with Thelamis , the young noble of whom the Prince have speak .
` As soon a we be all ourselves again we begin to bewail our fate , and the journey that we be to take that very day to Constantinople .
But we felt a little comforted when Thelamis assure u that he and the prince would follow in our step , and would somehow contrive to speak to u .
Then they kiss our hand , and leave the house by a side-way . '
A few moment later our parent come to tell u that the escort have arrive , and have take farewell of them we mount the camel , and take our seat in a kind of box that be fix to the side of the animal .
These box be large enough for u to sleep in comfortably , and a there be a window in the upper part , we be able to see the country through which we pass .
` For several day we journey on , feel sad and anxious a to what might become of u , when one day a I be look out of the window of our room , I hear my name call , and behold a beautifully dress girl jump out of the box on the other side of our camel .
One glance tell me that it be the prince , and my heart bound with joy .
It be , he say , Thelamis 's idea to disguise him like this , and that he himself have assume the character of a slave-dealer who be take this peerless maiden a a present to the Sultan .
Thelamis have also persuade the officer in charge of the caravan to let him hire the vacant box , so it be easy for the prince to scramble out of his own window and approach ours .
` This ingenious trick enchant u , but our agreeable conversation be soon interrupt by the attendant , who perceive that the camel be walk in a crooked manner and come to find out what be wrong .
Luckily they be slow in their movement , and the prince have just time to get back to his own box and restore the balance , before the trick be discover .
` But neither the prince nor his friend have any intention of allow u to enter the Sultan 's palace , though it be difficult to know how we be to escape , and what be to become of u when once we have escape .
At length , one day a we be draw near Constantinople , we learn from the prince that Thelamis have make acquaintance with a holy dervish whom he have meet on the road , and have inform him that we be his sister , who be be sell a slave against his will .
The good man be interested in the story , and readily agree to find u shelter if we could manage to elude the watchfulness of our guard .
The risk be great , but it be our only chance .
` That night , when the whole caravan be fast asleep , we raise the upper part of our box and by the help of Thelamis climb silently out .
We next go back some distance along the way we have come , then , strike into another road , reach at last the retreat prepare for u by the dervish .
Here we find food and rest , and I need not say what happiness it be to be free once more .
` The dervish soon become a slave to our beauty , and the day after our escape he propose that we should allow him to conduct u to an inn situate at a short distance , where we should find two Jews , owner of precious talisman which do not really belong to them .
`` Try , '' say the dervish , `` by some mean to get possession of them . ''
` The inn , though not on the direct road to Constantinople , be a favourite one with merchant , owe to the excellence of the food , and on our arrival we discover at least six or eight other people who have stop for refreshment .
They greet u politely , and we sit down to table together .
` In a short time the two men describe by the dervish enter the room , and at a sign from him my sister make room at her side for one , while I do the same for the other .
` Now the dervish have happen to mention that `` their brother have dance . ''
At the moment we pay no attention to this remark , but it come back to our mind now , and we determine that they should dance also .
To accomplish this we use all our art and very soon bend them to our will , so that they could refuse u nothing .
At the end of the day we remain possessor of the talisman and have leave them to their fate , while the Prince and Thelamis fell more in love with u than ever , and declare that we be more lovely than any woman in the world .
` The sun have set before we quit the inn , and we have make no plan a to where we should go next , so we readily consent to the prince 's proposal that we should embark without delay for the Isle of Black Marble .
What a place it be !
Rocks blacker than jet tower above it shore and shed thick darkness over the country .
Our sailor have not be there before and be nearly as frightened a ourselves , but thanks to Thelamis , who undertake to be our pilot , we land safely on the beach .
` When we have leave the coast behind u , with it wall of jet , we enter a lovely country where the field be greener , the stream clearer , and the sun brighter than anywhere else .
The people crowd round to welcome their prince , whom they love dearly , but they tell him that the king be still full of rage at his son 's refusal to marry his cousin the Princess Okimpare , and also at his flight .
Indeed , they all beg him not to visit the capital , a his life would hardly be safe .
So , much a I should have enjoy see the home of my beloved prince , I implore him to listen to this wise advice and to let u all go to Thelamis 's palace in the middle of a vast forest .
` To my sister and myself , who have be bring up in a cottage , this house of Thelamis 's seem like fairyland .
It be build of pink marble , so highly polished that the flower and stream surround it be reflect a in a mirror .
One set of room be furnish especially for me in yellow silk and silver , to suit my black hair .
Fresh dress be provide for u every day , and we have slave to wait on u .
Ah , why could not this happiness have last for ever !
` The peace of our life be trouble by Thelamis 's jealousy of my sister , a he could not endure to see her on friendly term with the prince , though know full well that his heart be mine .
Every day we have scene of tender reproach and of explanation , but Tezila 's tear never fail to bring Thelamis to his knee , with prayer for forgiveness .
` We have be live in this way for some month when one day the news come that the king have fall dangerously ill .
I beg the prince to hurry at once to the court , both to see his father and also to show himself to the senator and noble , but a his love for me be great than his desire of a crown , he hesitate a if foresee all that afterwards happen .
At last Tezila speak to him so seriously in Thelamis 's presence , that he determine to go , but promise that he would return before night .
` Night come but no prince , and Tezila , who have be the cause of his departure , show such sign of uneasiness that Thelamis 's jealousy be at once awaken .
As for me , I can not tell what I suffer .
Not be able to sleep I rise from my bed and wander into the forest , along the road which he have take so many hour before .
Suddenly I hear in the distance the sound of a horse 's hoof , and in a few moment the prince have fling himself down and be by my side .
`` Ah , how I adore you ! ''
he exclaim , `` Thelamis 's love will never equal mine . ''
The word be hardly out of his mouth when I hear a slight noise behind , and before we could turn round both our head be roll in front of u , while the voice of Thelamis cry : ' `` Perjured wretch , answer me ; and you , faithless Tezila , tell me why you have betray me like this ? ''
` Then I understand what have happen , and that in his rage , he have mistake me for my sister . '
`` Alas , '' reply my head in weak tone , `` I be not Tezila , but Dely , whose life you have destroy , as well a that of your friend . ''
At this Thelamis pause and seem to reflect for an instant . '
`` Be not frighten , '' he say more quietly , `` I can make you whole again , '' and lay a magic powder on our tongue he place our head on our neck .
In the twinkling of an eye our head be join to our body without leave so much a a scar ; only that , blind with rage a he still be , Thelamis have place my head on the prince 's body , and his on mine !
-LSB- Illustration : THE WRONG HEADS ON THE WRONG BODIES -RSB- ' I can not describe to you how odd we both felt at this strange transformation .
We both instinctively put up our hand -- he to feel his hair , which be , of course , dress like a woman , and I to raise the turban which press heavily on my forehead .
But we do not know what have happen to u , for the night be still dark .
` At this point Tezila appear , follow by a troop of slave bear flower .
It be only by the light of their torch that we understand what have occur .
Indeed the first thought of both of u be that we must have change clothes .
` Now in spite of what we may say , we all prefer our own body to those of anybody else , so notwithstanding our love for each other , at first we could not help feel a little cross with Thelamis .
However , so deep be the prince 's passion for me , that very soon he begin to congratulate himself on the change .
`` My happiness be perfect , '' he say , `` my heart , beautiful Dely , have always be yours , and now I have your head also . ''
` But though the prince make the best of it , Thelamis be much ashamed of his stupidity .
`` I have , '' he say hesitatingly , `` two other pastille which have the same magic property a those I use before .
Let me cut off your head again , and that will put matter straight . ''
The proposal sound tempting , but be a little risky , and after consult together we decide to let thing remain a they be .
`` Do not blame me then , '' continue Thelamis , `` if you will not accept my offer .
But take the two pastille , and if it ever happen that you be decapitate a second time , make use of them in the way I have show you , and each will get back his own head . ''
So say he present u with the pastille , and we all return to the castle .
` However , the trouble cause by the unfortunate exchange be only just begin .
My head , without think what it be do , lead the prince 's body to my apartment .
But my woman , only look at the dress , declare I have mistake the corridor , and call some slave to conduct me to his Highness 's room .
This be bad enough , but when -- a it be still night -- my servant begin to undress me , I nearly faint from surprise and confusion , and no doubt the Prince 's head be suffer in the same manner at the other end of the castle !
` By the next morning -- you will easily guess that we sleep but little -- we have grow partly accustom to our strange situation , and when we look in the mirror , the prince have become brown-skinned and black-haired , while my head be cover with his curly golden lock .
And after that first day , every one in the palace have become so accustomed to the change that they think no more about it .
` Some week after this , we hear that the king of the Isle of Black Marble be dead .
The prince 's head , which once be mine , be full of ambitious desire , and he long to ride straight to the capital and proclaim himself king .
But then come the question a to whether the noble would recognise the prince with a girl 's body , and indeed , when we come to think of it , which be prince and which be girl ?
` At last , after much argument , my head carry the day and we set out ; but only to find that the king have declare the Princess Okimpare his successor .
The great part of the senator and noble openly profess that they would much have prefer the rightful heir , but a they could not recognise him either in the Prince or me , they choose to consider u a impostor and throw u into prison . '
A few day later Tezila and Thelamis , who have follow u to the capital , come to tell u that the new queen have accuse u of high treason , and have herself be present at our trial -- which be conduct without u .
They have be in mortal terror a to what would be our sentence , but by a piece of extraordinary luck we have be condemn to be behead . '
I tell my sister that I do not see exactly where the luck come in , but Thelamis interrupt me rudely : ' `` What ! ''
he cry , `` of course I shall make use of the pastille , and -- '' but here the officer arrive to lead u to the great square where the execution be to take place -- for Okimpare be determine there should be no delay .
` The square be crowd with people of all age and all rank , and in the middle a platform have be erect on which be the scaffold , with the executioner , in a black mask , stand by .
At a sign from him I mount first , and in a moment my head be roll at his foot .
With a bound my sister and Thelamis be beside me , and like lightning Thelamis seize the sabre from the heads-man , and cut off the head of the prince .
And before the multitude have recover from their astonishment at these strange proceeding , our body be join to our right head , and the pastille place on our tongue .
Then Thelamis lead the prince to the edge of the platform and present him to the people , say `` Behold your lawful king . ''
` Shouts of joy rent the air at the sound of Thelamis 's word , and the noise reach Okimpare in the palace .
Smitten with despair at the news , she fell down unconscious on her balcony , and be lift up by the slave and take back to her own house .
` Meanwhile our happiness be all turn to sorrow .
I have rush up to the prince to embrace him fondly , when he suddenly grow pale and stagger . '
`` I die faithful to you , '' he murmur , turn his eye towards me , `` and I die a king ! ''
and lean his head on my shoulder he expire quietly , for one of the artery in his neck have be cut through .
` Not know what I do I stagger towards the sabre which be lie near me , with the intention of follow my beloved prince as speedily a possible .
And when Thelamis seize my hand -LRB- but only just in time -RRB- , in my madness I turn the sabre upon him , and he fell struck through the heart at my foot . '
* * * * * The whole company be listen to the story with breathless attention , when it become plain that Dely could go no far , while Tezila have fling herself on a heap of cushion and hide her face .
Zambac order her woman to give them all the attention possible , and desire they should be carry into her own room .
When the two sister be in this condition , Ibrahim , who be a very prudent young man , suggest to his parent that a the two Circassians be both unconscious , it would be an excellent opportunity to search them and see if the talisman belong to the daughter of Siroco be conceal about their person .
But the Bassa , shock at the notion of treat his guest in so inhospitable a manner , refuse to do anything of the kind , add that the next day he hop to persuade them to give the talisman up of their own free will .
By this time it be nearly midnight and Neangir , who be stand near the Jewess Sumi , draw out the portrait of Argentine , and heard with delight that she be even more beautiful than her picture .
Every one be wait on tiptoe for the appearance of the two watch , who be expect when the clock strike twelve to come in search of Sumi , and that there might be no delay the Bassa order all the door to be flung wide open .
It be do , and there enter not the longed-for watch , but the page who have be send away in disgrace .
Then the Bassa arose in wrath .
` Azemi , ' he say , ` do I not order you to stand no more in my presence ? '
` My lord , ' reply Azemi , modestly , ' I be hide outside the door , listen to the tale of the two Circassians .
And a I know you be fond of story , give me also leave to tell you one .
I promise you it shall not be long . '
` Speak on , ' reply the Bassa , ` but take heed what you say . '
` My lord , ' begin Azemi , ` this morning I be walk in the town when I notice a man go in the same direction follow by a slave .
He enter a baker 's shop , where he buy some bread which he give to the slave to carry .
I watch him and saw that he purchase many other kind of provision at other place , and when the slave could carry no more his master command him to return home and have supper ready at midnight .
` When left alone the man go up the street , and turn into a jeweller 's shop , bring out a watch that as far a I could see be make of silver .
He walk on a few step , then stoop and pick up a gold watch which lay at his foot .
At this point I run up and tell him that if he do not give me half it price I would report him to the Cadi ; he agree , and conduct me to his house produce four hundred sequin , which he say be my share , and have get what I want I go away .
` As it be the hour for attend on my lord I return home and accompany you to the Cadi , where I hear the story of the three Jews and learn the importance of the two watch I have leave at the stranger 's .
I hasten to his house , but he have go out , and I could only find the slave , whom I tell that I be the bearer of important news for his master .
Believing me to be one of his friend , he beg me to wait , and show me into a room where I saw the two watch lie on the table .
I put them in my pocket , leave the four hundred sequin in place of the gold watch and three gold piece which I know to be the price of the other .
As you know the watch never remain with the person who buy them , this man may think himself very lucky to get back his money .
I have wind them both up , and at this instant Aurora and Argentine be lock safely into my own room . '
Everybody be so delighted to hear this news that Azemi be nearly stifle with their embrace , and Neangir could hardly be prevent from run to break in the door , though he do not even know where the page slept .
But the page beg to have the honour of fetch the lady himself , and soon return lead them by the hand .
For some minute all be a happy confusion , and Ibrahim take advantage of it to fall on his knee before Aurora , and search in the fifth fold of her dress for the missing coral bead .
The Book of Spells have tell the truth ; there it be , and a the chaplet be now complete the young man 's day of seek be over .
In the midst of the general rejoicing Hassan alone bore a gloomy face .
` Alas ! '
he say , ` everyone be happy but the miserable be you see before you .
I have lose the only consolation in my grief , which be to feel that I have a brother in misfortune ! '
` Be comfort , ' reply the Bassa ; ` sooner or later the dervish who steal the pink bag be sure to be find . '
Supper be then serve , and after they have all eaten of rare fruit which seem to them the most delicious in the whole world , the Bassa order the flask contain the elixir of love to be bring and the young people to drink of it .
Then their eye shone with a new fire , and they swear to be true to each other till death .
This ceremony be scarcely over when the clock strike one , and in an instant Aurora and Argentine have vanish , and in the place where they stand lay two watch .
Silence fell upon all the company -- they have forget the enchantment ; then the voice of Azemi be hear ask if he might be allow to take charge of the watch till the next day , pledge his head to end their enchantment .
With the consent of Sumi , this be grant , and the Bassa give Azemi a purse contain a thousand sequins , a a reward for the service he have already render to them .
After this everybody go to his own apartment .
Azemi have never possess so much money before , and never close his eye for joy the whole night long .
Very early he get up and go into the garden , think how he could break the enchantment of the daughter of Siroco .
Suddenly the soft tone of a woman fell on his ear , and peep through the bush he saw Tezila , who be arrange flower in her sister 's hair .
The rustling of the leaf cause Dely to start ; she jump up as if to fly , but Azemi implore her to remain and beg her to tell him what happen to them after the death of their lover , and how they have come to find the dervish .
` The punishment decreed to u by the Queen Okimpare , ' answer Dely , ` be that we be to dance and sing in the midst of our sorrow , at a great fête which be to be hold that very day for all her people .
This cruel command nearly turn our brain , and we swear a solemn oath to make all lover as wretched a we be ourselves .
In this design we succeed so well that in a short time the lady of the capital come in a body to Okimpare , and pray her to banish u from the kingdom , before their life be make miserable for ever .
She consent , and command u to be place on board a ship , with our slave Gouloucou .
` On the shore we saw an old man who be busily engage in drown some little black pig , talk to them all the while , a if they could understand him .
-LSB- Illustration : The Dervish drown the Pigs -RSB- ' `` Accursed race , '' say he , `` it be you who have cause all the misfortune of him to whom I give the magic bracelet .
Perish all of you ! ''
` We draw near from curiosity , and recognise in him the dervish who have shelter u on our first escape from the caravan .
` When the old man discover who we be he be beside himself with pleasure , and offer u a refuge in the cave where he live .
We gladly accept his offer , and to the cave we all go , take with u the last little pig , which he give u a a present . '
`` The Bassa of the Sea , '' he add , `` will pay you anything you like to ask for it . ''
` Without ask why it be so precious I take the pig and place it in my work bag , where it have be ever since .
Only yesterday we offer it to the Bassa , who laugh at u , and this so enraged u against the dervish that we cut off his beard when he be asleep , and now he dare not show himself . '
` Ah , ' exclaim the page , ` it be not fit that such beauty should waste itself in make other people miserable .
Forget the unhappy past and think only of the future .
And accept , I pray you , this watch , to mark the brighter hour in store . '
So say he lay the watch upon her knee .
Then he turn to Tezila .
` And you , fair maiden , permit me to offer you this other watch .
True it be only of silver , but it be all I have leave to give .
And I feel quite sure that you must have somewhere a silver seal , that will be exactly the thing to go with it . '
` Why , so you have , ' cry Dely ; ` fasten your silver seal to your watch , and I will hang my gold one on to mine . '
The seal be produce , and , a Azemi have guess , they be the talisman which the two Circassians have take from Izif and Izouf , mount in gold and silver .
As quick a lightning the watch slide from the hand of Tezila and her sister , and Aurora and Argentine stand before them , each with her talisman on her finger .
At first they seem rather confused themselves at the change which have take place , and the sunlight which they have not see for so long , but when gradually they understand that their enchantment have come to an end , they could find no word to express their happiness .
The Circassians could with difficulty be comfort for the loss of the talisman , but Aurora and Argentine entreat them to dry their tear , a their father , Siroco , who be governor of Alexandria , would not fail to reward them in any manner they wish .
This promise be soon confirm by Siroco himself , who come into the garden with the Bassa and his two son , and be speedily join by the lady of the family .
Only Hassan be absent .
It be the hour in which he be condemn to bewail his ebony hand .
To the surprise of all a noise be at this moment heard in a corner of the terrace , and Hassan himself appear surround by slave , clap his hand and shout with joy . '
I be weep as usual , ' cry he , ` when all at once the tear refuse to come to my eye , and on look down at my hand I saw that it blackness have vanish .
And now , lovely Zelida , nothing prevents me any longer from offer you the hand , when the heart have be yours always . '
But though Hassan never think of ask or care what have cause his cure , the others be by no mean so indifferent .
It be quite clear that the little black pig must be dead -- but how , and when ?
To this the slave answer that they have see that morning a man pursue by three others , and that he have take refuge in the cavern which they have be leave to guard .
Then , in obedience to order , they have roll a stone over the entrance .
Piercing shriek interrupt their story , and a man , whom the Circassians saw to be the old dervish , rush round the corner of the terrace with the three Jews behind him .
When the fugitive beheld so many people collect together , he turn down another path , but the slave capture all four and bring them before their master .
What be the surprise of the Bassa when he behold in the old dervish the man who have give the chaplet , the copper plate , and the bracelet to his three son .
` Fear nothing , holy father , ' he say , ` you be safe with me .
But tell u , how come you here ? '
` My lord , ' explain the dervish , ` when my beard be cut off during my sleep by the two Circassians , I be ashamed to appear before the eye of men , and flee , bear with me the pink silk bag .
In the night these three men fell in with me , and we pass some time in conversation , but at dawn , when it be light enough to see each other 's face , one of them exclaim that I be the dervish travelling with the two Circassians who have steal the talisman from the Jews .
I jump up and try to fly to my cave , but they be too quick for me , and just a we reach your garden they snatch the bag which contain the little black pig and fling it into the sea .
By this act , which deliver your son , I would pray you to forgive them for any wrong they may have do you -- nay more , that you will recompense them for it . '
The Bassa grant the holy man 's request , and see that the two Jews have fall victim to the charm of the Circassian lady , give his consent to their union , which be fix to take place at the same time a that of Izaf with the wise Sumi .
The Cadi be send for , and the Jews exchange the hat of their race for the turban of the follower of the Prophet .
Then , after so many misfortune , the Bassa 's three son entreat their father to delay their happiness no longer , and the six marriage be perform by the Cadi at the hour of noon .

-RSB- THE JACKAL AND THE SPRING Once upon a time all the stream and river run so dry that the animal do not know how to get water .
After a very long search , which have be quite in vain , they find a tiny spring , which only want to be dug deep so a to yield plenty of water .
So the beast say to each other , ` Let u dig a well , and then we shall not fear to die of thirst ; ' and they all consent except the jackal , who hat work of any kind , and generally get somebody to do it for him .
When they have finish their well , they hold a council a to who should be make the guardian of the well , so that the jackal might not come near it , for , they say , ` he would not work , therefore he shall not drink . '
After some talk it be decide that the rabbit should be leave in charge ; then all the other beast go back to their home .
When they be out of sight the jackal arrive .
` Good morning !
Good morning , rabbit ! '
and the rabbit politely say , ` Good morning ! '
Then the jackal unfasten the little bag that hung at his side , and pull out of it a piece of honeycomb which he begin to eat , and turn to the rabbit he remark : ` As you see , rabbit , I be not thirsty in the least , and this be nice than any water . '
` Give me a bit , ' ask the rabbit .
So the jackal hand him a very little morsel .
` Oh , how good it be ! '
cry the rabbit ; ` give me a little more , dear friend ! '
But the jackal answer , ` If you really want me to give you some more , you must have your paw tie behind you , and lie on your back , so that I can pour it into your mouth . '
The rabbit do a he be bid , and when he be tie tight and pop on his back , the jackal run to the spring and drank as much a he want .
When he have quite finish he return to his den .
In the even the animal all come back , and when they saw the rabbit lie with his paw tie , they say to him : ` Rabbit , how do you let yourself be take in like this ? '
` It be all the fault of the jackal , ' reply the rabbit ; ` he tie me up like this , and tell me he would give me something nice to eat .
It be all a trick just to get at our water . '
` Rabbit , you be no good than an idiot to have let the jackal drink our water when he would not help to find it .
Who shall be our next watchman ?
We must have somebody a little sharp than you ! '
and the little hare call out , ' I will be the watchman . '
The following morning the animal all go their various way , leave the little hare to guard the spring .
When they be out of sight the jackal come back .
` Good morning !
good morning , little hare , ' and the little hare politely say , ` Good morning . '
` Can you give me a pinch of snuff ? '
say the jackal . '
I be so sorry , but I have none , ' answer the little hare .
The jackal then come and sit down by the little hare , and unfasten his little bag , pull out of it a piece of honeycomb .
He lick his lip and exclaim , ` Oh , little hare , if you only know how good it be ! '
` What be it ? '
ask the little hare .
` It be something that moisten my throat so deliciously , ' answer the jackal , ` that after I have eat it I do n't feel thirsty any more , while I be sure that all you other beast be for ever want water . '
` Give me a bit , dear friend , ' ask the little hare .
` Not so fast , ' reply the jackal .
` If you really wish to enjoy what you be eat , you must have your paw tie behind you , and lie on your back , so that I can pour it into your mouth . '
` You can tie them , only be quick , ' say the little hare , and when he be tie tight and pop on his back , the jackal go quietly down to the well , and drink as much a he want .
When he have quite finish he return to his den .
In the even the animal all come back ; and when they saw the little hare with his paw tie , they say to him : ` Little hare , how do you let yourself be take in like this ?
Did n't you boast you be very sharp ?
You undertake to guard our water ; now show u how much be leave for u to drink ! '
` It be all the fault of the jackal , ' reply the little hare , ` He tell me he would give me something nice to eat if I would just let him tie my hand behind my back . '
Then the animal say , ` Who can we trust to mount guard now ? '
And the panther answer , ` Let it be the tortoise . '
The following morning the animal all go their various way , leave the tortoise to guard the spring .
When they be out of sight the jackal come back .
` Good morning , tortoise ; good morning . '
But the tortoise take no notice .
` Good morning , tortoise ; good morning . '
But still the tortoise pretend not to hear .
Then the jackal say to himself , ` Well , to-day I have only get to manage a big idiot than before .
I shall just kick him on one side , and then go and have a drink . '
So he go up to the tortoise and say to him in a soft voice , ` Tortoise !
tortoise ! '
but the tortoise take no notice .
Then the jackal kick him out of the way , and go to the well and begin to drink , but scarcely have he touch the water , than the tortoise seize him by the leg .
The jackal shriek out : ` Oh , you will break my leg ! '
but the tortoise only hold on the tighter .
The jackal then take his bag and try to make the tortoise smell the honeycomb he have inside ; but the tortoise turn away his head and smelt nothing .
At last the jackal say to the tortoise , ' I should like to give you my bag and everything in it , ' but the only answer the tortoise make be to grasp the jackal 's leg tighter still .
So matter stand when the other animal come back .
The moment he saw them , the jackal give a violent tug , and manage to free his leg , and then take to his heel a fast a he could .
And the animal all say to the tortoise : ` Well do , tortoise , you have prove your courage ; now we can drink from our well in peace , a you have get the good of that thieve jackal ! '
