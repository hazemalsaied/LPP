All this time the noise in the distance have continue to increase ; the rumble of cart , the clatter of horse , the cry of men , a great , confused rumour , come swell on the wind ; and it be plain that the rout of a whole army be pour , like an inundation , down the road .
Dick stand sombre .
He have mean to follow the highway till the turn for Holywood , and now he have to change his plan .
But above all , he have recognise the colour of Earl Risingham , and he know that the battle have go finally against the rise of Lancaster .
Had Sir Daniel join , and be he now a fugitive and ruin ?
or have he desert to the side of York , and be he forfeit to honour ?
It be an ugly choice .
`` Come , '' he say , sternly ; and , turn on his heel , he begin to walk forward through the grove , with Matcham limp in his rear .
For some time they continue to thread the forest in silence .
It be now grow late ; the sun be set in the plain beyond Kettley ; the tree-tops overhead glow golden ; but the shadow have begin to grow darker and the chill of the night to fall .
`` If there be anything to eat ! ''
cry Dick , suddenly , pause a he speak .
Matcham sit down and begin to weep .
`` Ye can weep for your own supper , but when it be to save men 's life , your heart be hard enough , '' say Dick , contemptuously .
`` Y ' ` ave seven death upon your conscience , Master John ; I 'll ne'er forgive you that . ''
`` Conscience ! ''
cry Matcham , look fiercely up .
`` Mine !
And ye have the man 's red blood upon your dagger !
And wherefore do ye slay him , the poor soul ?
He draw his arrow , but he let not fly ; he hold you in his hand , and spar you !
'T be as brave to kill a kitten , a a man that not defend himself . ''
Dick be strike dumb .
`` I slew him fair .
I run me in upon his bow , '' he cry .
`` It be a coward blow , '' return Matcham .
`` Y ' be but a lout and bully , Master Dick ; ye but abuse advantage ; let there come a strong , we will see you truckle at his boot !
Ye care not for vengeance , neither -- for your father 's death that go unpaid , and his poor ghost that clamoureth for justice .
But if there come but a poor creature in your hand that lacketh skill and strength , and would befriend you , down she shall go ! ''
Dick be too furious to observe that `` she . ''
`` Marry ! ''
he cry , `` and here be news !
Of any two the one will still be strong .
The good man throweth the worse , and the worse be well serve .
Ye deserve a belting , Master Matcham , for your ill-guidance and unthankfulness to meward ; and what ye deserve ye shall have . ''
And Dick , who , even in his angry temper , still preserve the appearance of composure , begin to unbuckle his belt .
`` Here shall be your supper , '' he say , grimly .
Matcham have stop his tear ; he be as white a a sheet , but he look Dick steadily in the face , and never move .
Dick take a step , swing the belt .
Then he pause , embarrass by the large eye and the thin , weary face of his companion .
His courage begin to subside .
`` Say ye be in the wrong , then , '' he say , lamely .
`` Nay , '' say Matcham , `` I be in the right .
Come , cruel !
I be lame ; I be weary ; I resist not ; I ne'er do thee hurt ; come , beat me -- coward ! ''
Dick raise the belt at this last provocation , but Matcham wince and draw himself together with so cruel an apprehension , that his heart fail him yet again .
The strap fell by his side , and he stand irresolute , feel like a fool .
`` A plague upon thee , shrew ! ''
he say .
`` An ye be so feeble of hand , ye should keep the closer guard upon your tongue .
But I 'll be hang before I beat you ! ''
and he put on his belt again .
`` Beat you I will not , '' he continue ; `` but forgive you ?
-- never .
I know ye not ; ye be my master 's enemy ; I lend you my horse ; my dinner ye have eat ; y ' ` ave call me a man o ' wood , a coward , and a bully .
Nay , by the mass !
the measure be fill , and runneth over .
'T be a great thing to be weak , I trow : ye can do your bad , yet shall none punish you ; ye may steal a man 's weapon in the hour of need , yet may the man not take his own again ; -- y ' be weak , forsooth !
Nay , then , if one cometh charge at you with a lance , and crieth he be weak , ye must let him pierce your body through !
Tut !
fool word ! ''
`` And yet ye beat me not , '' return Matcham .
`` Let be , '' say Dick -- `` let be .
I will instruct you .
Y ' ` ave be ill-nurtured , methinks , and yet ye have the making of some good , and , beyond all question , save me from the river .
Nay , I have forget it ; I be as thankless a thyself .
But , come , let u on .
An we be for Holywood this night , ay , or to-morrow early , we have best set forward speedily . ''
But though Dick have talk himself back into his usual good-humour , Matcham have forgive him nothing .
His violence , the recollection of the forester whom he have slay -- above all , the vision of the upraised belt , be thing not easily to be forget .
`` I will thank you , for the form 's sake , '' say Matcham .
`` But , in sooth , good Master Shelton , I have liever find my way alone .
Here be a wide wood ; prithee , let each choose his path ; I owe you a dinner and a lesson .
Fare ye well ! ''
`` Nay , '' cry Dick , `` if that be your tune , so be it , and a plague be with you ! ''
Each turn aside , and they begin walk off severally , with no thought of the direction , intent solely on their quarrel .
But Dick have not go ten pace ere his name be call , and Matcham come run after .
`` Dick , '' he say , `` it be unmannerly to part so coldly .
Here be my hand , and my heart with it .
For all that wherein you have so excellently serve and help me -- not for the form , but from the heart , I thank you .
Fare ye right well . ''
`` Well , lad , '' return Dick , take the hand which be offer him , `` good speed to you , if speed you may .
But I misdoubt it shrewdly .
Y ' be too disputatious . ''
So then they separate for the second time ; and presently it be Dick who be run after Matcham .
`` Here , '' he say , `` take my cross-bow ; shalt not go unarmed . ''
`` A cross-bow ! ''
say Matcham .
`` Nay , boy , I have neither the strength to bend nor yet the skill to aim with it .
It be no help to me , good boy .
But yet I thank you . ''
The night have now fall , and under the tree they could no longer read each other 's face .
`` I will go some little way with you , '' say Dick .
`` The night be dark .
I would fain leave you on a path , at least .
My mind misgiveth me , y ' be likely to be lose . ''
Without any more word , he begin to walk forward , and the other once more follow him .
The blackness grow thicker and thicker .
Only here and there , in open place , they saw the sky , dot with small star .
In the distance , the noise of the rout of the Lancastrian army still continue to be faintly audible ; but with every step they leave it far in the rear .
At the end of half an hour of silent progress they come forth upon a broad patch of heathy open .
It glimmer in the light of the star , shaggy with fern and islanded with clump of yew .
And here they pause and look upon each other .
`` Y ' be weary ? ''
Dick say .
`` Nay , I be so weary , '' answer Matcham , `` that methinks I could lie down and die . ''
`` I hear the chiding of a river , '' return Dick .
`` Let u go so far forth , for I be sore athirst . ''
The ground slop down gently ; and , sure enough , in the bottom , they find a little murmuring river , run among willow .
Here they throw themselves down together by the brink ; and put their mouth to the level of a starry pool , they drink their fill .
`` Dick , '' say Matcham , `` it may not be .
I can no more . ''
`` I saw a pit a we come down , '' say Dick .
`` Let u lie down therein and sleep . ''
`` Nay , but with all my heart ! ''
cry Matcham .
The pit be sandy and dry ; a shock of bramble hang upon one hedge , and make a partial shelter ; and there the two lad lay down , keep close together for the sake of warmth , their quarrel all forgotten .
And soon sleep fell upon them like a cloud , and under the dew and star they rest peacefully .
CHAPTER VII -- THE HOODED FACE They awake in the grey of the morning ; the bird be not yet in full song , but twitter here and there among the wood ; the sun be not yet up , but the eastern sky be bar with solemn colour .
Half starve and over-weary a they be , they lay without move , sunk in a delightful lassitude .
And a they thus lay , the clang of a bell fell suddenly upon their ear .
`` A bell ! ''
say Dick , sit up .
`` Can we be , then , so near to Holywood ? ''
A little after , the bell clang again , but this time somewhat near hand ; and from that time forth , and still draw nearer and nearer , it continue to sound brokenly abroad in the silence of the morning .
`` Nay , what should this betoken ? ''
say Dick , who be now broad awake .
`` It be some one walking , '' return Matcham , and `` the bell tolleth ever a he move . ''
`` I see that well , '' say Dick .
`` But wherefore ?
What maketh he in Tunstall Woods ?
Jack , '' he add , `` laugh at me an ye will , but I like not the hollow sound of it . ''
`` Nay , '' say Matcham , with a shiver , `` it hath a doleful note .
An the day be not come '' -- But just then the bell , quicken it pace , begin to ring thick and hurry , and then it give a single hammering jangle , and be silent for a space .
`` It be a though the bearer have run for a pater-noster while , and then leap the river , '' Dick observe .
`` And now beginneth he again to pace soberly forward , '' add Matcham .
`` Nay , '' return Dick -- `` nay , not so soberly , Jack .
'T be a man that walketh you right speedily .
'T be a man in some fear of his life , or about some hurried business .
See ye not how swift the beating draweth near ? ''
`` It be now close by , '' say Matcham .
They be now on the edge of the pit ; and a the pit itself be on a certain eminence , they command a view over the great proportion of the clearing , up to the thick wood that close it in .
The daylight , which be very clear and grey , show them a riband of white footpath wandering among the gorse .
It pass some hundred yard from the pit , and run the whole length of the clearing , east and west .
By the line of it course , Dick judge it should lead more or less directly to the Moat House .
Upon this path , step forth from the margin of the wood , a white figure now appear .
It pause a little , and seem to look about ; and then , at a slow pace , and bent almost double , it begin to draw near across the heath .
At every step the bell clank .
Face , it have none ; a white hood , not even pierce with eye-holes , veil the head ; and a the creature move , it seem to feel it way with the tapping of a stick .
Fear fell upon the lad , as cold a death .
`` A leper ! ''
say Dick , hoarsely .
`` His touch be death , '' say Matcham .
`` Let u run . ''
`` Not so , '' return Dick .
`` See ye not ?
-- he be stone blind .
He guideth him with a staff .
Let u lie still ; the wind bloweth towards the path , and he will go by and hurt u not .
Alas , poor soul , and we should rather pity him ! ''
`` I will pity him when he be by , '' reply Matcham .
The blind leper be now about halfway towards them , and just then the sun rise and shone full on his veiled face .
He have be a tall man before he be bow by his disgust sickness , and even now he walk with a vigorous step .
The dismal beating of his bell , the pattering of the stick , the eyeless screen before his countenance , and the knowledge that he be not only doom to death and suffering , but shut out for ever from the touch of his fellow-men , fill the lad ' bosom with dismay ; and at every step that bring him nearer , their courage and strength seem to desert them .
As he come about level with the pit , he pause , and turn his face full upon the lad .
`` Mary be my shield !
He see u ! ''
say Matcham , faintly .
`` Hush ! ''
whisper Dick .
`` He doth but hearken .
He be blind , fool ! ''
The leper look or listen , whichever he be really do , for some second .
Then he begin to move on again , but presently pause once more , and again turned and seem to gaze upon the lad .
Even Dick become dead-white and close his eye , a if by the mere sight he might become infected .
But soon the bell sound , and this time , without any farther hesitation , the leper cross the remainder of the little heath and disappear into the covert of the wood .
`` He saw u , '' say Matcham .
`` I could swear it ! ''
`` Tut ! ''
return Dick , recover some spark of courage .
`` He but hear u .
He be in fear , poor soul !
An ye be blind , and walk in a perpetual night , ye would start yourself , if ever a twig rustle or a bird cry ` Peep . ' ''
`` Dick , good Dick , he saw u , '' repeat Matcham .
`` When a man hearkeneth , he doth not a this man ; he doth otherwise , Dick .
This be see ; it be not hear .
He mean foully .
Hark , else , if his bell be not stop ! ''
Such be the case .
The bell ring no longer .
`` Nay , '' say Dick , `` I like not that .
Nay , '' he cry again , `` I like that little .
What may this betoken ?
Let u go , by the mass ! ''
`` He hath go east , '' add Matcham .
`` Good Dick , let u go westward straight ; I shall not breathe till I have my back turn upon that leper . ''
`` Jack , y ' be too cowardly , '' reply Dick .
`` We shall go fair for Holywood , or a fair , at least , a I can guide you , and that will be due north . ''
They be afoot at once , pass the stream upon some stepping-stones , and begin to mount on the other side , which be steep , towards the margin of the wood .
The ground become very uneven , full of knoll and hollow ; tree grow scattered or in clump ; it become difficult to choose a path , and the lad somewhat wander .
They be weary , besides , with yesterday 's exertion and the lack of food , and they move but heavily and drag their foot among the sand .
Presently , come to the top of a knoll , they be aware of the leper , some hundred foot in front of them , cross the line of their march by a hollow .
His bell be silent , his staff no longer tap the ground , and he go before him with the swift and assured footstep of a man who see .
Next moment he have disappear into a little thicket .
The lad , at the first glimpse , have crouch behind a tuft of gorse ; there they lay , horror-struck .
`` Certain , he pursueth u , '' say Dick -- `` certain !
He hold the clapper of his bell in one hand , saw ye ?
that it should not sound .
Now may the saint aid and guide u , for I have no strength to combat pestilence ! ''
`` What maketh he ? ''
cry Matcham .
`` What doth he want ?
Who ever hear the like , that a leper , out of mere malice , should pursue unfortunate ?
Hath he not his bell to that very end , that people may avoid him ?
Dick , there be below this something deeper . ''
`` Nay , I care not , '' moan Dick ; `` the strength be go out of me ; my leg be like water .
The saint be mine assistance ! ''
`` Would ye lie there idle ? ''
cry Matcham .
`` Let u back into the open .
We have the good chance ; he can not steal upon u unawares . ''
`` Not I , '' say Dick .
`` My time be come , and peradventure he may pass u by . ''
`` Bend me , then , your bow ! ''
cry the other .
`` What !
will ye be a man ? ''
Dick cross himself .
`` Would ye have me shoot upon a leper ? ''
he cry .
`` The hand would fail me .
Nay , now , '' he add -- `` nay , now , let be !
With sound men I will fight , but not with ghost and leper .
Which this be , I wot not .
One or other , Heaven be our protection ! ''
`` Now , '' say Matcham , `` if this be man 's courage , what a poor thing be man !
But sith ye will do naught , let u lie close . ''
Then come a single , broken jangle on the bell .
`` He hath miss his hold upon the clapper , '' whisper Matcham .
`` Saints !
how near he be ! ''
But Dick answer never a word ; his teeth be near chatter .
Soon they saw a piece of the white robe between some bush ; then the leper 's head be thrust forth from behind a trunk , and he seem narrowly to scan the neighbourhood before he once again withdrew .
To their stretched sens , the whole bush appear alive with rustling and the creak of twig ; and they hear the beating of each other 's heart .
Suddenly , with a cry , the leper sprang into the open close by , and run straight upon the lad .
They , shriek aloud , separate and begin to run different way .
But their horrible enemy fasten upon Matcham , run him swiftly down , and have him almost instantly a prisoner .
The lad give one scream that echo high and far over the forest , he have one spasm of struggle , and then all his limb relax , and he fell limp into his captor 's arm .
Dick hear the cry and turn .
He saw Matcham fall ; and on the instant his spirit and his strength revive ; With a cry of pity and anger , he unslung and bend his arblast .
But ere he have time to shoot , the leper hold up his hand .
`` Hold your shot , Dickon ! ''
cry a familiar voice .
`` Hold your shot , mad wag !
Know ye not a friend ? ''
And then lay down Matcham on the turf , he undo the hood from off his face , and disclose the feature of Sir Daniel Brackley .
`` Sir Daniel ! ''
cry Dick .
`` Ay , by the mass , Sir Daniel ! ''
return the knight .
`` Would ye shoot upon your guardian , rogue ?
But here be this '' -- And there he break off , and point to Matcham , ask : `` How call ye him , Dick ? ''
`` Nay , '' say Dick , `` I call him Master Matcham .
Know ye him not ?
He say ye know him ! ''
`` Ay , '' reply Sir Daniel , `` I know the lad ; '' and he chuckle .
`` But he have faint ; and , by my sooth , he might have have less to faint for !
Hey , Dick ?
Did I put the fear of death upon you ? ''
`` Indeed , Sir Daniel , ye do that , '' say Dick , and sigh again at the mere recollection .
`` Nay , sir , save your respect , I have a lief ` a ' meet the devil in person ; and to speak truth , I be yet all a-quake .
But what make ye , sir , in such a guise ? ''
Sir Daniel 's brow grow suddenly black with anger .
`` What make I ? ''
he say .
`` Ye do well to mind me of it !
What ?
I skulk for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall , Dick .
We be ill speed at the battle ; we but get there to be sweep among the rout .
Where be all my good man-at-arms ?
Dick , by the mass , I know not !
We be sweep down ; the shot fell thick among u ; I have not see one man in my own colour since I saw three fall .
For myself , I come sound to Shoreby , and be mindful of the Black Arrow , get me this gown and bell , and come softly by the path for the Moat House .
There be no disguise to be compare with it ; the jingle of this bell would scare me the stout outlaw in the forest ; they would all turn pale to hear it .
At length I come by you and Matcham .
I could see but evilly through this same hood , and be not sure of you , be chiefly , and for many a good cause , astonish at the finding you together .
Moreover , in the open , where I have to go slowly and tap with my staff , I fear to disclose myself .
But see , '' he add , `` this poor shrew begin a little to revive .
A little good canary will comfort me the heart of it . ''
The knight , from under his long dress , produce a stout bottle , and begin to rub the temple and wet the lip of the patient , who return gradually to consciousness , and begin to roll dim eye from one to another .
`` What cheer , Jack ! ''
say Dick .
`` It be no leper , after all ; it be Sir Daniel !
See ! ''
`` Swallow me a good draught of this , '' say the knight .
`` This will give you manhood .
Thereafter , I will give you both a meal , and we shall all three on to Tunstall .
For , Dick , '' he continue , lay forth bread and meat upon the grass , `` I will avow to you , in all good conscience , it irk me sorely to be safe between four wall .
Not since I back a horse have I be press so hard ; peril of life , jeopardy of land and livelihood , and to sum up , all these losels in the wood to hunt me down .
But I be not yet shent .
Some of my lad will pick me their way home .
Hatch hath ten fellows ; Selden , he have six .
Nay , we shall soon be strong again ; and if I can but buy my peace with my right fortunate and undeserving Lord of York , why , Dick , we 'll be a man again and go a-horseback ! ''
And so saying , the knight fill himself a horn of canary , and pledge his ward in dumb show .
`` Selden , '' Dick falter -- `` Selden '' -- And he pause again .
Sir Daniel put down the wine untasted .
`` How ! ''
he cry , in a changed voice .
`` Selden ?
Speak !
What of Selden ? ''
Dick stammer forth the tale of the ambush and the massacre .
The knight heard in silence ; but a he listen , his countenance become convulsed with rage and grief .
`` Now here , '' he cry , `` on my right hand , I swear to avenge it !
If that I fail , if that I spill not ten men 's soul for each , may this hand wither from my body !
I break this Duckworth like a rush ; I beggar him to his door ; I burn the thatch above his head ; I drive him from this country ; and now , cometh he back to beard me ?
Nay , but , Duckworth , this time it shall go bitter hard ! ''
He be silent for some time , his face work .
`` Eat ! ''
he cry , suddenly .
`` And you here , '' he add to Matcham , `` swear me an oath to follow straight to the Moat House . ''
`` I will pledge mine honour , '' reply Matcham .
`` What make I with your honour ? ''
cry the knight .
`` Swear me upon your mother 's welfare ! ''
Matcham give the required oath ; and Sir Daniel re-adjusted the hood over his face , and prepare his bell and staff .
To see him once more in that appal travesty somewhat revive the horror of his two companion .
But the knight be soon upon his foot .
`` Eat with despatch , '' he say , `` and follow me yarely to mine house . ''
And with that he set forth again into the wood ; and presently after the bell begin to sound , number his step , and the two lad sit by their untasted meal , and hear it die slowly away up hill into the distance .
`` And so ye go to Tunstall ? ''
Dick inquire .
`` Yea , verily , '' say Matcham , `` when need must !
I be braver behind Sir Daniel 's back than to his face . ''
They eat hastily , and set forth along the path through the airy upper level of the forest , where great beech stand apart among green lawn , and the bird and squirrel make merry on the bough .
Two hour later , they begin to descend upon the other side , and already , among the tree-tops , saw before them the red wall and roof of Tunstall House .
`` Here , '' say Matcham , pausing , `` ye shall take your leave of your friend Jack , whom y ' be to see no more .
Come , Dick , forgive him what he do amiss , a he , for his part , cheerfully and lovingly forgiveth you . ''
`` And wherefore so ? ''
ask Dick .
`` An we both go to Tunstall , I shall see you yet again , I trow , and that right often . ''
`` Ye 'll never again see poor Jack Matcham , '' reply the other , `` that be so fearful and burthensome , and yet pluck you from the river ; ye 'll not see him more , Dick , by mine honour ! ''
He hold his arm open , and the lad embrace and kiss .
`` And , Dick , '' continue Matcham , `` my spirit bodeth ill .
Y ' be now to see a new Sir Daniel ; for heretofore hath all prosper in his hand exceedingly , and fortune follow him ; but now , methinks , when his fate hath come upon him , and he run the adventure of his life , he will prove but a foul lord to both of u .
He may be brave in battle , but he hath the liar 's eye ; there be fear in his eye , Dick , and fear be as cruel a the wolf !
We go down into that house , Saint Mary guide u forth again ! ''
And so they continue their descent in silence , and come out at last before Sir Daniel 's forest stronghold , where it stand , low and shady , flank with round tower and stain with moss and lichen , in the lilied water of the moat .
Even a they appear , the door be open , the bridge lower , and Sir Daniel himself , with Hatch and the parson at his side , stand ready to receive them .
BOOK II -- THE MOAT HOUSE CHAPTER I -- DICK ASKS QUESTIONS The Moat House stand not far from the rough forest road .
Externally , it be a compact rectangle of red stone , flank at each corner by a round tower , pierce for archery and battlemented at the top .
Within , it enclose a narrow court .
The moat be perhaps twelve foot wide , cross by a single drawbridge .
It be supply with water by a trench , lead to a forest pool and command , through it whole length , from the battlement of the two southern tower .
Except that one or two tall and thick tree have be suffer to remain within half a bowshot of the wall , the house be in a good posture for defence .
In the court , Dick find a part of the garrison , busy with preparation for defence , and gloomily discuss the chance of a siege .
Some be make arrow , some sharpening sword that have long be disused ; but even a they work , they shake their head .
Twelve of Sir Daniel 's party have escape the battle , run the gauntlet through the wood , and come alive to the Moat House .
But out of this dozen , three have be gravely wound : two at Risingham in the disorder of the rout , one by John Amend-All 's marksman a he cross the forest .
This raise the force of the garrison , count Hatch , Sir Daniel , and young Shelton , to twenty-two effective men .
And more might be continually expect to arrive .
The danger lay not therefore in the lack of men .
It be the terror of the Black Arrow that oppress the spirit of the garrison .
For their open foe of the party of York , in these most changing time , they felt but a far-away concern .
`` The world , '' a people say in those day , `` might change again '' before harm come .
But for their neighbour in the wood , they tremble .
It be not Sir Daniel alone who be a mark for hatred .
His men , conscious of impunity , have carry themselves cruelly through all the country .
Harsh command have be harshly execute ; and of the little band that now sit talk in the court , there be not one but have be guilty of some act of oppression or barbarity .
And now , by the fortune of war , Sir Daniel have become powerless to protect his instrument ; now , by the issue of some hour of battle , at which many of them have not be present , they have all become punishable traitor to the State , outside the buckler of the law , a shrunken company in a poor fortress that be hardly tenable , and expose upon all side to the just resentment of their victim .
Nor have there be lack grisly advertisement of what they might expect .
At different period of the evening and the night , no few than seven riderless horse have come neighing in terror to the gate .
Two be from Selden 's troop ; five belong to men who have ride with Sir Daniel to the field .
Lastly , a little before dawn , a spearman have come stagger to the moat side , pierce by three arrow ; even a they carry him in , his spirit have depart ; but by the word that he utter in his agony , he must have be the last survivor of a considerable company of men .
Hatch himself show , under his sun-brown , the pallour of anxiety ; and when he have take Dick aside and learn the fate of Selden , he fell on a stone bench and fairly wept .
The others , from where they sit on stool or doorstep in the sunny angle of the court , look at him with wonder and alarm , but none venture to inquire the cause of his emotion .
`` Nay , Master Shelton , '' say Hatch , at last -- `` nay , but what say I ?
We shall all go .
Selden be a man of his hand ; he be like a brother to me .
Well , he have go second ; well , we shall all follow !
For what say their knave rhyme ?
-- ' A black arrow in each black heart . '
Was it not so it go ?
Appleyard , Selden , Smith , old Humphrey go ; and there lieth poor John Carter , cry , poor sinner , for the priest . ''
Dick give ear .
Out of a low window , hard by where they be talk , groan and murmur come to his ear .
`` Lieth he there ? ''
he ask .
`` Ay , in the second porter 's chamber , '' answer Hatch .
`` We could not bear him far , soul and body be so bitterly at odds .
At every step we lift him , he think to wend .
But now , methinks , it be the soul that suffereth .
Ever for the priest he crieth , and Sir Oliver , I wot not why , still cometh not .
` Twill be a long shrift ; but poor Appleyard and poor Selden , they have none . ''
Dick stoop to the window and look in .
The little cell be low and dark , but he could make out the wounded soldier lie moan on his pallet .
`` Carter , poor friend , how goeth it ? ''
he ask .
`` Master Shelton , '' return the man , in an excited whisper , `` for the dear light of heaven , bring the priest .
Alack , I be speed ; I be brought very low down ; my hurt be to the death .
Ye may do me no more service ; this shall be the last .
Now , for my poor soul 's interest , and a a loyal gentleman , bestir you ; for I have that matter on my conscience that shall drag me deep . ''
He groan , and Dick hear the grating of his teeth , whether in pain or terror .
Just then Sir Daniel appear upon the threshold of the hall .
He have a letter in one hand .
`` Lads , '' he say , `` we have have a shog , we have have a tumble ; wherefore , then , deny it ?
Rather it imputeth to get speedily again to saddle .
This old Harry the Sixt have have the undermost .
Wash we , then , our hand of him .
I have a good friend that rideth next the duke , the Lord of Wensleydale .
Well , I have writ a letter to my friend , pray his good lordship , and offer large satisfaction for the past and reasonable surety for the future .
Doubt not but he will lend a favourable ear .
A prayer without gift be like a song without music : I surfeit him with promise , boy -- I spare not to promise .
What , then , be lack ?
Nay , a great thing -- wherefore should I deceive you ?
-- a great thing and a difficult : a messenger to bear it .
The wood -- y ' be not ignorant of that -- lie thick with our ill-willers .
Haste be most needful ; but without sleight and caution all be naught .
Which , then , of this company will take me this letter , bear me it to my Lord of Wensleydale , and bring me the answer back ? ''
One man instantly arise .
`` I will , a n't like you , '' say he .
`` I will even risk my carcase . ''
`` Nay , Dicky Bowyer , not so , '' return the knight .
`` It like me not .
Y ' be sly indeed , but not speedy .
Ye be a laggard ever . ''
`` A n't be so , Sir Daniel , here be I , '' cry another .
`` The saint forfend ! ''
say the knight .
`` Y ' be speedy , but not sly .
Ye would blunder me headforemost into John Amend-All 's camp .
I thank you both for your good courage ; but , in sooth , it may not be . ''
Then Hatch offer himself , and he also be refuse .
`` I want you here , good Bennet ; y ' be my right hand , indeed , '' return the knight ; and then several come forward in a group , Sir Daniel at length select one and give him the letter .
`` Now , '' he say , `` upon your good speed and good discretion we do all depend .
Bring me a good answer back , and before three week , I will have purge my forest of these vagabond that brave u to our face .
But mark it well , Throgmorton : the matter be not easy .
Ye must steal forth under night , and go like a fox ; and how ye be to cross Till I know not , neither by the bridge nor ferry . ''
`` I can swim , '' return Throgmorton .
`` I will come soundly , fear not . ''
`` Well , friend , get ye to the buttery , '' reply Sir Daniel .
`` Ye shall swim first of all in nut-brown ale . ''
And with that he turn back into the hall .
`` Sir Daniel hath a wise tongue , '' say Hatch , aside , to Dick .
`` See , now , where many a less man have gloss the matter over , he speaketh it out plainly to his company .
Here be a danger , ' a saith , and here difficulty ; and jesteth in the very say .
Nay , by Saint Barbary , he be a born captain !
Not a man but he be some deal hearten up !
See how they fall again to work . ''
This praise of Sir Daniel put a thought in the lad 's head .
`` Bennet , '' he say , `` how come my father by his end ? ''
`` Ask me not that , '' reply Hatch .
`` I have no hand nor knowledge in it ; furthermore , I will even be silent , Master Dick .
For look you , in a man 's own business there he may speak ; but of hearsay matter and of common talk , not so .
Ask me Sir Oliver -- ay , or Carter , if ye will ; not me . ''
And Hatch set off to make the round , leave Dick in a muse .
`` Wherefore would he not tell me ? ''
think the lad .
`` And wherefore name he Carter ?
Carter -- nay , then Carter have a hand in it , perchance . ''
He enter the house , and pass some little way along a flagged and vaulted passage , come to the door of the cell where the hurt man lay groan .
At his entrance Carter start eagerly .
`` Have ye bring the priest ? ''
he cry .
`` Not yet awhile , '' return Dick .
`` Y ' ` ave a word to tell me first .
How come my father , Harry Shelton , by his death ? ''
The man 's face alter instantly .
`` I know not , '' he reply , doggedly .
`` Nay , ye know well , '' return Dick .
`` Seek not to put me by . ''
`` I tell you I know not , '' repeat Carter .
`` Then , '' say Dick , `` ye shall die unshriven .
Here be I , and here shall stay .
There shall no priest come near you , rest assure .
For of what avail be penitence , an ye have no mind to right those wrong ye have a hand in ?
and without penitence , confession be but mockery . ''
`` Ye say what ye mean not , Master Dick , '' say Carter , composedly .
`` It be ill threaten the dying , and becometh you -LRB- to speak truth -RRB- little .
And for as little a it commend you , it shall serve you less .
Stay , an ye please .
Ye will condemn my soul -- ye shall learn nothing !
There be my last word to you . ''
And the wounded man turn upon the other side .
Now , Dick , to say truth , have speak hastily , and be ashamed of his threat .
But he make one more effort .
`` Carter , '' he say , `` mistake me not .
I know ye be but an instrument in the hand of others ; a churl must obey his lord ; I would not bear heavily on such an one .
But I begin to learn upon many side that this great duty lieth on my youth and ignorance , to avenge my father .
Prithee , then , good Carter , set aside the memory of my threatenings , and in pure goodwill and honest penitence give me a word of help . ''
The wounded man lay silent ; nor , say what Dick please , could he extract another word from him .
`` Well , '' say Dick , `` I will go call the priest to you a ye desire ; for howsoever ye be in fault to me or mine , I would not be willingly in fault to any , least of all to one upon the last change . ''
Again the old soldier heard him without speech or motion ; even his groan he have suppress ; and a Dick turn and leave the room , he be fill with admiration for that rugged fortitude .
`` And yet , '' he think , `` of what use be courage without wit ?
Had his hand be clean , he would have speak ; his silence do confess the secret louder than word .
Nay , upon all side , proof floweth on me .
Sir Daniel , he or his men , hath do this thing . ''
Dick pause in the stone passage with a heavy heart .
At that hour , in the ebb of Sir Daniel 's fortune , when he be beleaguer by the archer of the Black Arrow and proscribe by the victorious Yorkists , be Dick , also , to turn upon the man who have nourish and teach him , who have severely punish , indeed , but yet unwearyingly protect his youth ?
The necessity , if it should prove to be one , be cruel .
`` Pray Heaven he be innocent ! ''
he say .
And then step sound on the flagging , and Sir Oliver come gravely towards the lad .
`` One seeketh you earnestly , '' say Dick .
`` I be upon the way , good Richard , '' say the priest .
`` It be this poor Carter .
Alack , he be beyond cure . ''
`` And yet his soul be sick than his body , '' answer Dick .
`` Have ye see him ? ''
ask Sir Oliver , with a manifest start .
`` I do but come from him , '' reply Dick .
`` What say he ?
what say he ? ''
snap the priest , with extraordinary eagerness .
`` He but cry for you the more piteously , Sir Oliver .
It be well do to go the faster , for his hurt be grievous , '' return the lad .
`` I be straight for him , '' be the reply .
`` Well , we have all our sin .
We must all come to our latter day , good Richard . ''
`` Ay , sir ; and it be well if we all come fairly , '' answer Dick .
The priest drop his eye , and with an inaudible benediction hurry on .
`` He , too ! ''
think Dick -- `` he , that teach me in piety !
Nay , then , what a world be this , if all that care for me be blood-guilty of my father 's death ?
Vengeance !
Alas !
what a sore fate be mine , if I must be avenge upon my friend ! ''
The thought put Matcham in his head .
He smile at the remembrance of his strange companion , and then wonder where he be .
Ever since they have come together to the door of the Moat House the young lad have disappear , and Dick begin to weary for a word with him .
About an hour after , mass be somewhat hastily run through by Sir Oliver , the company gather in the hall for dinner .
It be a long , low apartment , strewn with green rush , and the wall hang with arras in a design of savage men and quest bloodhound ; here and there hung spear and bow and buckler ; a fire blaze in the big chimney ; there be arras-covered bench round the wall , and in the midst the table , fairly spread , await the arrival of the diner .
Neither Sir Daniel nor his lady make their appearance .
Sir Oliver himself be absent , and here again there be no word of Matcham .
Dick begin to grow alarmed , to recall his companion 's melancholy foreboding , and to wonder to himself if any foul play have befall him in that house .
After dinner he find Goody Hatch , who be hurry to my Lady Brackley .
`` Goody , '' he say , `` where be Master Matcham , I prithee ?
I saw ye go in with him when we arrive . ''
The old woman laugh aloud .
`` Ah , Master Dick , '' she say , `` y ' have a famous bright eye in your head , to be sure ! ''
and laugh again .
`` Nay , but where be he , indeed ? ''
persist Dick .
`` Ye will never see him more , '' she return -- `` never .
It be sure . ''
`` An I do not , '' return the lad , `` I will know the reason why .
He come not hither of his full free will ; such a I be , I be his best protector , and I will see him justly use .
There be too many mystery ; I do begin to weary of the game ! ''
But a Dick be speak , a heavy hand fell on his shoulder .
It be Bennet Hatch that have come unperceived behind him .
With a jerk of his thumb , the retainer dismiss his wife .
`` Friend Dick , '' he say , as soon a they be alone , `` be ye a moon-struck natural ?
An ye leave not certain thing in peace , ye be well in the salt sea than here in Tunstall Moat House .
Y ' have question me ; y ' have bait Carter ; y ' have fright the Jack-priest with hint .
Bear ye more wisely , fool ; and even now , when Sir Daniel calleth you , show me a smooth face for the love of wisdom .
Y ' be to be sharply question .
Look to your answer . ''
`` Hatch , '' return Dick , `` in all this I smell a guilty conscience . ''
`` An ye go not the wiser , ye will soon smell blood , '' reply Bennet .
`` I do but warn you .
And here cometh one to call you . ''
And indeed , at that very moment , a messenger come across the court to summon Dick into the presence of Sir Daniel .
CHAPTER II -- THE TWO OATHS Sir Daniel be in the hall ; there he pace angrily before the fire , await Dick 's arrival .
None be by except Sir Oliver , and he sit discreetly backward , thumb and mutter over his breviary .
`` Y ' have send for me , Sir Daniel ? ''
say young Shelton .
`` I have send for you , indeed , '' reply the knight .
`` For what cometh to mine ear ?
Have I be to you so heavy a guardian that ye make haste to credit ill of me ?
Or sith that ye see me , for the nonce , some worst , do ye think to quit my party ?
By the mass , your father be not so !
Those he be near , those he stand by , come wind or weather .
But you , Dick , y ' be a fair-day friend , it seemeth , and now seek to clear yourself of your allegiance . ''
`` A n't please you , Sir Daniel , not so , '' return Dick , firmly .
`` I be grateful and faithful , where gratitude and faith be due .
And before more be say , I thank you , and I thank Sir Oliver ; y ' have great claim upon me both -- none can have more ; I be a hound if I forget them . ''
`` It be well , '' say Sir Daniel ; and then , rise into anger : `` Gratitude and faith be word , Dick Shelton , '' he continue ; `` but I look to deed .
In this hour of my peril , when my name be attaint , when my land be forfeit , when this wood be full of men that hunger and thirst for my destruction , what doth gratitude ?
what doth faith ?
I have but a little company remain ; be it grateful or faithful to poison me their heart with your insidious whispering ?
Save me from such gratitude !
But , come , now , what be it ye wish ?
Speak ; we be here to answer .
If ye have aught against me , stand forth and say it . ''
`` Sir , '' reply Dick , `` my father fell when I be yet a child .
It hath come to mine ear that he be foully do by .
It hath come to mine ear -- for I will not dissemble -- that ye have a hand in his undoing .
And in all verity , I shall not be at peace in mine own mind , nor very clear to help you , till I have certain resolution of these doubt . ''
Sir Daniel sit down in a deep settle .
He take his chin in his hand and look at Dick fixedly .
`` And ye think I would be guardian to the man 's son that I have murder ? ''
he ask .
`` Nay , '' say Dick , `` pardon me if I answer churlishly ; but indeed ye know right well a wardship be most profitable .
All these year have ye not enjoy my revenue , and lead my men ?
Have ye not still my marriage ?
I wot not what it may be worth -- it be worth something .
Pardon me again ; but if ye be base enough to slay a man under trust , here be , perhaps , reason enough to move you to the less baseness . ''
`` When I be lad of your year , '' return Sir Daniel , sternly , `` my mind have not so turned upon suspicion .
And Sir Oliver here , '' he add , `` why should he , a priest , be guilty of this act ? ''
`` Nay , Sir Daniel , '' say Dick , `` but where the master biddeth there will the dog go .
It be well know this priest be but your instrument .
I speak very freely ; the time be not for courtesy .
Even a I speak , so would I be answer .
And answer get I none !
Ye but put more question .
I rede ye be ware , Sir Daniel ; for in this way ye will but nourish and not satisfy my doubt . ''
`` I will answer you fairly , Master Richard , '' say the knight .
`` Were I to pretend ye have not stir my wrath , I be no honest man .
But I will be just even in anger .
Come to me with these word when y ' be grow and come to man 's estate , and I be no longer your guardian , and so helpless to resent them .
Come to me then , and I will answer you a ye merit , with a buffet in the mouth .
Till then ye have two course : either swallow me down these insult , keep a silent tongue , and fight in the meanwhile for the man that feed and fight for your infancy ; or else -- the door standeth open , the wood be full of mine enemy -- go . ''
The spirit with which these word be uttered , the look with which they be accompany , stagger Dick ; and yet he could not but observe that he have get no answer .
`` I desire nothing more earnestly , Sir Daniel , than to believe you , '' he reply .
`` Assure me ye be free from this . ''
`` Will ye take my word of honour , Dick ? ''
inquire the knight .
`` That would I , '' answer the lad .
`` I give it you , '' return Sir Daniel .
`` Upon my word of honour , upon the eternal welfare of my spirit , and a I shall answer for my deed hereafter , I have no hand nor portion in your father 's death . ''
He extend his hand , and Dick take it eagerly .
Neither of them observe the priest , who , at the pronunciation of that solemn and false oath , have half arise from his seat in an agony of horror and remorse .
`` Ah , '' cry Dick , `` ye must find it in your great-heartedness to pardon me !
I be a churl , indeed , to doubt of you .
But ye have my hand upon it ; I will doubt no more . ''
`` Nay , Dick , '' reply Sir Daniel , `` y ' be forgive .
Ye know not the world and it calumnious nature . ''
`` I be the more to blame , '' add Dick , `` in that the rogue point , not directly at yourself , but at Sir Oliver . ''
As he speak , he turn towards the priest , and pause in the middle of the last word .
This tall , ruddy , corpulent , high-stepping man have fall , you might say , to piece ; his colour be go , his limb be relax , his lip stammer prayer ; and now , when Dick 's eye be fix upon him suddenly , he cry out aloud , like some wild animal , and bury his face in his hand .
Sir Daniel be by him in two stride , and shake him fiercely by the shoulder .
At the same moment Dick 's suspicion reawaken .
`` Nay , '' he say , `` Sir Oliver may swear also .
'T be him they accuse . ''
`` He shall swear , '' say the knight .
Sir Oliver speechlessly wave his arm .
`` Ay , by the mass !
but ye shall swear , '' cry Sir Daniel , beside himself with fury .
`` Here , upon this book , ye shall swear , '' he continue , pick up the breviary , which have fall to the ground .
`` What !
Ye make me doubt you !
Swear , I say ; swear ! ''
But the priest be still incapable of speech .
His terror of Sir Daniel , his terror of perjury , rise to about an equal height , strangle him .
And just then , through the high , stained-glass window of the hall , a black arrow crash , and strike , and stick quivering , in the midst of the long table .
Sir Oliver , with a loud scream , fell faint on the rush ; while the knight , follow by Dick , dash into the court and up the near corkscrew stair to the battlement .
The sentry be all on the alert .
The sun shone quietly on green lawn dot with tree , and on the wooded hill of the forest which enclose the view .
There be no sign of a besieger .
`` Whence come that shot ? ''
ask the knight .
`` From yonder clump , Sir Daniel , '' return a sentinel .
The knight stand a little , muse .
Then he turn to Dick .
`` Dick , '' he say , `` keep me an eye upon these men ; I leave you in charge here .
As for the priest , he shall clear himself , or I will know the reason why .
I do almost begin to share in your suspicion .
He shall swear , trust me , or we shall prove him guilty . ''
Dick answer somewhat coldly , and the knight , give him a piercing glance , hurriedly return to the hall .
His first glance be for the arrow .
It be the first of these missile he have see , and a he turn it to and fro , the dark hue of it touch him with some fear .
Again there be some writing : one word -- `` Earthed . ''
`` Ay , '' he break out , `` they know I be home , then .
Earthed !
Ay , but there be not a dog among them fit to dig me out . ''
Sir Oliver have come to himself , and now scramble to his foot .
`` Alack , Sir Daniel ! ''
he moan , `` y ' ` ave swear a dread oath ; y ' be doom to the end of time . ''
`` Ay , '' return the knight , `` I have swear an oath , indeed , thou chucklehead ; but thyself shalt swear a great .
It shall be on the bless cross of Holywood .
Look to it ; get the word ready .
It shall be swear to-night . ''
`` Now , may Heaven lighten you ! ''
reply the priest ; `` may Heaven incline your heart from this iniquity ! ''
`` Look you , my good father , '' say Sir Daniel , `` if y ' be for piety , I say no more ; ye begin late , that be all .
But if y ' be in any sense bent upon wisdom , hear me .
This lad beginneth to irk me like a wasp .
I have a need for him , for I would sell his marriage .
But I tell you , in all plainness , if that he continue to weary me , he shall go join his father .
I give order now to change him to the chamber above the chapel .
If that ye can swear your innocency with a good , solid oath and an assured countenance , it be well ; the lad will be at peace a little , and I will spare him .
If that ye stammer or blench , or anyways boggle at the swearing , he will not believe you ; and by the mass , he shall die .
There be for your thinking on . ''
`` The chamber above the chapel ! ''
gasp the priest .
`` That same , '' reply the knight .
`` So if ye desire to save him , save him ; and if ye desire not , prithee , go to , and let me be at peace !
For an I have be a hasty man , I would already have put my sword through you , for your intolerable cowardice and folly .
Have ye choose ?
Say ! ''
`` I have choose , '' say the priest .
`` Heaven pardon me , I will do evil for good .
I will swear for the lad 's sake . ''
`` So be it best ! ''
say Sir Daniel .
`` Send for him , then , speedily .
Ye shall see him alone .
Yet I shall have an eye on you .
I shall be here in the panel room . ''
The knight raise the arras and let it fall again behind him .
There be the sound of a spring opening ; then follow the creaking of trod stair .
Sir Oliver , leave alone , cast a timorous glance upward at the arras-covered wall , and cross himself with every appearance of terror and contrition .
`` Nay , if he be in the chapel room , '' the priest murmur , `` be it at my soul 's cost , I must save him . ''
Three minute later , Dick , who have be summon by another messenger , find Sir Oliver standing by the hall table , resolute and pale .
`` Richard Shelton , '' he say , `` ye have require an oath from me .
I might complain , I might deny you ; but my heart be move toward you for the past , and I will even content you a ye choose .
By the true cross of Holywood , I do not slay your father . ''
`` Sir Oliver , '' return Dick , `` when first we read John Amend-All 's paper , I be convince of so much .
But suffer me to put two question .
Ye do not slay him ; grant .
But have ye no hand in it ? ''
`` None , '' say Sir Oliver .
And at the same time he begin to contort his face , and signal with his mouth and eyebrow , like one who desire to convey a warning , yet dare not utter a sound .
Dick regard him in wonder ; then he turn and look all about him at the empty hall .
`` What make ye ? ''
he inquire .
`` Why , naught , '' return the priest , hastily smooth his countenance .
`` I make naught ; I do but suffer ; I be sick .
I -- I -- prithee , Dick , I must begone .
On the true cross of Holywood , I be clean innocent alike of violence or treachery .
Content ye , good lad .
Farewell ! ''
And he make his escape from the apartment with unusual alacrity .
Dick remain root to the spot , his eye wander about the room , his face a changing picture of various emotion , wonder , doubt , suspicion , and amusement .
Gradually , a his mind grow clear , suspicion take the upper hand , and be succeed by certainty of the bad .
He raise his head , and , a he do so , violently start .
High upon the wall there be the figure of a savage hunter weave in the tapestry .
With one hand he hold a horn to his mouth ; in the other he brandish a stout spear .
His face be dark , for he be mean to represent an African .
Now , here be what have startle Richard Shelton .
The sun have move away from the hall windows , and at the same time the fire have blaze up high on the wide hearth , and shed a changeful glow upon the roof and hanging .
In this light the figure of the black hunter have wink at him with a white eyelid .
He continue star at the eye .
The light shone upon it like a gem ; it be liquid , it be alive .
Again the white eyelid close upon it for a fraction of a second , and the next moment it be go .
There could be no mistake .
The live eye that have be watch him through a hole in the tapestry be go .
The firelight no longer shine on a reflect surface .
And instantly Dick awake to the terror of his position .
Hatch 's warning , the mute signal of the priest , this eye that have observe him from the wall , run together in his mind .
He saw he have be put upon his trial , that he have once more betray his suspicion , and that , short of some miracle , he be lose .
`` If I can not get me forth out of this house , '' he think , `` I be a dead man !
And this poor Matcham , too -- to what a cockatrice 's nest have I not lead him ! ''
He be still so thinking , when there come one in haste , to bid him help in change his arm , his clothing , and his two or three book , to a new chamber .
`` A new chamber ? ''
he repeat .
`` Wherefore so ?
What chamber ? '' ''
'T be one above the chapel , '' answer the messenger .
`` It hath stood long empty , '' say Dick , musing .
`` What manner of room be it ? ''
`` Nay , a brave room , '' return the man .
`` But yet '' -- lower his voice -- `` they call it haunt . ''
`` Haunted ? ''
repeat Dick , with a chill .
`` I have not hear of it .
Nay , then , and by whom ? ''
The messenger look about him ; and then , in a low whisper , `` By the sacrist of St. John 's , '' he say .
`` They have him there to sleep one night , and in the morning -- whew !
-- he be go .
The devil have take him , they say ; the more betoken , he have drink late the night before . ''
Dick follow the man with black foreboding .
CHAPTER III -- THE ROOM OVER THE CHAPEL From the battlement nothing far be observe .
The sun journey westward , and at last go down ; but , to the eye of all these eager sentinel , no live thing appear in the neighbourhood of Tunstall House .
When the night be at length fairly come , Throgmorton be lead to a room overlook an angle of the moat .
Thence he be lower with every precaution ; the ripple of his swimming be audible for a brief period ; then a black figure be observe to land by the branch of a willow and crawl away among the grass .
For some half hour Sir Daniel and Hatch stand eagerly give ear ; but all remain quiet .
The messenger have get away in safety .
Sir Daniel 's brow grow clear .
He turn to Hatch .
`` Bennet , '' he say , `` this John Amend-All be no more than a man , ye see .
He sleepeth .
We will make a good end of him , go to ! ''
All the afternoon and evening , Dick have be order hither and thither , one command follow another , till he be bewilder with the number and the hurry of commission .
All that time he have see no more of Sir Oliver , and nothing of Matcham ; and yet both the priest and the young lad run continually in his mind .
It be now his chief purpose to escape from Tunstall Moat House a speedily a might be ; and yet , before he go , he desire a word with both of these .
At length , with a lamp in one hand , he mount to his new apartment .
It be large , low , and somewhat dark .
The window look upon the moat , and although it be so high up , it be heavily bar .
The bed be luxurious , with one pillow of down and one of lavender , and a red coverlet work in a pattern of rose .
All about the wall be cupboard , lock and padlock , and conceal from view by hanging of dark-coloured arras .
Dick make the round , lift the arras , sound the panel , seek vainly to open the cupboard .
He assure himself that the door be strong and the bolt solid ; then he set down his lamp upon a bracket , and once more look all around .
For what reason have he be give this chamber ?
It be large and fine than his own .
Could it conceal a snare ?
Was there a secret entrance ?
Was it , indeed , haunt ?
His blood run a little chilly in his vein .
Immediately over him the heavy foot of a sentry tread the lead .
Below him , he know , be the arched roof of the chapel ; and next to the chapel be the hall .
Certainly there be a secret passage in the hall ; the eye that have watch him from the arras give him proof of that .
Was it not more than probable that the passage extend to the chapel , and , if so , that it have an opening in his room ?
To sleep in such a place , he felt , would be foolhardy .
He make his weapon ready , and take his position in a corner of the room behind the door .
If ill be intend , he would sell his life dear .
The sound of many foot , the challenge , and the password , sound overhead along the battlement ; the watch be be change .
And just then there come a scratching at the door of the chamber ; it grow a little louder ; then a whisper : `` Dick , Dick , it be I ! ''
Dick run to the door , draw the bolt , and admit Matcham .
He be very pale , and carry a lamp in one hand and a drawn dagger in the other .
`` Shut me the door , '' he whisper .
`` Swift , Dick !
This house be full of spy ; I hear their foot follow me in the corridor ; I hear them breathe behind the arras . ''
`` Well , content you , '' return Dick , `` it be close .
We be safe for this while , if there be safety anywhere within these wall .
But my heart be glad to see you .
By the mass , lad , I think ye be speed !
Where hid ye ? ''
`` It matter not , '' return Matcham .
`` Since we be meet , it matter not .
But , Dick , be your eye open ?
Have they tell you of to-morrow 's doings ? ''
`` Not they , '' reply Dick .
`` What make they to-morrow ? ''
`` To-morrow , or to-night , I know not , '' say the other , `` but one time or other , Dick , they do intend upon your life .
I have the proof of it ; I have hear them whisper ; nay , they as good a told me . ''
`` Ay , '' return Dick , `` be it so ?
I have think as much . ''
And he tell him the day 's occurrence at length .
When it be do , Matcham arise and begin , in turn , to examine the apartment .
`` No , '' he say , `` there be no entrance visible .
Yet 't be a pure certainty there be one .
Dick , I will stay by you .
An y ' be to die , I will die with you .
And I can help -- look !
I have steal a dagger -- I will do my best !
And meanwhile , an ye know of any issue , any sally-port we could get open , or any window that we might descend by , I will most joyfully face any jeopardy to flee with you . ''
`` Jack , '' say Dick , `` by the mass , Jack , y ' be the best soul , and the truest , and the brave in all England !
Give me your hand , Jack . ''
And he grasp the other 's hand in silence .
`` I will tell you , '' he resume .
`` There be a window , out of which the messenger descend ; the rope should still be in the chamber .
'T be a hope . ''
`` Hist ! ''
say Matcham .
Both give ear .
There be a sound below the floor ; then it pause , and then begin again .
`` Some one walketh in the room below , '' whisper Matcham .
`` Nay , '' return Dick , `` there be no room below ; we be above the chapel .
It be my murderer in the secret passage .
Well , let him come ; it shall go hard with him ; '' and he grind his teeth .
`` Blow me the light out , '' say the other .
`` Perchance he will betray himself . ''
They blow out both the lamp and lay still a death .
The footfall underneath be very soft , but they be clearly audible .
Several time they come and go ; and then there be a loud jar of a key turning in a lock , follow by a considerable silence .
Presently the step begin again , and then , all of a sudden , a chink of light appear in the planking of the room in a far corner .
It widen ; a trap-door be be open , let in a gush of light .
They could see the strong hand push it up ; and Dick raise his cross-bow , wait for the head to follow .
But now there come an interruption .
From a distant corner of the Moat House shout begin to be hear , and first one voice , and then several , cry aloud upon a name .
This noise have plainly disconcert the murderer , for the trap-door be silently lower to it place , and the step hurriedly return , pass once more close below the lad , and die away in the distance .
Here be a moment 's respite .
Dick breathe deep , and then , and not till then , he give ear to the disturbance which have interrupt the attack , and which be now rather increase than diminish .
All about the Moat House foot be run , door be open and slamming , and still the voice of Sir Daniel tower above all this bustle , shout for `` Joanna . ''
`` Joanna ! ''
repeat Dick .
`` Why , who the murrain should this be ?
Here be no Joanna , nor ever hath be .
What meaneth it ? ''
Matcham be silent .
He seem to have draw far away .
But only a little faint starlight enter by the window , and at the far end of the apartment , where the pair be , the darkness be complete .
`` Jack , '' say Dick , `` I wot not where ye be all day .
Saw ye this Joanna ? ''
`` Nay , '' return Matcham , `` I saw her not . ''
`` Nor heard tell of her ? ''
he pursue .
The step draw nearer .
Sir Daniel be still roar the name of Joanna from the courtyard .
`` Did ye hear of her ? ''
repeat Dick .
`` I hear of her , '' say Matcham .
`` How your voice twitter !
What aileth you ? ''
say Dick . ''
'T be a most excellent good fortune , this Joanna ; it will take their mind from u . ''
`` Dick , '' cry Matcham , `` I be lose ; we be both lose .
Let u flee if there be yet time .
They will not rest till they have find me .
Or , see !
let me go forth ; when they have find me , ye may flee .
Let me forth , Dick -- good Dick , let me away ! ''
She be grope for the bolt , when Dick at last comprehended .
`` By the mass ! ''
he cry , `` y ' be no Jack ; y ' be Joanna Sedley ; y ' be the maid that would not marry me ! ''
The girl pause , and stand silent and motionless .
Dick , too , be silent for a little ; then he speak again .
`` Joanna , '' he say , `` y ' ` ave save my life , and I have save yours ; and we have see blood flow , and be friend and enemy -- ay , and I take my belt to thrash you ; and all that time I think ye be a boy .
But now death have me , and my time 's out , and before I die I must say this : Y ' be the best maid and the brave under heaven , and , if only I could live , I would marry you blithely ; and , live or die , I love you . ''
She answer nothing .
`` Come , '' he say , `` speak up , Jack .
Come , be a good maid , and say ye love me ! ''
`` Why , Dick , '' she cry , `` would I be here ? ''
`` Well , see ye here , '' continue Dick , `` an we but escape whole we 'll marry ; and an we 're to die , we die , and there 's an end o n't .
But now that I think , how found ye my chamber ? ''
`` I ask it of Dame Hatch , '' she answer .
`` Well , the dame 's staunch , '' he answer ; `` she 'll not tell upon you .
We have time before u . ''
And just then , a if to contradict his word , foot come down the corridor , and a fist beat roughly on the door .
`` Here ! ''
cry a voice .
`` Open , Master Dick ; open ! ''
Dick neither move nor answer .
`` It be all over , '' say the girl ; and she put her arm about Dick 's neck .
One after another , men come troop to the door .
Then Sir Daniel arrive himself , and there be a sudden cessation of the noise .
`` Dick , '' cry the knight , `` be not an as .
The Seven Sleepers have be awake ere now .
We know she be within there .
Open , then , the door , man . ''
Dick be again silent .
`` Down with it , '' say Sir Daniel .
And immediately his follower fell savagely upon the door with foot and fist .
Solid a it be , and strongly bolt , it would soon have give way ; but once more fortune interfere .
Over the thunderstorm of blow the cry of a sentinel be hear ; it be follow by another ; shout ran along the battlement , shout answer out of the wood .
In the first moment of alarm it sound a if the forester be carry the Moat House by assault .
And Sir Daniel and his men , desist instantly from their attack upon Dick 's chamber , hurry to defend the wall .
`` Now , '' cry Dick , `` we be save . ''
He seize the great old bedstead with both hand , and bent himself in vain to move it .
`` Help me , Jack .
For your life 's sake , help me stoutly ! ''
he cry .
Between them , with a huge effort , they drag the big frame of oak across the room , and thrust it endwise to the chamber door .
`` Ye do but make thing bad , '' say Joanna , sadly .
`` He will then enter by the trap . ''
`` Not so , '' reply Dick .
`` He durst not tell his secret to so many .
It be by the trap that we shall flee .
Hark !
The attack be over .
Nay , it be none ! ''
It have , indeed , be no attack ; it be the arrival of another party of straggler from the defeat of Risingham that have disturb Sir Daniel .
They have run the gauntlet under cover of the darkness ; they have be admit by the great gate ; and now , with a great stamping of hoof and jingle of accoutrement and arm , they be dismount in the court .
`` He will return anon , '' say Dick .
`` To the trap ! ''
He light a lamp , and they go together into the corner of the room .
The open chink through which some light still glitter be easily discover , and , take a stout sword from his small armoury , Dick thrust it deep into the seam , and weigh strenuously on the hilt .
The trap move , gap a little , and at length come widely open .
Seizing it with their hand , the two young folk throw it back .
It disclose a few step descend , and at the foot of them , where the would-be murderer have leave it , a burning lamp .
`` Now , '' say Dick , `` go first and take the lamp .
I will follow to close the trap . ''
So they descend one after the other , and a Dick lower the trap , the blow begin once again to thunder on the panel of the door .
CHAPTER IV -- THE PASSAGE The passage in which Dick and Joanna now find themselves be narrow , dirty , and short .
At the other end of it , a door stand partly open ; the same door , without doubt , that they have hear the man unlocking .
Heavy cobweb hung from the roof ; and the paved flooring echo hollow under the light tread .
Beyond the door there be two branch , at right angle .
Dick choose one of them at random , and the pair hurry , with echo footstep , along the hollow of the chapel roof .
The top of the arched ceiling rise like a whale 's back in the dim glimmer of the lamp .
Here and there be spyhole , conceal , on the other side , by the carving of the cornice ; and look down through one of these , Dick saw the paved floor of the chapel -- the altar , with it burning taper -- and stretch before it on the step , the figure of Sir Oliver pray with uplifted hand .
At the other end , they descend a few step .
The passage grow narrow ; the wall upon one hand be now of wood ; the noise of people talk , and a faint flickering of light , come through the interstice ; and presently they come to a round hole about the size of a man 's eye , and Dick , look down through it , behold the interior of the hall , and some half a dozen men sit , in their jack , about the table , drink deep and demolish a venison pie .
These be certainly some of the late arrival .
`` Here be no help , '' say Dick .
`` Let u try back . ''
`` Nay , '' say Joanna ; `` maybe the passage goeth farther . ''
And she push on .
But a few yard farther the passage end at the top of a short flight of step ; and it become plain that , as long a the soldier occupy the hall , escape be impossible upon that side .
They retrace their step with all imaginable speed , and set forward to explore the other branch .
It be exceedingly narrow , scarce wide enough for a large man ; and it lead them continually up and down by little break-neck stair , until even Dick have lose all notion of his whereabouts .
At length it grow both narrow and low ; the stair continue to descend ; the wall on either hand become damp and slimy to the touch ; and far in front of them they hear the squeaking and scuttling of the rat .
`` We must be in the dungeon , '' Dick remark .
`` And still there be no outlet , '' add Joanna .
`` Nay , but an outlet there must be ! ''
Dick answer .
Presently , sure enough , they come to a sharp angle , and then the passage end in a flight of step .
On the top of that there be a solid flag of stone by way of trap , and to this they both set their back .
It be immovable .
`` Some one holdeth it , '' suggest Joanna .
`` Not so , '' say Dick ; `` for be a man strong a ten , he must still yield a little .
But this resisteth like dead rock .
There be a weight upon the trap .
Here be no issue ; and , by my sooth , good Jack , we be here a fairly prisoner a though the gyves be on our ankle bone .
Sit ye then down , and let u talk .
After a while we shall return , when perchance they shall be less carefully upon their guard ; and , who knoweth ?
we may break out and stand a chance .
But , in my poor opinion , we be as good a shent . ''
`` Dick ! ''
she cry , `` alas the day that ever ye should have see me !
For like a most unhappy and unthankful maid , it be I have lead you hither . ''
`` What cheer ! ''
return Dick .
`` It be all write , and that which be write , willy nilly , cometh still to pass .
But tell me a little what manner of a maid ye be , and how ye come into Sir Daniel 's hand ; that will do good than to bemoan yourself , whether for your sake or mine . ''
`` I be an orphan , like yourself , of father and mother , '' say Joanna ; `` and for my great misfortune , Dick , and hitherto for yours , I be a rich marriage .
My Lord Foxham have me to ward ; yet it appear Sir Daniel buy the marriage of me from the king , and a right dear price he pay for it .
So here be I , poor babe , with two great and rich men fight which should marry me , and I still at nurse !
Well , then the world change , and there be a new chancellor , and Sir Daniel buy the warding of me over the Lord Foxham 's head .
And then the world change again , and Lord Foxham buy my marriage over Sir Daniel 's ; and from then to now it go on ill betwixt the two of them .
But still Lord Foxham keep me in his hand , and be a good lord to me .
And at last I be to be marry -- or sell , if ye like it good .
Five hundred pound Lord Foxham be to get for me .
Hamley be the groom 's name , and to-morrow , Dick , of all day in the year , be I to be betroth .
Had it not come to Sir Daniel , I have be wed , sure -- and never see thee , Dick -- dear Dick ! ''
And here she take his hand , and kiss it , with the pretty grace ; and Dick draw her hand to him and do the like .
`` Well , '' she go on , `` Sir Daniel take me unawares in the garden , and make me dress in these men 's clothes , which be a deadly sin for a woman ; and , besides , they fit me not .
He ride with me to Kettley , a ye saw , tell me I be to marry you ; but I , in my heart , make sure I would marry Hamley in his teeth . ''
`` Ay ! ''
cry Dick , `` and so ye love this Hamley ! ''
`` Nay , '' reply Joanna , `` not I. I do but hate Sir Daniel .
And then , Dick , ye help me , and ye be right kind , and very bold , and my heart turn towards you in mine own despite ; and now , if we can in any way compass it , I would marry you with right goodwill .
And if , by cruel destiny , it may not be , still ye 'll be dear to me .
While my heart beat , it 'll be true to you . ''
`` And I , '' say Dick , `` that never care a straw for any manner of woman until now , I take to you when I think ye be a boy .
I have a pity to you , and know not why .
When I would have belt you , the hand fail me .
But when ye own ye be a maid , Jack -- for still I will call you Jack -- I make sure ye be the maid for me .
Hark ! ''
he say , break off -- `` one cometh . ''
And indeed a heavy tread be now audible in the echoing passage , and the rat again flee in army .
Dick reconnoitre his position .
The sudden turn give him a post of vantage .
He could thus shoot in safety from the cover of the wall .
But it be plain the light be too near him , and , run some way forward , he set down the lamp in the middle of the passage , and then return to watch .
Presently , at the far end of the passage , Bennet hove in sight .
He seem to be alone , and he carry in his hand a burning torch , which make him the good mark .
`` Stand , Bennet ! ''
cry Dick .
`` Another step , and y ' be dead . ''
`` So here ye be , '' return Hatch , peer forward into the darkness .
`` I see you not .
Aha !
y ' ` ave do wisely , Dick ; y ' ` ave put your lamp before you .
By my sooth , but , though it be do to shoot my own knave body , I do rejoice to see ye profit of my lesson !
And now , what make ye ?
what seek ye here ?
Why would ye shoot upon an old , kind friend ?
And have ye the young gentlewoman there ? ''
`` Nay , Bennet , it be I should question and you answer , '' reply Dick .
`` Why be I in this jeopardy of my life ?
Why do men come privily to slay me in my bed ?
Why be I now flee in mine own guardian 's strong house , and from the friend that I have live among and never injure ? ''
`` Master Dick , Master Dick , '' say Bennet , `` what tell I you ?
Y ' be brave , but the most uncrafty lad that I can think upon ! ''
`` Well , '' return Dick , `` I see ye know all , and that I be doomed indeed .
It be well .
Here , where I be , I stay .
Let Sir Daniel get me out if he be able ! ''
Hatch be silent for a space .
`` Hark ye , '' he begin , `` return to Sir Daniel , to tell him where ye be , and how post ; for , in truth , it be to that end he send me .
But you , if ye be no fool , have best be go ere I return . ''
`` Begone ! ''
repeat Dick .
`` I would be go already , an ' I wist how .
I can not move the trap . ''
`` Put me your hand into the corner , and see what ye find there , '' reply Bennet .
`` Throgmorton 's rope be still in the brown chamber .
Fare ye well . ''
And Hatch , turn upon his heel , disappear again into the winding of the passage .
Dick instantly return for his lamp , and proceed to act upon the hint .
At one corner of the trap there be a deep cavity in the wall .
Pushing his arm into the aperture , Dick find an iron bar , which he thrust vigorously upwards .
There follow a snapping noise , and the slab of stone instantly start in it bed .
They be free of the passage .
A little exercise of strength easily raise the trap ; and they come forth into a vaulted chamber , open on one hand upon the court , where one or two fellow , with bare arm , be rub down the horse of the last arrival .
A torch or two , each stuck in an iron ring against the wall , changefully light up the scene .
CHAPTER V -- HOW DICK CHANGED SIDES Dick , blow out his lamp lest it should attract attention , lead the way up-stairs and along the corridor .
In the brown chamber the rope have be make fast to the frame of an exceed heavy and ancient bed .
It have not be detach , and Dick , take the coil to the window , begin to lower it slowly and cautiously into the darkness of the night .
Joan stood by ; but a the rope lengthen , and still Dick continue to pay it out , extreme fear begin to conquer her resolution .
`` Dick , '' she say , `` be it so deep ?
I may not essay it .
I should infallibly fall , good Dick . ''
It be just at the delicate moment of the operation that she speak .
Dick start ; the remainder of the coil slip from his grasp , and the end fell with a splash into the moat .
Instantly , from the battlement above , the voice of a sentinel cry , `` Who go ? ''
`` A murrain ! ''
cry Dick .
`` We be pay now !
Down with you -- take the rope . ''
`` I can not , '' she cry , recoil .
`` An ye can not , no more can I , '' say Shelton .
`` How can I swim the moat without you ?
Do you desert me , then ? ''
`` Dick , '' she gasp , `` I can not .
The strength be go from me . ''
`` By the mass , then , we be all shent ! ''
he shout , stamp with his foot ; and then , hear step , he run to the room door and seek to close it .
Before he could shoot the bolt , strong arm be thrust it back upon him from the other side .
He struggle for a second ; then , feel himself overpower , run back to the window .
The girl have fall against the wall in the embrasure of the window ; she be more than half insensible ; and when he try to raise her in his arm , her body be limp and unresponsive .
At the same moment the men who have force the door against him lay hold upon him .
The first he poinarded at a blow , and the others fall back for a second in some disorder , he profit by the chance , bestride the window-sill , seize the cord in both hand , and let his body slip .
The cord be knot , which make it the easy to descend ; but so furious be Dick 's hurry , and so small his experience of such gymnastics , that he span round and round in mid-air like a criminal upon a gibbet , and now beat his head , and now bruise his hand , against the rugged stonework of the wall .
The air roar in his ear ; he saw the star overhead , and the reflected star below him in the moat , whirl like dead leaf before the tempest .
And then he lose hold , and fell , and souse head over ear into the icy water .
When he come to the surface his hand encounter the rope , which , newly lighten of his weight , be swing wildly to and fro .
There be a red glow overhead , and look up , he saw , by the light of several torch and a cresset full of burn coal , the battlement line with face .
He saw the men 's eye turn hither and thither in quest of him ; but he be too far below , the light reach him not , and they look in vain .
And now he perceive that the rope be considerably too long , and he begin to struggle as well a he could towards the other side of the moat , still keep his head above water .
In this way he get much more than halfway over ; indeed the bank be almost within reach , before the rope begin to draw him back by it own weight .
Taking his courage in both hand , he leave go and make a leap for the trailing spray of willow that have already , that same evening , help Sir Daniel 's messenger to land .
He go down , rise again , sink a second time , and then his hand catch a branch , and with the speed of thought he have drag himself into the thick of the tree and clung there , drip and panting , and still half uncertain of his escape .
But all this have not be do without a considerable splashing , which have so far indicate his position to the men along the battlement .
Arrows and quarrel fell thick around him in the darkness , thick like drive hail ; and suddenly a torch be throw down -- flare through the air in it swift passage -- stuck for a moment on the edge of the bank , where it burn high and light up it whole surroundings like a bonfire -- and then , in a good hour for Dick , slip off , plump into the moat , and be instantly extinguish .
It have serve it purpose .
The marksman have have time to see the willow , and Dick ensconce among it bough ; and though the lad instantly spring high up the bank , and run for his life , he be yet not quick enough to escape a shot .
An arrow strike him in the shoulder , another graze his head .
The pain of his wound lend him wing ; and he have no sooner get upon the level than he take to his heel and run straight before him in the dark , without a thought for the direction of his flight .
For a few step missile follow him , but these soon cease ; and when at length he come to a halt and look behind , he be already a good way from the Moat House , though he could still see the torch move to and fro along it battlement .
He lean against a tree , stream with blood and water , bruise , wound , alone , and unarm .
For all that , he have save his life for that bout ; and though Joanna remain behind in the power of Sir Daniel , he neither blame himself for an accident that it have be beyond his power to prevent , nor do he augur any fatal consequence to the girl herself .
Sir Daniel be cruel , but he be not likely to be cruel to a young gentlewoman who have other protector , willing and able to bring him to account .
It be more probable he would make haste to marry her to some friend of his own .
`` Well , '' think Dick , `` between then and now I will find me the mean to bring that traitor under ; for I think , by the mass , that I be now absolve from any gratitude or obligation ; and when war be open , there be a fair chance for all . ''
In the meanwhile , here he be in a sore plight .
For some little way farther he struggle forward through the forest ; but what with the pain of his wound , the darkness of the night , and the extreme uneasiness and confusion of his mind , he soon become equally unable to guide himself or to continue to push through the close undergrowth , and he be fain at length to sit down and lean his back against a tree .
When he awake from something betwixt sleep and swooning , the grey of the morning have begin to take the place of night .
A little chilly breeze be bustle among the tree , and a he still sit star before him , only half awake , he become aware of something dark that swung to and fro among the branch , some hundred yard in front of him .
The progressive brightening of the day and the return of his own sens at last enable him to recognise the object .
It be a man hang from the bough of a tall oak .
His head have fall forward on his breast ; but at every strong puff of wind his body span round and round , and his leg and arm toss , like some ridiculous plaything .
Dick clamber to his foot , and , stagger and lean on the tree-trunks a he go , draw near to this grim object .
The bough be perhaps twenty foot above the ground , and the poor fellow have be draw up so high by his executioner that his boot swing clear above Dick 's reach ; and a his hood have be draw over his face , it be impossible to recognise the man .
Dick look about him right and leave ; and at last he perceive that the other end of the cord have be make fast to the trunk of a little hawthorn which grow , thick with blossom , under the lofty arcade of the oak .
With his dagger , which alone remain to him of all his arm , young Shelton sever the rope , and instantly , with a dead thump , the corpse fell in a heap upon the ground .
Dick raise the hood ; it be Throgmorton , Sir Daniel 's messenger .
He have not go far upon his errand .
A paper , which have apparently escape the notice of the men of the Black Arrow , stuck from the bosom of his doublet , and Dick , pull it forth , find it be Sir Daniel 's letter to Lord Wensleydale .
`` Come , '' think he , `` if the world change yet again , I may have here the wherewithal to shame Sir Daniel -- nay , and perchance to bring him to the block . ''
And he put the paper in his own bosom , say a prayer over the dead man , and set forth again through the wood .
His fatigue and weakness increase ; his ear sing , his step falter , his mind at interval fail him , so low have he be bring by loss of blood .
Doubtless he make many deviation from his true path , but at last he come out upon the high-road , not very far from Tunstall hamlet .
A rough voice bid him stand .
`` Stand ? ''
repeat Dick .
`` By the mass , but I be nearer fall . ''
And he suit the action to the word , and fell all his length upon the road .
Two men come forth out of the thicket , each in green forest jerkin , each with long-bow and quiver and short sword .
`` Why , Lawless , '' say the younger of the two , `` it be young Shelton . ''
`` Ay , this will be as good a bread to John Amend-All , '' return the other .
`` Though , faith , he hath be to the war .
Here be a tear in his scalp that must ` a ' cost him many a good ounce of blood . ''
`` And here , '' add Greensheve , `` be a hole in his shoulder that must have prick him well .
Who hath do this , think ye ?
If it be one of ours , he may all to prayer ; Ellis will give him a short shrift and a long rope . ''
`` Up with the cub , '' say Lawless .
`` Clap him on my back . ''
And then , when Dick have be hoist to his shoulder , and he have take the lad 's arm about his neck , and get a firm hold of him , the ex-Grey Friar add : `` Keep ye the post , brother Greensheve .
I will on with him by myself . ''
So Greensheve return to his ambush on the wayside , and Lawless trudge down the hill , whistle a he go , with Dick , still in a dead faint , comfortably settle on his shoulder .
The sun rise a he come out of the skirt of the wood and saw Tunstall hamlet straggle up the opposite hill .
All seem quiet , but a strong post of some half a score of archer lay close by the bridge on either side of the road , and , as soon a they perceive Lawless with his burthen , begin to bestir themselves and set arrow to string like vigilant sentry .
`` Who go ? ''
cry the man in command .
`` Will Lawless , by the rood -- ye know me as well a your own hand , '' return the outlaw , contemptuously .
`` Give the word , Lawless , '' return the other .
`` Now , Heaven lighten thee , thou great fool , '' reply Lawless .
`` Did I not tell it thee myself ?
But ye be all mad for this playing at soldier .
When I be in the greenwood , give me greenwood way ; and my word for this tide be : ' A fig for all mock soldiery ! ' ''
`` Lawless , ye but show an ill example ; give u the word , fool jester , '' say the commander of the post .
`` And if I have forget it ? ''
ask the other .
`` An ye have forget it -- a I know y ' ` ave not -- by the mass , I would clap an arrow into your big body , '' return the first .
`` Nay , an y ' be so ill a jester , '' say Lawless , `` ye shall have your word for me .
` Duckworth and Shelton ' be the word ; and here , to the illustration , be Shelton on my shoulder , and to Duckworth do I carry him . ''
`` Pass , Lawless , '' say the sentry .
`` And where be John ? ''
ask the Grey Friar .
`` He holdeth a court , by the mass , and taketh rent a to the manner born ! ''
cry another of the company .
So it prove .
When Lawless get a far up the village a the little inn , he find Ellis Duckworth surround by Sir Daniel 's tenant , and , by the right of his good company of archer , coolly take rent , and give write receipt in return for them .
By the face of the tenant , it be plain how little this proceeding please them ; for they argue very rightly that they would simply have to pay them twice .
As soon a he know what have bring Lawless , Ellis dismiss the remainder of the tenant , and , with every mark of interest and apprehension , conduct Dick into an inner chamber of the inn .
There the lad 's hurt be look to ; and he be recall , by simple remedy , to consciousness .
`` Dear lad , '' say Ellis , press his hand , `` y ' be in a friend 's hand that love your father , and love you for his sake .
Rest ye a little quietly , for ye be somewhat out of case .
Then shall ye tell me your story , and betwixt the two of u we shall find a remedy for all . ''
A little later in the day , and after Dick have awaken from a comfortable slumber to find himself still very weak , but clear in mind and easy in body , Ellis return , and sit down by the bedside , beg him , in the name of his father , to relate the circumstance of his escape from Tunstall Moat House .
There be something in the strength of Duckworth 's frame , in the honesty of his brown face , in the clearness and shrewdness of his eye , that move Dick to obey him ; and from first to last the lad tell him the story of his two day ' adventure .
`` Well , '' say Ellis , when he have do , `` see what the kind saint have do for you , Dick Shelton , not alone to save your body in so numerous and deadly peril , but to bring you into my hand that have no dearer wish than to assist your father 's son .
Be but true to me -- and I see y ' be true -- and betwixt you and me , we shall bring that false-heart traitor to the death . ''
`` Will ye assault the house ? ''
ask Dick .
`` I be mad , indeed , to think of it , '' return Ellis .
`` He hath too much power ; his men gather to him ; those that give me the slip last night , and by the mass come in so handily for you -- those have make him safe .
Nay , Dick , to the contrary , thou and I and my brave bowman , we must all slip from this forest speedily , and leave Sir Daniel free . ''
`` My mind misgiveth me for Jack , '' say the lad .
`` For Jack ! ''
repeat Duckworth .
`` O , I see , for the wench !
Nay , Dick , I promise you , if there come talk of any marriage we shall act at once ; till then , or till the time be ripe , we shall all disappear , even like shadow at morning ; Sir Daniel shall look east and west , and see none enemy ; he shall think , by the mass , that he hath dream awhile , and hath now awaken in his bed .
But our four eye , Dick , shall follow him right close , and our four hand -- so help u all the army of the saint !
-- shall bring that traitor low ! ''
Two day later Sir Daniel 's garrison have grow to such a strength that he venture on a sally , and at the head of some two score horseman , push without opposition as far a Tunstall hamlet .
Not an arrow fly , not a man stir in the thicket ; the bridge be no longer guard , but stand open to all corner ; and a Sir Daniel cross it , he saw the villager look timidly from their door .
Presently one of them , take heart of grace , come forward , and with the lowly salutation , present a letter to the knight .
His face darken a he read the content .
It run thus : To the most untrue and cruel gentylman , Sir Daniel Brackley , Knyght , These : I fynde ye be untrue and unkynd fro the first .
Ye have my father 's blood upon your hand ; let be , it will not wasshe .
Some day ye shall perish by my procurement , so much I let you to wytte ; and I let you to wytte far , that if ye seek to wed to any other the gentylwoman , Mistresse Joan Sedley , whom that I be bound upon a great oath to wed myself , the blow will be very swift .
The first step therinne will be thy first step to the grave .

BOOK III -- MY LORD FOXHAM CHAPTER I -- THE HOUSE BY THE SHORE Months have pass away since Richard Shelton make his escape from the hand of his guardian .
These month have be eventful for England .
The party of Lancaster , which be then in the very article of death , have once more raise it head .
The Yorkists defeat and disperse , their leader butcher on the field , it seem , -- for a very brief season in the winter follow upon the event already record , a if the House of Lancaster have finally triumph over it foe .
The small town of Shoreby-on-the-Till be full of the Lancastrian noble of the neighbourhood .
Earl Risingham be there , with three hundred man-at-arms ; Lord Shoreby , with two hundred ; Sir Daniel himself , high in favour and once more grow rich on confiscation , lay in a house of his own , on the main street , with three-score men .
The world have change indeed .
It be a black , bitter cold evening in the first week of January , with a hard frost , a high wind , and every likelihood of snow before the morning .
In an obscure alehouse in a by-street near the harbour , three or four men sit drink ale and eat a hasty mess of egg .
They be all likely , lusty , weather-beaten fellow , hard of hand , bold of eye ; and though they wear plain tabard , like country plowman , even a drunken soldier might have look twice before he seek a quarrel in such company .
A little apart before the huge fire sit a young man , almost a boy , dress in much the same fashion , though it be easy to see by his look that he be well bear , and might have wear a sword , have the time suit .
`` Nay , '' say one of the men at the table , `` I like it not .
Ill will come of it .
This be no place for jolly fellow .
A jolly fellow loveth open country , good cover , and scarce foe ; but here we be shut in a town , girt about with enemy ; and , for the bull 's - eye of misfortune , see if it snow not ere the morning . '' ''
'T be for Master Shelton there , '' say another , nod his head towards the lad before the fire .
`` I will do much for Master Shelton , '' return the first ; `` but to come to the gallows for any man -- nay , brother , not that ! ''
The door of the inn open , and another man enter hastily and approach the youth before the fire .
`` Master Shelton , '' he say , `` Sir Daniel goeth forth with a pair of link and four archer . ''
Dick -LRB- for this be our young friend -RRB- rise instantly to his foot .
`` Lawless , '' he say , `` ye will take John Capper 's watch .
Greensheve , follow with me .
Capper , lead forward .
We will follow him this time , an he go to York . ''
The next moment they be outside in the dark street , and Capper , the man who have just come , point to where two torch flare in the wind at a little distance .
The town be already sound asleep ; no one move upon the street , and there be nothing easy than to follow the party without observation .
The two link-bearers go first ; next follow a single man , whose long cloak blew about him in the wind ; and the rear be bring up by the four archer , each with his bow upon his arm .
They move at a brisk walk , thread the intricate lane and draw nearer to the shore .
`` He hath go each night in this direction ? ''
ask Dick , in a whisper .
`` This be the third night run , Master Shelton , '' return Capper , `` and still at the same hour and with the same small following , a though his end be secret . ''
Sir Daniel and his six men be now come to the outskirt of the country .
Shoreby be an open town , and though the Lancastrian lord who lay there keep a strong guard on the main road , it be still possible to enter or depart unseen by any of the less street or across the open country .
The lane which Sir Daniel have be follow come to an abrupt end .
Before him there be a stretch of rough down , and the noise of the sea-surf be audible upon one hand .
There be no guard in the neighbourhood , nor any light in that quarter of the town .
Dick and his two outlaw draw a little close to the object of their chase , and presently , a they come forth from between the house and could see a little farther upon either hand , they be aware of another torch draw near from another direction .
`` Hey , '' say Dick , `` I smell treason . ''
Meanwhile , Sir Daniel have come to a full halt .
The torch be stick into the sand , and the men lay down , a if to await the arrival of the other party .
This draw near at a good rate .
It consist of four men only -- a pair of archer , a varlet with a link , and a cloaked gentleman walk in their midst .
`` Is it you , my lord ? ''
cry Sir Daniel .
`` It be I , indeed ; and if ever true knight give proof I be that man , '' reply the leader of the second troop ; `` for who would not rather face giant , sorcerer , or pagan , than this pinch cold ? ''
`` My lord , '' return Sir Daniel , `` beauty will be the more beholden , misdoubt it not .
But shall we forth ?
for the sooner ye have see my merchandise , the sooner shall we both get home . ''
`` But why keep ye her here , good knight ? ''
inquire the other .
`` An she be so young , and so fair , and so wealthy , why do ye not bring her forth among her mate ?
Ye would soon make her a good marriage , and no need to freeze your finger and risk arrow-shots by go abroad at such untimely season in the dark . ''
`` I have tell you , my lord , '' reply Sir Daniel , `` the reason thereof concerneth me only .
Neither do I purpose to explain it far .
Suffice it , that if ye be weary of your old gossip , Daniel Brackley , publish it abroad that y ' be to wed Joanna Sedley , and I give you my word ye will be quit of him right soon .
Ye will find him with an arrow in his back . ''
Meantime the two gentleman be walk briskly forward over the down ; the three torch go before them , stoop against the wind and scatter cloud of smoke and tuft of flame , and the rear bring up by the six archer .
Close upon the heel of these , Dick follow .
He have , of course , hear no word of this conversation ; but he have recognise in the second of the speaker old Lord Shoreby himself , a man of an infamous reputation , whom even Sir Daniel affect , in public , to condemn .
Presently they come close down upon the beach .
The air smelt salt ; the noise of the surf increase ; and here , in a large walled garden , there stand a small house of two storey , with stable and other office .
The foremost torch-bearer unlock a door in the wall , and after the whole party have pass into the garden , again close and lock it on the other side .
Dick and his men be thus exclude from any farther following , unless they should scale the wall and thus put their neck in a trap .
They sit down in a tuft of furze and wait .
The red glow of the torch move up and down and to and fro within the enclosure , a if the link bearer steadily patrol the garden .
Twenty minute pass , and then the whole party issue forth again upon the down ; and Sir Daniel and the baron , after an elaborate salutation , separate and turn severally homeward , each with his own following of men and light .
As soon a the sound of their step have be swallow by the wind , Dick get to his foot as briskly a he be able , for he be stiff and ache with the cold .
`` Capper , ye will give me a back up , '' he say .
They advance , all three , to the wall ; Capper stoop , and Dick , get upon his shoulder , clamber on to the cope-stone .
`` Now , Greensheve , '' whisper Dick , `` follow me up here ; lie flat upon your face , that ye may be the less see ; and be ever ready to give me a hand if I fall foully on the other side . ''
And so say he drop into the garden .
It be all pitch dark ; there be no light in the house .
The wind whistle shrill among the poor shrub , and the surf beat upon the beach ; there be no other sound .
Cautiously Dick foot it forth , stumble among bush , and grope with his hand ; and presently the crisp noise of gravel underfoot tell him that he have strike upon an alley .
Here he pause , and take his crossbow from where he keep it conceal under his long tabard , he prepare it for instant action , and go forward once more with great resolution and assurance .
The path lead him straight to the group of building .
All seem to be sorely dilapidate : the window of the house be secure by crazy shutter ; the stable be open and empty ; there be no hay in the hay-loft , no corn in the corn-box .
Any one would have suppose the place to be desert .
But Dick have good reason to think otherwise .
He continue his inspection , visit the office , try all the window .
At length he come round to the sea-side of the house , and there , sure enough , there burn a pale light in one of the upper window .
He step back a little way , till he think he could see the movement of a shadow on the wall of the apartment .
Then he remember that , in the stable , his grope hand have rest for a moment on a ladder , and he return with all despatch to bring it .
The ladder be very short , but yet , by stand on the topmost round , he could bring his hand as high a the iron bar of the window ; and seize these , he raise his body by main force until his eye command the interior of the room .
Two person be within ; the first he readily know to be Dame Hatch ; the second , a tall and beautiful and grave young lady , in a long , embroidered dress -- could that be Joanna Sedley ?
his old wood-companion , Jack , whom he have think to punish with a belt ?
He drop back again to the top round of the ladder in a kind of amazement .
He have never think of his sweetheart a of so superior a be , and he be instantly take with a feeling of diffidence .
But he have little opportunity for thought .
A low `` Hist ! ''
sound from close by , and he hasten to descend the ladder .
`` Who go ? ''
he whisper .
`` Greensheve , '' come the reply , in tone similarly guard .
`` What want ye ? ''
ask Dick .
`` The house be watch , Master Shelton , '' return the outlaw .
`` We be not alone to watch it ; for even a I lay on my belly on the wall I saw men prowl in the dark , and hear them whistle softly one to the other . ''
`` By my sooth , '' say Dick , `` but this be pass strange !
Were they not men of Sir Daniel 's ? ''
`` Nay , sir , that they be not , '' return Greensheve ; `` for if I have eye in my head , every man-Jack of them weareth me a white badge in his bonnet , something chequer with dark . ''
`` White , chequer with dark , '' repeat Dick .
`` Faith , 't be a badge I know not .
It be none of this country 's badge .
Well , an that be so , let u slip a quietly forth from this garden a we may ; for here we be in an evil posture for defence .
Beyond all question there be men of Sir Daniel 's in that house , and to be take between two shot be a beggarman 's position .
Take me this ladder ; I must leave it where I find it . ''
They return the ladder to the stable , and grope their way to the place where they have enter .
Capper have take Greensheve 's position on the cope , and now he lean down his hand , and , first one and then the other , pull them up .
Cautiously and silently , they drop again upon the other side ; nor do they dare to speak until they have return to their old ambush in the gorse .
`` Now , John Capper , '' say Dick , `` back with you to Shoreby , even a for your life .
Bring me instantly what men ye can collect .
Here shall be the rendezvous ; or if the men be scatter and the day be near at hand before they muster , let the place be something far back , and by the enter in of the town .
Greensheve and I lie here to watch .
Speed ye , John Capper , and the saint aid you to despatch .
And now , Greensheve , '' he continue , as soon a Capper have depart , `` let thou and I go round about the garden in a wide circuit .
I would fain see whether thine eye betray thee . ''
Keeping well outwards from the wall , and profiting by every height and hollow , they pass about two side , behold nothing .
On the third side the garden wall be build close upon the beach , and to preserve the distance necessary to their purpose , they have to go some way down upon the sand .
Although the tide be still pretty far out , the surf be so high , and the sand so flat , that at each breaker a great sheet of froth and water come career over the expanse , and Dick and Greensheve make this part of their inspection wading , now to the ankle , and now as deep a to the knee , in the salt and icy water of the German Ocean .
Suddenly , against the comparative whiteness of the garden wall , the figure of a man be see , like a faint Chinese shadow , violently signal with both arm .
As he drop again to the earth , another arise a little farther on and repeat the same performance .
And so , like a silent watch word , these gesticulation make the round of the beleaguered garden .
`` They keep good watch , '' Dick whisper .
`` Let u back to land , good master , '' answer Greensheve .
`` We stand here too open ; for , look ye , when the sea break heavy and white out there behind u , they shall see u plainly against the foam . ''
`` Ye speak sooth , '' return Dick .
`` Ashore with u , right speedily . ''
CHAPTER II -- A SKIRMISH IN THE DARK Thoroughly drench and chill , the two adventurer return to their position in the gorse .
`` I pray Heaven that Capper make good speed ! ''
say Dick .
`` I vow a candle to St. Mary of Shoreby if he come before the hour ! ''
`` Y ' be in a hurry , Master Dick ? ''
ask Greensheve .
`` Ay , good fellow , '' answer Dick ; `` for in that house lieth my lady , whom I love , and who should these be that lie about her secretly by night ?
Unfriends , for sure ! ''
`` Well , '' return Greensheve , `` an John come speedily , we shall give a good account of them .
They be not two score at the outside -- I judge so by the spacing of their sentry -- and , take where they be , lie so widely , one score would scatter them like sparrow .
And yet , Master Dick , an she be in Sir Daniel 's power already , it will little hurt that she should change into another 's .
Who should these be ? ''
`` I do suspect the Lord of Shoreby , '' Dick reply .
`` When come they ? ''
`` They begin to come , Master Dick , '' say Greensheve , `` about the time ye cross the wall .
I have not lie there the space of a minute ere I mark the first of the knave crawl round the corner . ''
The last light have be already extinguish in the little house when they be wad in the wash of the breaker , and it be impossible to predict at what moment the lurk men about the garden wall might make their onslaught .
Of two evil , Dick prefer the least .
He prefer that Joanna should remain under the guardianship of Sir Daniel rather than pass into the clutch of Lord Shoreby ; and his mind be make up , if the house should be assault , to come at once to the relief of the besieged .
But the time pass , and still there be no movement .
From quarter of an hour to quarter of an hour the same signal pass about the garden wall , a if the leader desire to assure himself of the vigilance of his scattered follower ; but in every other particular the neighbourhood of the little house lay undisturbed .
Presently Dick 's reinforcement begin to arrive .
The night be not yet old before nearly a score of men crouch beside him in the gorse .
Separating these into two body , he take the command of the small himself , and entrust the large to the leadership of Greensheve .
`` Now , Kit , '' say he to this last , `` take me your men to the near angle of the garden wall upon the beach .
Post them strongly , and wait till that ye hear me fall on upon the other side .
It be those upon the sea front that I would fain make certain of , for there will be the leader .
The rest will run ; even let them .
And now , lad , let no man draw an arrow ; ye will but hurt friend .
Take to the steel , and keep to the steel ; and if we have the uppermost , I promise every man of you a gold noble when I come to mine estate . ''
Out of the odd collection of broken men , thief , murderer , and ruin peasantry , whom Duckworth have gather together to serve the purpose of his revenge , some of the bold and the most experienced in war have volunteer to follow Richard Shelton .
The service of watch Sir Daniel 's movement in the town of Shoreby have from the first be irksome to their temper , and they have of late begin to grumble loudly and threaten to disperse .
The prospect of a sharp encounter and possible spoil restore them to good humour , and they joyfully prepare for battle .
Their long tabard throw aside , they appear , some in plain green jerkin , and some in stout leathern jack ; under their hood many wear bonnet strengthen by iron plate ; and , for offensive armour , sword , dagger , a few stout boar-spears , and a dozen of bright bill , put them in a posture to engage even regular feudal troop .
The bow , quiver , and tabard be conceal among the gorse , and the two band set resolutely forward .
Dick , when he have reach the other side of the house , post his six men in a line , about twenty yard from the garden wall , and take position himself a few pace in front .
Then they all shout with one voice , and close upon the enemy .
These , lie widely scatter , stiff with cold , and take at unawares , spring stupidly to their foot , and stand undecided .
Before they have time to get their courage about them , or even to form an idea of the number and mettle of their assailant , a similar shout of onslaught sound in their ear from the far side of the enclosure .
Thereupon they give themselves up for lose and ran .
In this way the two small troop of the men of the Black Arrow close upon the sea front of the garden wall , and take a part of the stranger , a it be , between two fire ; while the whole of the remainder ran for their life in different direction , and be soon scatter in the darkness .
For all that , the fight be but begin .
Dick 's outlaw , although they have the advantage of the surprise , be still considerably outnumber by the men they have surround .
The tide have flow , in the meanwhile ; the beach be narrow to a strip ; and on this wet field , between the surf and the garden wall , there begin , in the darkness , a doubtful , furious , and deadly contest .
The stranger be well arm ; they fell in silence upon their assailant ; and the affray become a series of single combat .
Dick , who have come first into the mellay , be engage by three ; the first he cut down at the first blow , but the other two come upon him , hotly , he be fain to give ground before their onset .
One of these two be a huge fellow , almost a giant for stature , and arm with a two-handed sword , which he brandish like a switch .
Against this opponent , with his reach of arm and the length and weight of his weapon , Dick and his bill be quite defenceless ; and have the other continue to join vigorously in the attack , the lad must have indubitably fall .
This second man , however , less in stature and slower in his movement , pause for a moment to peer about him in the darkness , and to give ear to the sound of the battle .
The giant still pursue his advantage , and still Dick flee before him , spy for his chance .
Then the huge blade flash and descend , and the lad , leap on one side and running in , slash sideways and upwards with his bill .
A roar of agony respond , and , before the wounded man could raise his formidable weapon , Dick , twice repeat his blow , have bring him to the ground .
The next moment he be engage , upon more equal term , with his second pursuer .
Here there be no great difference in size , and though the man , fight with sword and dagger against a bill , and be wary and quick of fence , have a certain superiority of arm , Dick more than make it up by his great agility on foot .
Neither at first gain any obvious advantage ; but the old man be still insensibly profit by the ardour of the young to lead him where he would ; and presently Dick find that they have cross the whole width of the beach , and be now fight above the knee in the spume and bubble of the breaker .
Here his own superior activity be render useless ; he find himself more or less at the discretion of his foe ; yet a little , and he have his back turn upon his own men , and saw that this adroit and skilful adversary be bent upon draw him far and far away .
Dick ground his teeth .
He determine to decide the combat instantly ; and when the wash of the next wave have ebb and leave them dry , he rush in , catch a blow upon his bill , and leap right at the throat of his opponent .
The man go down backwards , with Dick still upon the top of him ; and the next wave , speedily succeed to the last , bury him below a rush of water .
While he be still submerge , Dick force his dagger from his grasp , and rise to his foot , victorious .
`` Yield ye ! ''
he say .
`` I give you life . ''
`` I yield me , '' say the other , get to his knee .
`` Ye fight , like a young man , ignorantly and foolhardily ; but , by the array of the saint , ye fight bravely ! ''
Dick turn to the beach .
The combat be still rag doubtfully in the night ; over the hoarse roar of the breaker steel clang upon steel , and cry of pain and the shout of battle resound .
`` Lead me to your captain , youth , '' say the conquered knight .
`` It be fit this butchery should cease . ''
`` Sir , '' reply Dick , `` so far a these brave fellow have a captain , the poor gentleman who here address you be he . ''
`` Call off your dog , then , and I will bid my villain hold , '' return the other .
There be something noble both in the voice and manner of his late opponent , and Dick instantly dismiss all fear of treachery .
`` Lay down your arm , men ! ''
cry the stranger knight .
`` I have yield me , upon promise of life . ''
The tone of the stranger be one of absolute command , and almost instantly the din and confusion of the mellay cease .
`` Lawless , '' cry Dick , `` be ye safe ? ''
`` Ay , '' cry Lawless , `` safe and hearty . ''
`` Light me the lantern , '' say Dick .
`` Is not Sir Daniel here ? ''
inquire the knight .
`` Sir Daniel ? ''
echoed Dick .
`` Now , by the rood , I pray not .
It would go ill with me if he be . ''
`` Ill with you , fair sir ? ''
inquire the other .
`` Nay , then , if ye be not of Sir Daniel 's party , I profess I comprehend no longer .
Wherefore , then , fell ye upon mine ambush ?
in what quarrel , my young and very fiery friend ?
to what earthly purpose ?
and , to make a clear end of question , to what good gentleman have I surrender ? ''
But before Dick could answer , a voice spoke in the darkness from close by .
Dick could see the speaker 's black and white badge , and the respectful salute which he address to his superior .
`` My lord , '' say he , `` if these gentleman be unfriends to Sir Daniel , it be pity , indeed , we should have be at blow with them ; but it be tenfold great that either they or we should linger here .
The watcher in the house -- unless they be all dead or deaf -- have hear our hammer this quarter-hour agone ; instantly they will have signal to the town ; and unless we be the livelier in our departure , we be like to be take , both of u , by a fresh foe . ''
`` Hawksley be in the right , '' add the lord .
`` How please ye , sir ?
Whither shall we march ? ''
`` Nay , my lord , '' say Dick , `` go where ye will for me .
I do begin to suspect we have some ground of friendship , and if , indeed , I begin our acquaintance somewhat ruggedly , I would not churlishly continue .
Let u , then , separate , my lord , you lay your right hand in mine ; and at the hour and place that ye shall name , let u encounter and agree . ''
`` Y ' be too trustful , boy , '' say the other ; `` but this time your trust be not misplace .
I will meet you at the point of day at St. Bride 's Cross .
Come , lads , follow ! ''
The stranger disappear from the scene with a rapidity that seem suspicious ; and , while the outlaw fell to the congenial task of rifle the dead body , Dick make once more the circuit of the garden wall to examine the front of the house .
In a little upper loophole of the roof he behold a light set ; and a it would certainly be visible in town from the back window of Sir Daniel 's mansion , he doubt not that this be the signal fear by Hawksley , and that ere long the lance of the Knight of Tunstall would arrive upon the scene .
He put his ear to the ground , and it seem to him a if he hear a jarring and hollow noise from townward .
Back to the beach he go hurry .
But the work be already do ; the last body be disarm and strip to the skin , and four fellow be already wad seaward to commit it to the mercy of the deep .
A few minute later , when there debauch out of the near lane of Shoreby some two score horseman , hastily array and move at the gallop of their steed , the neighbourhood of the house beside the sea be entirely silent and desert .
Meanwhile , Dick and his men have return to the ale-house of the Goat and Bagpipes to snatch some hour of sleep before the morning tryst .
CHAPTER III -- ST. BRIDE 'S CROSS St. Bride 's cross stand a little way back from Shoreby , on the skirt of Tunstall Forest .
Two road meet : one , from Holywood across the forest ; one , that road from Risingham down which we saw the wreck of a Lancastrian army fleeing in disorder .
Here the two join issue , and go on together down the hill to Shoreby ; and a little back from the point of junction , the summit of a little knoll be crown by the ancient and weather-beaten cross .
Here , then , about seven in the morning , Dick arrive .
It be as cold a ever ; the earth be all grey and silver with the hoarfrost , and the day begin to break in the east with many colour of purple and orange .
Dick set him down upon the low step of the cross , wrap himself well in his tabard , and look vigilantly upon all side .
He have not long to wait .
Down the road from Holywood a gentleman in very rich and bright armour , and wear over that a surcoat of the rarest fur , come pace on a splendid charger .
Twenty yard behind him follow a clump of lance ; but these halt as soon a they come in view of the trysting-place , while the gentleman in the fur surcoat continue to advance alone .
His visor be raise , and show a countenance of great command and dignity , answerable to the richness of his attire and arm .
And it be with some confusion of manner that Dick arise from the cross and step down the bank to meet his prisoner .
`` I thank you , my lord , for your exactitude , '' he say , louting very low .
`` Will it please your lordship to set foot to earth ? ''
`` Are ye here alone , young man ? ''
inquire the other .
`` I be not so simple , '' answer Dick ; `` and , to be plain with your lordship , the wood upon either hand of this cross lie full of mine honest fellow lie on their weapon . ''
`` Y ' ` ave do wisely , '' say the lord .
`` It pleaseth me the rather , since last night ye fight foolhardily , and more like a salvage Saracen lunatic than any Christian warrior .
But it become not me to complain that have the undermost . ''
`` Ye have the undermost indeed , my lord , since ye so fell , '' return Dick ; `` but have the wave not holpen me , it be I that should have have the bad .
Ye be pleased to make me yours with several dagger mark , which I still carry .
And in fine , my lord , methinks I have all the danger , as well a all the profit , of that little blind-man 's mellay on the beach . ''
`` Y ' be shrewd enough to make light of it , I see , '' return the stranger .
`` Nay , my lord , not shrewd , '' reply Dick , `` in that I shoot at no advantage to myself .
But when , by the light of this new day , I see how stout a knight hath yield , not to my arm alone , but to fortune , and the darkness , and the surf -- and how easily the battle have go otherwise , with a soldier so untried and rustic a myself -- think it not strange , my lord , if I feel confound with my victory . ''
`` Ye speak well , '' say the stranger .
`` Your name ? ''
`` My name , a n't like you , be Shelton , '' answer Dick .
`` Men call me the Lord Foxham , '' add the other .
`` Then , my lord , and under your good favour , ye be guardian to the sweet maid in England , '' reply Dick ; `` and for your ransom , and the ransom of such a be take with you on the beach , there will be no uncertainty of term .
I pray you , my lord , of your goodwill and charity , yield me the hand of my mistress , Joan Sedley ; and take ye , upon the other part , your liberty , the liberty of these your follower , and -LRB- if ye will have it -RRB- my gratitude and service till I die . ''
`` But be ye not ward to Sir Daniel ?
Methought , if y ' be Harry Shelton 's son , that I have hear it so report , '' say Lord Foxham .
`` Will it please you , my lord , to alight ?
I would fain tell you fully who I be , how situate , and why so bold in my demand .
Beseech you , my lord , take place upon these step , hear me to a full end , and judge me with allowance . ''
And so saying , Dick lend a hand to Lord Foxham to dismount ; lead him up the knoll to the cross ; instal him in the place where he have himself be sit ; and stand respectfully before his noble prisoner , relate the story of his fortune up to the event of the evening before .
Lord Foxham listen gravely , and when Dick have do , `` Master Shelton , '' he say , `` ye be a most fortunate-unfortunate young gentleman ; but what fortune y ' ` ave have , that ye have amply merit ; and what unfortune , ye have noways deserve .
Be of a good cheer ; for ye have make a friend who be devoid neither of power nor favour .
For yourself , although it fit not for a person of your birth to herd with outlaws , I must own ye be both brave and honourable ; very dangerous in battle , right courteous in peace ; a youth of excellent disposition and brave bearing .
For your estate , ye will never see them till the world shall change again ; so long a Lancaster hath the strong hand , so long shall Sir Daniel enjoy them for his own .
For my ward , it be another matter ; I have promise her before to a gentleman , a kinsman of my house , one Hamley ; the promise be old -- '' `` Ay , my lord , and now Sir Daniel hath promise her to my Lord Shoreby , '' interrupt Dick .
`` And his promise , for all it be but young , be still the likelier to be make good . '' ''
'T be the plain truth , '' return his lordship .
`` And consider , moreover , that I be your prisoner , upon no good composition than my bare life , and over and above that , that the maiden be unhappily in other hand , I will so far consent .
Aid me with your good fellow '' -- `` My lord , '' cry Dick , `` they be these same outlaw that ye blame me for consort with . ''
`` Let them be what they will , they can fight , '' return Lord Foxham .
`` Help me , then ; and if between u we regain the maid , upon my knightly honour , she shall marry you ! ''
Dick bend his knee before his prisoner ; but he , leap up lightly from the cross , catch the lad up and embrace him like a son .
`` Come , '' he say , `` an y ' be to marry Joan , we must be early friend . ''
CHAPTER IV -- THE GOOD HOPE An hour thereafter , Dick be back at the Goat and Bagpipes , break his fast , and receive the report of his messenger and sentry .
Duckworth be still absent from Shoreby ; and this be frequently the case , for he play many part in the world , share many different interest , and conduct many various affair .
He have found that fellowship of the Black Arrow , a a ruined man long for vengeance and money ; and yet among those who know him best , he be think to be the agent and emissary of the great King-maker of England , Richard , Earl of Warwick .
In his absence , at any rate , it fell upon Richard Shelton to command affair in Shoreby ; and , a he sit at meat , his mind be full of care , and his face heavy with consideration .
It have be determine , between him and the Lord Foxham , to make one bold stroke that evening , and , by brute force , to set Joanna free .
The obstacle , however , be many ; and a one after another of his scout arrive , each bring him more discomfortable news .
Sir Daniel be alarm by the skirmish of the night before .
He have increase the garrison of the house in the garden ; but not content with that , he have station horseman in all the neighbouring lane , so that he might have instant word of any movement .
Meanwhile , in the court of his mansion , steed stand saddle , and the rider , arm at every point , await but the signal to ride .
The adventure of the night appear more and more difficult of execution , till suddenly Dick 's countenance lighten .
`` Lawless ! ''
he cry , `` you that be a shipman , can ye steal me a ship ? ''
`` Master Dick , '' reply Lawless , `` if ye would back me , I would agree to steal York Minster . ''
Presently after , these two set forth and descend to the harbour .
It be a considerable basin , lie among sand hill , and surround with patch of down , ancient ruinous lumber , and tumble-down slum of the town .
Many deck ship and many open boat either lay there at anchor , or have be draw up on the beach .
A long duration of bad weather have drive them from the high sea into the shelter of the port ; and the great trooping of black cloud , and the cold squall that follow one another , now with a sprinkling of dry snow , now in a mere swoop of wind , promise no improvement but rather threaten a more serious storm in the immediate future .
The seaman , in view of the cold and the wind , have for the most part slunk ashore , and be now roar and sing in the shoreside tavern .
Many of the ship already ride unguarded at their anchor ; and a the day wear on , and the weather offer no appearance of improvement , the number be continually be augment .
It be to these desert ship , and , above all , to those of them that lay far out , that Lawless direct his attention ; while Dick , seat upon an anchor that be half embed in the sand , and give ear , now to the rude , potent , and bode voice of the gale , and now to the hoarse singing of the shipmen in a neighbouring tavern , soon forget his immediate surroundings and concern in the agreeable recollection of Lord Foxham 's promise .
He be disturb by a touch upon his shoulder .
It be Lawless , point to a small ship that lay somewhat by itself , and within but a little of the harbour mouth , where it heave regularly and smoothly on the entering swell .
A pale gleam of winter sunshine fell , at that moment , on the vessel 's deck , relieve her against a bank of scowl cloud ; and in this momentary glitter Dick could see a couple of men haul the skiff alongside .
`` There , sir , '' say Lawless , `` mark ye it well !
There be the ship for to-night . ''
Presently the skiff put out from the vessel 's side , and the two men , keep her head well to the wind , pull lustily for shore .
Lawless turn to a loiterer .
`` How call ye her ? ''
he ask , point to the little vessel .
`` They call her the Good Hope , of Dartmouth , '' reply the loiterer .
`` Her captain , Arblaster by name .
He pulleth the bow oar in yon skiff . ''
This be all that Lawless want .
Hurriedly thank the man , he move round the shore to a certain sandy creek , for which the skiff be head .
There he take up his position , and as soon a they be within earshot , opened fire on the sailor of the Good Hope .
`` What !
Gossip Arblaster ! ''
he cry .
`` Why , ye be well meet ; nay , gossip , ye be right well meet , upon the rood !
And be that the Good Hope ?
Ay , I would know her among ten thousand !
-- a sweet shear , a sweet boat !
But marry come up , my gossip , will ye drink ?
I have come into mine estate which doubtless ye remember to have hear on .
I be now rich ; I have leave to sail upon the sea ; I do sail now , for the most part , upon spice ale .
Come , fellow ; thy hand upon ` t !
Come , drink with an old shipfellow ! ''
Skipper Arblaster , a long-faced , elderly , weather-beaten man , with a knife hang about his neck by a plaited cord , and for all the world like any modern seaman in his gait and bearing , have hang back in obvious amazement and distrust .
But the name of an estate , and a certain air of tipsified simplicity and good-fellowship which Lawless very well affect , combine to conquer his suspicious jealousy ; his countenance relaxed , and he at once extend his open hand and squeeze that of the outlaw in a formidable grasp .
`` Nay , '' he say , `` I can not mind you .
But what o ' that ?
I would drink with any man , gossip , and so would my man Tom .
Man Tom , '' he add , address his follower , `` here be my gossip , whose name I can not mind , but no doubt a very good seaman .
Let 's go drink with him and his shore friend . ''
Lawless lead the way , and they be soon seat in an alehouse , which , a it be very new , and stand in an exposed and solitary station , be less crowded than those near to the centre of the port .
It be but a shed of timber , much like a blockhouse in the backwoods of to-day , and be coarsely furnish with a press or two , a number of naked bench , and board set upon barrel to play the part of table .
In the middle , and besiege by half a hundred violent draught , a fire of wreck-wood blazed and vomit thick smoke .
`` Ay , now , '' say Lawless , `` here be a shipman 's joy -- a good fire and a good stiff cup ashore , with foul weather without and an off-sea gale a-snoring in the roof !
Here 's to the Good Hope !
May she ride easy ! ''
`` Ay , '' say Skipper Arblaster , '' 't be good weather to be ashore in , that be sooth .
Man Tom , how say ye to that ?
Gossip , ye speak well , though I can never think upon your name ; but ye speak very well .
May the Good Hope ride easy !
Amen ! ''
`` Friend Dickon , '' resume Lawless , address his commander , `` ye have certain matter on hand , unless I err ?
Well , prithee be about them incontinently .
For here I be with the choice of all good company , two tough old shipmen ; and till that ye return I will go warrant these brave fellow will bide here and drink me cup for cup .
We be not like shore-men , we old , tough tarry-Johns ! ''
`` It be well meant , '' return the skipper .
`` Ye can go , boy ; for I will keep your good friend and my good gossip company till curfew -- ay , and by St. Mary , till the sun get up again !
For , look ye , when a man hath be long enough at sea , the salt getteth me into the clay upon his bone ; and let him drink a draw-well , he will never be quench . ''
Thus encourage upon all hand , Dick rise , salute his company , and go forth again into the gusty afternoon , get him as speedily a he might to the Goat and Bagpipes .
Thence he send word to my Lord Foxham that , so soon a ever the evening close , they would have a stout boat to keep the sea in .
And then lead along with him a couple of outlaw who have some experience of the sea , he return himself to the harbour and the little sandy creek .
The skiff of the Good Hope lay among many others , from which it be easily distinguish by it extreme smallness and fragility .
Indeed , when Dick and his two men have take their place , and begin to put forth out of the creek into the open harbour , the little cockle dip into the swell and stagger under every gust of wind , like a thing upon the point of sinking .
The Good Hope , a we have say , be anchor far out , where the swell be heavy .
No other vessel lay near than several cable ' length ; those that be the near be themselves entirely desert ; and a the skiff approach , a thick flurry of snow and a sudden darkening of the weather far conceal the movement of the outlaw from all possible espial .
In a trice they have leap upon the heaving deck , and the skiff be dance at the stern .
The Good Hope be capture .
She be a good stout boat , deck in the bow and amidships , but open in the stern .
She carry one mast , and be rig between a felucca and a lugger .
It would seem that Skipper Arblaster have make an excellent venture , for the hold be full of piece of French wine ; and in the little cabin , besides the Virgin Mary in the bulkhead which prove the captain 's piety , there be many lockfast chest and cupboard , which show him to be rich and careful .
A dog , who be the sole occupant of the vessel , furiously bark and bite the heel of the boarder ; but he be soon kick into the cabin , and the door shut upon his just resentment .
A lamp be lit and fix in the shroud to mark the vessel clearly from the shore ; one of the wine piece in the hold be broach , and a cup of excellent Gascony empty to the adventure of the evening ; and then , while one of the outlaw begin to get ready his bow and arrow and prepare to hold the ship against all comer , the other haul in the skiff and get overboard , where he hold on , wait for Dick .
`` Well , Jack , keep me a good watch , '' say the young commander , prepare to follow his subordinate .
`` Ye will do right well . ''
`` Why , '' return Jack , `` I shall do excellent well indeed , so long a we lie here ; but once we put the nose of this poor ship outside the harbour -- See , there she tremble !
Nay , the poor shrew hear the word , and the heart misgive her in her oak-tree rib .
But look , Master Dick !
how black the weather gather ! ''
The darkness ahead be , indeed , astonish .
Great billow heave up out of the blackness , one after another ; and one after another the Good Hope buoyantly climb , and giddily plunge upon the further side .
A thin sprinkle of snow and thin flake of foam come fly , and powder the deck ; and the wind harp dismally among the rigging .
`` In sooth , it looketh evilly , '' say Dick .
`` But what cheer !
'T be but a squall , and presently it will blow over . ''
But , in spite of his word , he be depressingly affect by the bleak disorder of the sky and the wailing and fluting of the wind ; and a he get over the side of the Good Hope and make once more for the landing-creek with the best speed of oar , he cross himself devoutly , and recommend to Heaven the life of all who should adventure on the sea .
At the landing-creek there have already gather about a dozen of the outlaw .
To these the skiff be leave , and they be bidden embark without delay .
A little further up the beach Dick find Lord Foxham hurry in quest of him , his face conceal with a dark hood , and his bright armour cover by a long russet mantle of a poor appearance .
`` Young Shelton , '' he say , `` be ye for sea , then , truly ? ''
`` My lord , '' reply Richard , `` they lie about the house with horseman ; it may not be reach from the land side without alarum ; and Sir Daniel once advertise of our adventure , we can no more carry it to a good end than , save your presence , we could ride upon the wind .
Now , in go round by sea , we do run some peril by the element ; but , what much outweighteth all , we have a chance to make good our purpose and bear off the maid . ''
`` Well , '' return Lord Foxham , `` lead on .
I will , in some sort , follow you for shame 's sake ; but I own I would I be in bed . ''
`` Here , then , '' say Dick .
`` Hither we go to fetch our pilot . ''
And he lead the way to the rude alehouse where he have give rendezvous to a portion of his men .
Some of these he find linger round the door outside ; others have push more boldly in , and , choose place as near a possible to where they saw their comrade , gather close about Lawless and the two shipmen .
These , to judge by the distempered countenance and cloudy eye , have long since go beyond the boundary of moderation ; and a Richard enter , closely follow by Lord Foxham , they be all three tune up an old , pitiful sea-ditty , to the chorus of the wailing of the gale .
The young leader cast a rapid glance about the shed .
The fire have just be replenish , and give forth volume of black smoke , so that it be difficult to see clearly in the further corner .
It be plain , however , that the outlaws very largely outnumber the remainder of the guest .
Satisfied upon this point , in case of any failure in the operation of his plan , Dick stride up to the table and resume his place upon the bench .
`` Hey ? ''
cry the skipper , tipsily , `` who be ye , hey ? ''
`` I want a word with you without , Master Arblaster , '' return Dick ; `` and here be what we shall talk of . ''
And he show him a gold noble in the glimmer of the firelight .
The shipman 's eye burn , although he still fail to recognise our hero .
`` Ay , boy , '' he say , `` I be with you .
Gossip , I will be back anon .
Drink fair , gossip ; '' and , take Dick 's arm to steady his uneven step , he walk to the door of the alehouse .
As soon a he be over the threshold , ten strong arm have seize and bound him ; and in two minute more , with his limb truss one to another , and a good gag in his mouth , he have be tumble neck and crop into a neighbouring hay-barn .
Presently , his man Tom , similarly secure , be toss beside him , and the pair be leave to their uncouth reflection for the night .
And now , a the time for concealment have go by , Lord Foxham 's follower be summon by a preconcerted signal , and the party , boldly take possession of as many boat a their number require , pull in a flotilla for the light in the rigging of the ship .
Long before the last man have climb to the deck of the Good Hope , the sound of furious shout from the shore show that a part , at least , of the seaman have discover the loss of their skiff .
But it be now too late , whether for recovery or revenge .
Out of some forty fight men now muster in the stolen ship , eight have be to sea , and could play the part of mariner .
With the aid of these , a slice of sail be get upon her .
The cable be cut .
Lawless , vacillate on his foot , and still shout the chorus of sea-ballads , take the long tiller in his hand : and the Good Hope begin to flit forward into the darkness of the night , and to face the great wave beyond the harbour bar .
Richard take his place beside the weather rigging .
Except for the ship 's own lantern , and for some light in Shoreby town , that be already fade to leeward , the whole world of air be as black a in a pit .
Only from time to time , a the Good Hope swoop dizzily down into the valley of the roller , a crest would break -- a great cataract of snowy foam would leap in one instant into be -- and , in an instant more , would stream into the wake and vanish .
Many of the men lay hold on and pray aloud ; many more be sick , and have creep into the bottom , where they sprawl among the cargo .
And what with the extreme violence of the motion , and the continue drunken bravado of Lawless , still shout and sing at the helm , the stout heart on board may have nourish a shrewd misgiving a to the result .
But Lawless , a if guide by an instinct , steer the ship across the breaker , strike the lee of a great sandbank , where they sail for awhile in smooth water , and presently after lay her alongside a rude , stone pier , where she be hastily make fast , and lay duck and grind in the dark .
CHAPTER V -- THE GOOD HOPE -LRB- continue -RRB- The pier be not far distant from the house in which Joanna lay ; it now only remain to get the men on shore , to surround the house with a strong party , burst in the door and carry off the captive .
They might then regard themselves a do with the Good Hope ; it have place them on the rear of their enemy ; and the retreat , whether they should succeed or fail in the main enterprise , would be direct with a great measure of hope in the direction of the forest and my Lord Foxham 's reserve .
To get the men on shore , however , be no easy task ; many have be sick , all be pierce with cold ; the promiscuity and disorder on board have shake their discipline ; the movement of the ship and the darkness of the night have cow their spirit .
They make a rush upon the pier ; my lord , with his sword drawn on his own retainer , must throw himself in front ; and this impulse of rabblement be not restrain without a certain clamour of voice , highly to be regret in the case .
When some degree of order have be restore , Dick , with a few chosen men , set forth in advance .
The darkness on shore , by contrast with the flashing of the surf , appear before him like a solid body ; and the howling and whistling of the gale drown any less noise .
He have scarce reach the end of the pier , however , when there fell a lull of the wind ; and in this he seem to hear on shore the hollow footing of horse and the clash of arm .
Checking his immediate follower , he pass forward a step or two alone , even set foot upon the down ; and here he make sure he could detect the shape of men and horse move .
A strong discouragement assail him .
If their enemy be really on the watch , if they have beleaguer the shoreward end of the pier , he and Lord Foxham be take in a posture of very poor defence , the sea behind , the men jostle in the dark upon a narrow causeway .
He give a cautious whistle , the signal previously agree upon .
It prove to be a signal far more than he desire .
Instantly there fell , through the black night , a shower of arrow send at a venture ; and so close be the men huddle on the pier that more than one be hit , and the arrow be answer with cry of both fear and pain .
In this first discharge , Lord Foxham be strike down ; Hawksley have him carry on board again at once ; and his men , during the brief remainder of the skirmish , fight -LRB- when they fight at all -RRB- without guidance .
That be perhaps the chief cause of the disaster which make haste to follow .
At the shore end of the pier , for perhaps a minute , Dick hold his own with a handful ; one or two be wound upon either side ; steel cross steel ; nor have there be the least signal of advantage , when in the twinkling of an eye the tide turn against the party from the ship .
Someone cry out that all be lose ; the men be in the very humour to lend an ear to a discomfortable counsel ; the cry be take up .
`` On board , lad , for your life ! ''
cry another .
A third , with the true instinct of the coward , raise that inevitable report on all retreat : `` We be betray ! ''
And in a moment the whole mass of men go surge and jostle backward down the pier , turn their defenceless back on their pursuer and pierce the night with craven outcry .
One coward thrust off the ship 's stern , while another still hold her by the bow .
The fugitive leap , scream , and be haul on board , or fell back and perish in the sea .
Some be cut down upon the pier by the pursuer .
Many be injure on the ship 's deck in the blind haste and terror of the moment , one man leap upon another , and a third on both .
At last , and whether by design or accident , the bow of the Good Hope be liberate ; and the ever-ready Lawless , who have maintain his place at the helm through all the hurly-burly by sheer strength of body and a liberal use of the cold steel , instantly clap her on the proper tack .
The ship begin to move once more forward on the stormy sea , it scupper run blood , it deck heap with fall men , sprawl and struggle in the dark .
Thereupon , Lawless sheathe his dagger , and turn to his next neighbour , `` I have leave my mark on them , gossip , '' say he , `` the yelping , coward hound . ''
Now , while they be all leaping and struggle for their life , the men have not appear to observe the rough shove and cut stab with which Lawless have hold his post in the confusion .
But perhaps they have already begin to understand somewhat more clearly , or perhaps another ear have overhear , the helmsman 's speech .
Panic-stricken troop recover slowly , and men who have just disgrace themselves by cowardice , a if to wipe out the memory of their fault , will sometimes run straight into the opposite extreme of insubordination .
So it be now ; and the same men who have throw away their weapon and be haul , foot foremost , into the Good Hope , begin to cry out upon their leader , and demand that someone should be punish .
This grow ill-feeling turn upon Lawless .
In order to get a proper offing , the old outlaw have put the head of the Good Hope to seaward .
`` What ! ''
bawl one of the grumbler , `` he carrieth u to seaward ! '' ''
'T be sooth , '' cry another .
`` Nay , we be betray for sure . ''
And they all begin to cry out in chorus that they be betray , and in shrill tone and with abominable oath bid Lawless go about-ship and bring them speedily ashore .
Lawless , grind his teeth , continue in silence to steer the true course , guide the Good Hope among the formidable billow .
To their empty terror , a to their dishonourable threat , between drink and dignity he scorn to make reply .
The malcontent draw together a little abaft the mast , and it be plain they be like barnyard cock , `` crow for courage . ''
Presently they would be fit for any extremity of injustice or ingratitude .
Dick begin to mount by the ladder , eager to interpose ; but one of the outlaw , who be also something of a seaman , get beforehand .
`` Lads , '' he begin , `` y ' be right wooden head , I think .
For to get back , by the mass , we must have an offing , must we not ?
And this old Lawless -- '' Someone strike the speaker on the mouth , and the next moment , a a fire spring among dry straw , he be fell upon the deck , trample under the foot , and despatch by the dagger of his cowardly companion .
At this the wrath of Lawless rise and break .
`` Steer yourselves , '' he bellow , with a curse ; and , careless of the result , he leave the helm .
The Good Hope be , at that moment , tremble on the summit of a swell .
She subside , with sicken velocity , upon the farther side .
A wave , like a great black bulwark , heave immediately in front of her ; and , with a staggering blow , she plunge headforemost through that liquid hill .
The green water pass right over her from stem to stern , as high a a man 's knee ; the spray run high than the mast ; and she rise again upon the other side , with an appalling , tremulous indecision , like a beast that have be deadly wound .
Six or seven of the malcontent have be carry bodily overboard ; and a for the remainder , when they find their tongue again , it be to bellow to the saint and wail upon Lawless to come back and take the tiller .
Nor do Lawless wait to be twice bidden .
The terrible result of his fling of just resentment sober him completely .
He know , good than any one on board , how nearly the Good Hope have go bodily down below their foot ; and he could tell , by the laziness with which she meet the sea , that the peril be by no mean over .
Dick , who have be throw down by the concussion and half drown , rise wad to his knee in the swamped well of the stern , and crept to the old helmsman 's side .
`` Lawless , '' he say , `` we do all depend on you ; y ' be a brave , steady man , indeed , and crafty in the management of ship ; I shall put three sure men to watch upon your safety . ''
`` Bootless , my master , bootless , '' say the steersman , peer forward through the dark .
`` We come every moment somewhat clear of these sandbank ; with every moment , then , the sea packeth upon u heavy , and for all these whimperers , they will presently be on their back .
For , my master , 't be a right mystery , but true , there never yet be a bad man that be a good shipman .
None but the honest and the bold can endure me this tossing of a ship . ''
`` Nay , Lawless , '' say Dick , laughing , `` that be a right shipman 's byword , and hath no more of sense than the whistle of the wind .
But , prithee , how go we ?
Do we lie well ?
Are we in good case ? ''
`` Master Shelton , '' reply Lawless , `` I have be a Grey Friar -- I praise fortune -- an archer , a thief , and a shipman .
Of all these coat , I have the best fancy to die in the Grey Friar 's , a ye may readily conceive , and the least fancy to die in John Shipman 's tarry jacket ; and that for two excellent good reason : first , that the death might take a man suddenly ; and second , for the horror of that great , salt smother and welter under my foot here '' -- and Lawless stamp with his foot .
`` Howbeit , '' he go on , `` an I die not a sailor 's death , and that this night , I shall owe a tall candle to our Lady . ''
`` Is it so ? ''
ask Dick .
`` It be right so , '' reply the outlaw .
`` Do ye not feel how heavy and dull she move upon the wave ?
Do ye not hear the water wash in her hold ?
She will scarce mind the rudder even now .
Bide till she have settle a bit lower ; and she will either go down below your boot like a stone image , or drive ashore here , under our lee , and come all to piece like a twist of string . ''
`` Ye speak with a good courage , '' return Dick .
`` Ye be not then appal ? ''
`` Why , master , '' answer Lawless , `` if ever a man have an ill crew to come to port with , it be I -- a renegade friar , a thief , and all the rest o n't .
Well , ye may wonder , but I keep a good hope in my wallet ; and if that I be to drown , I will drown with a bright eye , Master Shelton , and a steady hand . ''
Dick return no answer ; but he be surprise to find the old vagabond of so resolute a temper , and fear some fresh violence or treachery , set forth upon his quest for three sure men .
The great bulk of the men have now desert the deck , which be continually wet with the fly spray , and where they lay expose to the shrewdness of the winter wind .
They have gather , instead , into the hold of the merchandise , among the butt of wine , and light by two swing lantern .
Here a few kept up the form of revelry , and toast each other deep in Arblaster 's Gascony wine .
But a the Good Hope continue to tear through the smoking wave , and toss her stem and stern alternately high in air and deep into white foam , the number of these jolly companion diminish with every moment and with every lurch .
Many sit apart , tend their hurt , but the majority be already prostrate with sickness , and lay moan in the bilge .
Greensheve , Cuckow , and a young fellow of Lord Foxham 's whom Dick have already remark for his intelligence and spirit , be still , however , both fit to understand and willing to obey .
These Dick set , a a body-guard , about the person of the steersman , and then , with a last look at the black sky and sea , he turn and go below into the cabin , whither Lord Foxham have be carry by his servant .
CHAPTER VI -- THE GOOD HOPE -LRB- conclude -RRB- The moan of the wounded baron blend with the wailing of the ship 's dog .
The poor animal , whether he be merely sick at heart to be separate from his friend , or whether he indeed recognise some peril in the labouring of the ship , raise his cry , like minute-guns , above the roar of wave and weather ; and the more superstitious of the men hear , in these sound , the knell of the Good Hope .
Lord Foxham have be lay in a berth upon a fur cloak .
A little lamp burn dim before the Virgin in the bulkhead , and by it glimmer Dick could see the pale countenance and hollow eye of the hurt man .
`` I be sore hurt , '' say he .
`` Come near to my side , young Shelton ; let there be one by me who , at least , be gentle born ; for after have live nobly and richly all the day of my life , this be a sad pas that I should get my hurt in a little ferreting skirmish , and die here , in a foul , cold ship upon the sea , among break men and churl . ''
`` Nay , my lord , '' say Dick , `` I pray rather to the saint that ye will recover you of your hurt , and come soon and sound ashore . ''
`` How ! ''
demand his lordship .
`` Come sound ashore ?
There be , then , a question of it ? ''
`` The ship laboureth -- the sea be grievous and contrary , '' reply the lad ; `` and by what I can learn of my fellow that steereth u , we shall do well , indeed , if we come dryshod to land . ''
`` Ha ! ''
say the baron , gloomily , `` thus shall every terror attend upon the passage of my soul !
Sir , pray rather to live hard , that ye may die easy , than to be fool and flute all through life , a to the pipe and tabor , and , in the last hour , be plunge among misfortune !
Howbeit , I have that upon my mind that must not be delay .
We have no priest aboard ? ''
`` None , '' reply Dick .
`` Here , then , to my secular interest , '' resume Lord Foxham : `` ye must be a good a friend to me dead , a I find you a gallant enemy when I be live .
I fall in an evil hour for me , for England , and for them that trust me .
My men be be bring by Hamley -- he that be your rival ; they will rendezvous in the long holm at Holywood ; this ring from off my finger will accredit you to represent mine order ; and I shall write , besides , two word upon this paper , bid Hamley yield to you the damsel .
Will he obey ?
I know not . ''
`` But , my lord , what order ? ''
inquire Dick .
`` Ay , '' quoth the baron , `` ay -- the order ; '' and he look upon Dick with hesitation .
`` Are ye Lancaster or York ? ''
he ask , at length .
`` I shame to say it , '' answer Dick , `` I can scarce clearly answer .
But so much I think be certain : since I serve with Ellis Duckworth , I serve the house of York .
Well , if that be so , I declare for York . ''
`` It be well , '' return the other ; `` it be exceed well .
For , truly , have ye say Lancaster , I wot not for the world what I have do .
But sith ye be for York , follow me .
I come hither but to watch these lord at Shoreby , while mine excellent young lord , Richard of Gloucester , -LCB- 1 -RCB- prepareth a sufficient force to fall upon and scatter them .
I have make me note of their strength , what watch they keep , and how they lie ; and these I be to deliver to my young lord on Sunday , an hour before noon , at St. Bride 's Cross beside the forest .
This tryst I be not like to keep , but I pray you , of courtesy , to keep it in my stead ; and see that not pleasure , nor pain , tempest , wound , nor pestilence withhold you from the hour and place , for the welfare of England lieth upon this cast . ''
`` I do soberly take this up on me , '' say Dick .
`` In so far a in me lieth , your purpose shall be do . ''
`` It be good , '' say the wounded man .
`` My lord duke shall order you farther , and if ye obey him with spirit and good will , then be your fortune make .
Give me the lamp a little nearer to mine eye , till that I write these word for you . ''
He write a note `` to his worshipful kinsman , Sir John Hamley ; '' and then a second , which he-left without external superscripture .
`` This be for the duke , '' he say .
`` The word be ` England and Edward , ' and the counter , ` England and York . ' ''
`` And Joanna , my lord ? ''
ask Dick .
`` Nay , ye must get Joanna how ye can , '' reply the baron .
`` I have name you for my choice in both these letter ; but ye must get her for yourself , boy .
I have try , a ye see here before you , and have lose my life .
More could no man do . ''
By this time the wounded man begin to be very weary ; and Dick , put the precious paper in his bosom , bid him be of good cheer , and leave him to repose .
The day be begin to break , cold and blue , with fly squall of snow .
Close under the lee of the Good Hope , the coast lay in alternate rocky headland and sandy bay ; and far inland the wooded hill-tops of Tunstall show along the sky .
Both the wind and the sea have go down ; but the vessel wallow deep , and scarce rise upon the wave .
Lawless be still fix at the rudder ; and by this time nearly all the men have crawl on deck , and be now gaze , with blank face , upon the inhospitable coast .
`` Are we go ashore ? ''
ask Dick .
`` Ay , '' say Lawless , `` unless we get first to the bottom . ''
And just then the ship rise so languidly to meet a sea , and the water welter so loudly in her hold , that Dick involuntarily seize the steersman by the arm .
`` By the mass ! ''
cry Dick , a the bow of the Good Hope reappear above the foam , `` I think we have founder , indeed ; my heart be at my throat . ''
In the waist , Greensheve , Hawksley , and the good men of both company be busy break up the deck to build a raft ; and to these Dick join himself , work the harder to drown the memory of his predicament .
But , even a he work , every sea that strike the poor ship , and every one of her dull lurch , a she tumble wallow among the wave , recall him with a horrid pang to the immediate proximity of death .
Presently , look up from his work , he saw that they be close in below a promontory ; a piece of ruinous cliff , against the base of which the sea break white and heavy , almost overplumbed the deck ; and , above that , again , a house appear , crown a down .
Inside the bay the sea run gayly , raise the Good Hope upon their foam-flecked shoulder , carry her beyond the control of the steersman , and in a moment drop her , with a great concussion , on the sand , and begin to break over her half-mast high , and roll her to and fro .
Another great wave follow , raise her again , and carry her yet farther in ; and then a third succeed , and leave her far inshore of the more dangerous breaker , wedge upon a bank .
`` Now , boy , '' cry Lawless , `` the saint have have a care of u , indeed .
The tide ebb ; let u but sit down and drink a cup of wine , and before half an hour ye may all march me ashore as safe a on a bridge . ''
A barrel be broach , and , sit in what shelter they could find from the fly snow and spray , the shipwreck company hand the cup around , and seek to warm their body and restore their spirit .
Dick , meanwhile , return to Lord Foxham , who lay in great perplexity and fear , the floor of his cabin wash knee-deep in water , and the lamp , which have be his only light , broken and extinguish by the violence of the blow .
`` My lord , '' say young Shelton , `` fear not at all ; the saint be plainly for u ; the sea have cast u high upon a shoal , and as soon a the tide hath somewhat ebb , we may walk ashore upon our foot . ''
It be nearly an hour before the vessel be sufficiently desert by the ebb sea ; and they could set forth for the land , which appear dimly before them through a veil of drive snow .
Upon a hillock on one side of their way a party of men lay huddle together , suspiciously observe the movement of the new arrival .
`` They might draw near and offer u some comfort , '' Dick remark .
`` Well , an ' they come not to u , let u even turn aside to them , '' say Hawksley .
`` The sooner we come to a good fire and a dry bed the good for my poor lord . ''
But they have not move far in the direction of the hillock , before the men , with one consent , rise suddenly to their foot , and pour a flight of well-directed arrow on the shipwreck company .
`` Back !
back ! ''
cry his lordship .
`` Beware , in Heaven 's name , that ye reply not . ''
`` Nay , '' cry Greensheve , pull an arrow from his leather jack .
`` We be in no posture to fight , it be certain , be drench wet , dog-weary , and three-parts freeze ; but , for the love of old England , what aileth them to shoot thus cruelly on their poor country people in distress ? ''
`` They take u to be French pirate , '' answer Lord Foxham .
`` In these most troublesome and degenerate day we can not keep our own shore of England ; but our old enemy , whom we once chase on sea and land , do now range at pleasure , rob and slaughter and burning .
It be the pity and reproach of this poor land . ''
The men upon the hillock lay , closely observe them , while they trail upward from the beach and wound inland among desolate sand-hills ; for a mile or so they even hang upon the rear of the march , ready , at a sign , to pour another volley on the weary and dispirited fugitive ; and it be only when , strike at length upon a firm high-road , Dick begin to call his men to some more martial order , that these jealous guardian of the coast of England silently disappear among the snow .
They have do what they desire ; they have protect their own home and farm , their own family and cattle ; and their private interest be thus secure , it matter not the weight of a straw to any one of them , although the Frenchmen should carry blood and fire to every other parish in the realm of England .
BOOK IV -- THE DISGUISE CHAPTER I -- THE DEN The place where Dick have strike the line of a high-road be not far from Holywood , and within nine or ten mile of Shoreby-on-the-Till ; and here , after make sure that they be pursue no longer , the two body separate .
Lord Foxham 's follower depart , carry their wounded master towards the comfort and security of the great abbey ; and Dick , a he saw them wind away and disappear in the thick curtain of the fall snow , be leave alone with near upon a dozen outlaw , the last remainder of his troop of volunteer .
Some be wound ; one and all be furious at their ill-success and long exposure ; and though they be now too cold and hungry to do more , they grumble and cast sullen look upon their leader .
Dick empty his purse among them , leave himself nothing ; thank them for the courage they have display , though he could have find it more readily in his heart to rate them for poltroonery ; and have thus somewhat soften the effect of his prolonged misfortune , despatch them to find their way , either severally or in pair , to Shoreby and the Goat and Bagpipes .
For his own part , influence by what he have see on board of the Good Hope , he choose Lawless to be his companion on the walk .
The snow be fall , without pause or variation , in one even , blind cloud ; the wind have be strangle , and now blow no longer ; and the whole world be blot out and sheet down below that silent inundation .
There be great danger of wander by the way and perishing in drift ; and Lawless , keep half a step in front of his companion , and hold his head forward like a hunting dog upon the scent , inquire his way of every tree , and study out their path a though he be con a ship among danger .
About a mile into the forest they come to a place where several way meet , under a grove of lofty and contort oak .
Even in the narrow horizon of the fall snow , it be a spot that could not fail to be recognise ; and Lawless evidently recognise it with particular delight .
`` Now , Master Richard , '' say he , `` an y ' be not too proud to be the guest of a man who be neither a gentleman by birth nor so much a a good Christian , I can offer you a cup of wine and a good fire to melt the marrow in your frozen bone . ''
`` Lead on , Will , '' answer Dick .
`` A cup of wine and a good fire !
Nay , I would go a far way round to see them . ''
Lawless turn aside under the bare branch of the grove , and , walk resolutely forward for some time , come to a steepish hollow or den , that have now drift a quarter full of snow .
On the verge , a great beech-tree hung , precariously root ; and here the old outlaw , pull aside some bushy underwood , bodily disappear into the earth .
The beech have , in some violent gale , be half-uprooted , and have tear up a considerable stretch of turf and it be under this that old Lawless have dig out his forest hiding-place .
The root serve him for rafter , the turf be his thatch ; for wall and floor he have his mother the earth .
Rude a it be , the hearth in one corner , blacken by fire , and the presence in another of a large oaken chest well fortify with iron , show it at one glance to be the den of a man , and not the burrow of a digging beast .
Though the snow have drift at the mouth and sift in upon the floor of this earth cavern , yet be the air much warm than without ; and when Lawless have strike a spark , and the dry furze bush have begin to blaze and crackle on the hearth , the place assume , even to the eye , an air of comfort and of home .
With a sigh of great contentment , Lawless spread his broad hand before the fire , and seem to breathe the smoke .
`` Here , then , '' he say , `` be this old Lawless 's rabbit-hole ; pray Heaven there come no terrier !
Far I have roll hither and thither , and here and about , since that I be fourteen year of mine age and first run away from mine abbey , with the sacrist 's gold chain and a mass-book that I sell for four mark .
I have be in England and France and Burgundy , and in Spain , too , on a pilgrimage for my poor soul ; and upon the sea , which be no man 's country .
But here be my place , Master Shelton .
This be my native land , this burrow in the earth !
Come rain or wind -- and whether it 's April , and the bird all sing , and the blossom fall about my bed -- or whether it 's winter , and I sit alone with my good gossip the fire , and robin red breast twitter in the wood -- here , be my church and market , and my wife and child .
It 's here I come back to , and it 's here , so please the saint , that I would like to die . '' ''
'T be a warm corner , to be sure , '' reply Dick , `` and a pleasant , and a well hid . ''
`` It have need to be , '' return Lawless , `` for an they find it , Master Shelton , it would break my heart .
But here , '' he add , burrow with his stout finger in the sandy floor , `` here be my wine cellar ; and ye shall have a flask of excellent strong stingo . ''
Sure enough , after but a little digging , he produce a big leathern bottle of about a gallon , nearly three-parts full of a very heady and sweet wine ; and when they have drink to each other comradely , and the fire have be replenish and blaze up again , the pair lay at full length , thaw and steaming , and divinely warm .
`` Master Shelton , '' observe the outlaw , `` y ' ` ave have two mischance this last while , and y ' be like to lose the maid -- do I take it aright ? ''
`` Aright ! ''
return Dick , nod his head .
`` Well , now , '' continue Lawless , `` hear an old fool that hath be nigh-hand everything , and see nigh-hand all !
Ye go too much on other people 's errand , Master Dick .
Ye go on Ellis 's ; but he desireth rather the death of Sir Daniel .
Ye go on Lord Foxham 's ; well -- the saint preserve him !
-- doubtless he meaneth well .
But go ye upon your own , good Dick .
Come right to the maid 's side .
Court her , l that she forget you .
Be ready ; and when the chance shall come , off with her at the saddle-bow . ''
`` Ay , but , Lawless , beyond doubt she be now in Sir Daniel 's own mansion . ''
answer Dick .
`` Thither , then , go we , '' reply the outlaw .
Dick star at him .
`` Nay , I mean it , '' nod Lawless .
`` And if y ' be of so little faith , and stumble at a word , see here ! ''
And the outlaw , take a key from about his neck , open the oak chest , and dip and grope deep among it content , produce first a friar 's robe , and next a girdle of rope ; and then a huge rosary of wood , heavy enough to be count a a weapon .
`` Here , '' he say , `` be for you .
On with them ! ''
And then , when Dick have clothe himself in this clerical disguise , Lawless produce some colour and a pencil , and proceed , with the great cunning , to disguise his face .
The eyebrow he thicken and produce ; to the moustache , which be yet hardly visible , he render a like service ; while , by a few line around the eye , he change the expression and increase the apparent age of this young monk .
`` Now , '' he resume , `` when I have do the like , we shall make a bonny a pair of friar a the eye could wish .
Boldly to Sir Daniel 's we shall go , and there be hospitably welcome for the love of Mother Church . ''
`` And how , dear Lawless , '' cry the lad , `` shall I repay you ? ''
`` Tut , brother , '' reply the outlaw , `` I do naught but for my pleasure .
Mind not for me .
I be one , by the mass , that mindeth for himself .
When that I lack , I have a long tongue and a voice like the monastery bell -- I do ask , my son ; and where ask faileth , I do most usually take . ''
The old rogue make a humorous grimace ; and although Dick be displease to lie under so great favour to so equivocal a personage , he be yet unable to restrain his mirth .
With that , Lawless return to the big chest , and be soon similarly disguise ; but , below his gown , Dick wonder to observe him conceal a sheaf of black arrow .
`` Wherefore do ye that ? ''
ask the lad .
`` Wherefore arrow , when ye take no bow ? ''
`` Nay , '' reply Lawless , lightly , '' 't be like there will be head break -- not to say back -- ere you and I win sound from where we 're go to ; and if any fall , I would our fellowship should come by the credit o n't .
A black arrow , Master Dick , be the seal of our abbey ; it showeth you who writ the bill . ''
`` An ye prepare so carefully , '' say Dick , `` I have here some paper that , for mine own sake , and the interest of those that trust me , be good leave behind than find upon my body .
Where shall I conceal them , Will ? ''
`` Nay , '' reply Lawless , `` I will go forth into the wood and whistle me three verse of a song ; meanwhile , do you bury them where ye please , and smooth the sand upon the place . ''
`` Never ! ''
cry Richard .
`` I trust you , man .
I be base indeed if I not trust you . ''
`` Brother , y ' be but a child , '' reply the old outlaw , pause and turn his face upon Dick from the threshold of the den .
`` I be a kind old Christian , and no traitor to men 's blood , and no sparer of mine own in a friend 's jeopardy .
But , fool , child , I be a thief by trade and birth and habit .
If my bottle be empty and my mouth dry , I would rob you , dear child , as sure a I love , honour , and admire your part and person !
Can it be clearer speak ?
No . ''
And he stump forth through the bush with a snap of his big finger .
Dick , thus leave alone , after a wondering think upon the inconsistency of his companion 's character , hastily produce , review , and bury his paper .
One only he reserve to carry along with him , since it in nowise compromise his friend , and yet might serve him , in a pinch , against Sir Daniel .
That be the knight 's own letter to Lord Wensleydale , send by Throgmorton , on the morrow of the defeat at Risingham , and find next day by Dick upon the body of the messenger .
Then , tread down the ember of the fire , Dick leave the den , and rejoin the old outlaw , who stand await him under the leafless oak , and be already begin to be powder by the fall snow .
Each look upon the other , and each laugh , so thorough and so droll be the disguise .
`` Yet I would it be but summer and a clear day , '' grumble the outlaw , `` that I might see myself in the mirror of a pool .
There be many of Sir Daniel 's men that know me ; and if we fell to be recognise , there might be two word for you , brother , but a for me , in a paternoster while , I should be kick in a rope 's - end . ''
Thus they set forth together along the road to Shoreby , which , in this part of it course , keep near along the margin or the forest , come forth , from time to time , in the open country , and pass beside poor folk ' house and small farm .
Presently at sight of one of these , Lawless pull up .
`` Brother Martin , '' he say , in a voice capitally disguise , and suit to his monkish robe , `` let u enter and seek alms from these poor sinner .
Pax vobiscum !
Ay , '' he add , in his own voice , '' 't be a I fear ; I have somewhat lose the whine of it ; and by your leave , good Master Shelton , ye must suffer me to practise in these country place , before that I risk my fat neck by enter Sir Daniel 's .
But look ye a little , what an excellent thing it be to be a Jack-of-all-trades !
An I have not be a shipman , ye have infallibly go down in the Good Hope ; an I have not be a thief , I could not have paint me your face ; and but that I have be a Grey Friar , and sung loud in the choir , and eat hearty at the board , I could not have carry this disguise , but the very dog would have spy u out and bark at u for sham . ''
He be by this time close to the window of the farm , and he rise on his tip-toes and peep in .
`` Nay , '' he cry , `` good and well .
We shall here try our false face with a vengeance , and have a merry jest on Brother Capper to boot . ''
And so saying , he open the door and lead the way into the house .
Three of their own company sit at the table , greedily eat .
Their dagger , stick beside them in the board , and the black and menace look which they continue to shower upon the people of the house , prove that they owe their entertainment rather to force than favour .
On the two monk , who now , with a sort of humble dignity , enter the kitchen of the farm , they seem to turn with a particular resentment ; and one -- it be John Capper in person -- who seem to play the lead part , instantly and rudely order them away .
`` We want no beggar here ! ''
he cry .
But another -- although he be a far from recognise Dick and Lawless -- incline to more moderate counsel .
`` Not so , '' he cry .
`` We be strong men , and take ; these be weak , and crave ; but in the latter end these shall be uppermost and we below .
Mind him not , my father ; but come , drink of my cup , and give me a benediction . ''
`` Y ' be men of a light mind , carnal , and accurse , '' say the monk .
`` Now , may the saint forbid that ever I should drink with such companion !
But here , for the pity I bear to sinner , here I do leave you a bless relic , the which , for your soul 's interest , I bid you kiss and cherish . ''
So far Lawless thunder upon them like a preaching friar ; but with these word he draw from under his robe a black arrow , toss it on the board in front of the three startle outlaw , turn in the same instant , and , take Dick along with him , be out of the room and out of sight among the fall snow before they have time to utter a word or move a finger .
`` So , '' he say , `` we have prove our false face , Master Shelton .
I will now adventure my poor carcase where ye please . ''
`` Good ! ''
return Richard .
`` It irk me to be do .
Set we on for Shoreby ! ''
CHAPTER II -- `` IN MINE ENEMIES ' HOUSE '' Sir Daniel 's residence in Shoreby be a tall , commodious , plastered mansion , frame in carven oak , and cover by a low-pitched roof of thatch .
To the back there stretch a garden , full of fruit-trees , alley , and thick arbour , and overlook from the far end by the tower of the abbey church .
The house might contain , upon a pinch , the retinue of a great person than Sir Daniel ; but even now it be fill with hubbub .
The court rang with arm and horseshoe-iron ; the kitchen roar with cookery like a bee ' - hive ; minstrel , and the player of instrument , and the cry of tumbler , sound from the hall .
Sir Daniel , in his profusion , in the gaiety and gallantry of his establishment , rival with Lord Shoreby , and eclipse Lord Risingham .
All guest be make welcome .
Minstrels , tumbler , player of chess , the seller of relic , medicine , perfume , and enchantment , and along with these every sort of priest , friar , or pilgrim , be make welcome to the low table , and sleep together in the ample loft , or on the bare board of the long dining-hall .
On the afternoon follow the wreck of the Good Hope , the buttery , the kitchen , the stable , the covered cartshed that surround two side of the court , be all crowd by idle people , partly belong to Sir Daniel 's establishment , and attire in his livery of murrey and blue , partly nondescript stranger attract to the town by greed , and receive by the knight through policy , and because it be the fashion of the time .
The snow , which still fell without interruption , the extreme chill of the air , and the approach of night , combine to keep them under shelter .
Wine , ale , and money be all plentiful ; many sprawl gamble in the straw of the barn , many be still drunken from the noontide meal .
To the eye of a modern it would have look like the sack of a city ; to the eye of a contemporary it be like any other rich and noble household at a festive season .
Two monk -- a young and an old -- have arrive late , and be now warm themselves at a bonfire in a corner of the shed .
A mixed crowd surround them -- juggler , mountebank , and soldier ; and with these the elder of the two have soon engage so brisk a conversation , and exchange so many loud guffaw and country witticism , that the group momentarily increase in number .
The young companion , in whom the reader have already recognise Dick Shelton , sit from the first somewhat backward , and gradually draw himself away .
He listen , indeed , closely , but he open not his mouth ; and by the grave expression of his countenance , he make but little account of his companion 's pleasantry .
At last his eye , which travel continually to and fro , and keep a guard upon all the entrance of the house , light upon a little procession enter by the main gate and cross the court in an oblique direction .
Two lady , muffle in thick fur , lead the way , and be follow by a pair of waiting-women and four stout man-at-arms .
The next moment they have disappear within the house ; and Dick , slip through the crowd of loiterer in the shed , be already give hot pursuit .
`` The taller of these twain be Lady Brackley , '' he think ; `` and where Lady Brackley be , Joan will not be far . ''
At the door of the house the four man-at-arms have cease to follow , and the lady be now mount the stairway of polished oak , under no good escort than that of the two waiting-women .
Dick follow close behind .
It be already the dusk of the day ; and in the house the darkness of the night have almost come .
On the stair-landings , torch flare in iron holder ; down the long , tapestried corridor , a lamp burn by every door .
And where the door stand open , Dick could look in upon arras-covered wall and rush-bescattered floor , glow in the light of the wood fire .
Two floor be pass , and at every land the young and short of the two lady have look back keenly at the monk .
He , keep his eye lower , and affect the demure manner that suit his disguise , have but see her once , and be unaware that he have attract her attention .
And now , on the third floor , the party separate , the young lady continue to ascend alone , the other , follow by the waiting-maids , descend the corridor to the right .
Dick mount with a swift foot , and hold to the corner , thrust forth his head and follow the three woman with his eye .
Without turn or look behind them , they continue to descend the corridor .
`` It be right well , '' think Dick .
`` Let me but know my Lady Brackley 's chamber , and it will go hard an I find not Dame Hatch upon an errand . ''
And just then a hand be lay upon his shoulder , and , with a bound and a choked cry , he turn to grapple his assailant .
He be somewhat abashed to find , in the person whom he have so roughly seize , the short young lady in the fur .
She , on her part , be shock and terrify beyond expression , and hung trembling in his grasp .
`` Madam , '' say Dick , release her , `` I cry you a thousand pardon ; but I have no eye behind , and , by the mass , I could not tell ye be a maid . ''
The girl continue to look at him , but , by this time , terror begin to be succeed by surprise , and surprise by suspicion .
Dick , who could read these change on her face , become alarm for his own safety in that hostile house .
`` Fair maid , '' he say , affect easiness , `` suffer me to kiss your hand , in token ye forgive my roughness , and I will even go . ''
`` Y ' be a strange monk , young sir , '' return the young lady , look him both boldly and shrewdly in the face ; `` and now that my first astonishment hath somewhat pass away , I can spy the layman in each word you utter .
What do ye here ?
Why be ye thus sacrilegiously trick out ?
Come ye in peace or war ?
And why spy ye after Lady Brackley like a thief ? ''
`` Madam , '' quoth Dick , `` of one thing I pray you to be very sure : I be no thief .
And even if I come here in war , a in some degree I do , I make no war upon fair maid , and I hereby entreat them to copy me so far , and to leave me be .
For , indeed , fair mistress , cry out -- if such be your pleasure -- cry but once , and say what ye have see , and the poor gentleman before you be merely a dead man .
I can not think ye would be cruel , '' add Dick ; and take the girl 's hand gently in both of his , he look at her with courteous admiration .
`` Are ye , then , a spy -- a Yorkist ? ''
ask the maid .
`` Madam , '' he reply , `` I be indeed a Yorkist , and , in some sort , a spy .
But that which bringeth me into this house , the same which will win for me the pity and interest of your kind heart , be neither of York nor Lancaster .
I will wholly put my life in your discretion .
I be a lover , and my name -- '' But here the young lady clap her hand suddenly upon Dick 's mouth , look hastily up and down and east and west , and , see the coast clear , begin to drag the young man , with great strength and vehemence , up-stairs .
`` Hush ! ''
she say , `` and come !
Shalt talk hereafter . ''
Somewhat bewilder , Dick suffer himself to be pull up-stairs , bustle along a corridor , and thrust suddenly into a chamber , lit , like so many of the others , by a blazing log upon the hearth .
`` Now , '' say the young lady , force him down upon a stool , `` sit ye there and attend my sovereign good pleasure .
I have life and death over you , and I will not scruple to abuse my power .
Look to yourself ; y ' ` ave cruelly maul my arm .
He know not I be a maid , quoth he !
Had he know I be a maid , he have ta'en his belt to me , forsooth ! ''
And with these word , she whip out of the room and leave Dick gap with wonder , and not very sure if he be dream or awake .
`` Ta'en my belt to her ! ''
he repeat .
`` Ta'en my belt to her ! ''
And the recollection of that evening in the forest flow back upon his mind , and he once more saw Matcham 's wince body and beseeching eye .
And then he be recall to the danger of the present .
In the next room he hear a stir , a of a person move ; then follow a sigh , which sound strangely near ; and then the rustle of skirt and tap of foot once more begin .
As he stand hearkening , he saw the arras wave along the wall ; there be the sound of a door be open , the hanging divide , and , lamp in hand , Joanna Sedley enter the apartment .
She be attire in costly stuff of deep and warm colour , such a befit the winter and the snow .
Upon her head , her hair have be gather together and become her a a crown .
And she , who have seem so little and so awkward in the attire of Matcham , be now tall like a young willow , and swam across the floor a though she scorn the drudgery of walking .
Without a start , without a tremor , she raise her lamp and look at the young monk .
`` What make ye here , good brother ? ''
she inquire .
`` Ye be doubtless ill-directed .
Whom do ye require ?
And she set her lamp upon the bracket .
`` Joanna , '' say Dick ; and then his voice fail him .
`` Joanna , '' he begin again , `` ye say ye love me ; and the more fool I , but I believe it ! ''
`` Dick ! ''
she cry .
`` Dick ! ''
And then , to the wonder of the lad , this beautiful and tall young lady make but one step of it , and throw her arm about his neck and give him a hundred kiss all in one .
`` Oh , the fool fellow ! ''
she cry .
`` Oh , dear Dick !
Oh , if ye could see yourself !
Alack ! ''
she add , pause .
`` I have spoil you , Dick !
I have knock some of the paint off .
But that can be mend .
What can not be mend , Dick -- or I much fear it can not !
-- be my marriage with Lord Shoreby . ''
`` Is it decide , then ? ''
ask the lad .
`` To-morrow , before noon , Dick , in the abbey church , '' she answer , `` John Matcham and Joanna Sedley both shall come to a right miserable end .
There be no help in tear , or I could weep mine eye out .
I have not spar myself to pray , but Heaven frown on my petition .
And , dear Dick -- good Dick -- but that ye can get me forth of this house before the morning , we must even kiss and say good-bye . ''
`` Nay , '' say Dick , `` not I ; I will never say that word .
'T be like despair ; but while there 's life , Joanna , there be hope .
Yet will I hope .
Ay , by the mass , and triumph !
Look ye , now , when ye be but a name to me , do I not follow -- do I not rouse good men -- do I not stake my life upon the quarrel ?
And now that I have see you for what ye be -- the fair maid and stateliest of England -- think ye I would turn ?
-- if the deep sea be there , I would straight through it ; if the way be full of lion , I would scatter them like mouse . ''
`` Ay , '' she say , dryly , `` ye make a great ado about a sky-blue robe ! ''
`` Nay , Joan , '' protest Dick , '' 't be not alone the robe .
But , lass , ye be disguise .
Here be I disguise ; and , to the proof , do I not cut a figure of fun -- a right fool 's figure ? ''
`` Ay , Dick , an ' that ye do ! ''
she answer , smile .
`` Well , then ! ''
he return , triumphant .
`` So be it with you , poor Matcham , in the forest .
In sooth , ye be a wench to laugh at .
But now ! ''
So they run on , hold each other by both hand , exchange smile and lovely look , and melt minute into second ; and so they might have continue all night long .
But presently there be a noise behind them ; and they be aware of the short young lady , with her finger on her lip .
`` Saints ! ''
she cry , `` but what a noise ye keep !
Can ye not speak in compass ?
And now , Joanna , my fair maid of the wood , what will ye give your gossip for bring you your sweetheart ? ''
Joanna run to her , by way of answer , and embrace her fierily .
`` And you , sir , '' add the young lady , `` what do ye give me ? ''
`` Madam , '' say Dick , `` I would fain offer to pay you in the same money . ''
`` Come , then , '' say the lady , `` it be permit you . ''
But Dick , blush like a peony , only kiss her hand .
`` What ail ye at my face , fair sir ? ''
she inquire , curtsey to the very ground ; and then , when Dick have at length and most tepidly embrace her , `` Joanna , '' she add , `` your sweetheart be very backward under your eye ; but I warrant you , when first we meet he be more ready .
I be all black and blue , wench ; trust me never , if I be not black and blue !
And now , '' she continue , `` have ye say your saying ?
for I must speedily dismiss the paladin . ''
But at this they both cry out that they have say nothing , that the night be still very young , and that they would not be separate so early .
`` And supper ? ''
ask the young lady .
`` Must we not go down to supper ? ''
`` Nay , to be sure ! ''
cried Joan .
`` I have forget . ''
`` Hide me , then , '' say Dick , `` put me behind the arras , shut me in a chest , or what ye will , so that I may be here on your return .
Indeed , fair lady , '' he add , `` bear this in mind , that we be sore best , and may never look upon each other 's face from this night forward till we die . ''
At this the young lady melt ; and when , a little after , the bell summon Sir Daniel 's household to the board , Dick be plant very stiffly against the wall , at a place where a division in the tapestry permit him to breathe the more freely , and even to see into the room .
He have not be long in this position , when he be somewhat strangely disturbed .
The silence , in that upper storey of the house , be only break by the flickering of the flame and the hissing of a green log in the chimney ; but presently , to Dick 's strained hearing , there come the sound of some one walking with extreme precaution ; and soon after the door open , and a little black-faced , dwarfish fellow , in Lord Shoreby 's colour , push first his head , and then his crooked body , into the chamber .
His mouth be open , a though to hear the good ; and his eye , which be very bright , flit restlessly and swiftly to and fro .
He go round and round the room , strike here and there upon the hanging ; but Dick , by a miracle , escape his notice .
Then he look below the furniture , and examine the lamp ; and , at last , with an air of cruel disappointment , be prepare to go away as silently a he have come , when down he drop upon his knee , pick up something from among the rush on the floor , examine it , and , with every signal of delight , conceal it in the wallet at his belt .
Dick 's heart sank , for the object in question be a tassel from his own girdle ; and it be plain to him that this dwarfish spy , who take a malign delight in his employment , would lose no time in bear it to his master , the baron .
He be half-tempted to throw aside the arras , fall upon the scoundrel , and , at the risk of his life , remove the telltale token .
And while he be still hesitate , a new cause of concern be add .
A voice , hoarse and break by drink , begin to be audible from the stair ; and presently after , uneven , wander , and heavy footstep sound without along the passage .
`` What make ye here , my merry men , among the greenwood shaw ? ''
sing the voice .
`` What make ye here ?
Hey !
sot , what make ye here ? ''
it add , with a rattle of drunken laughter ; and then , once more breaking into song : `` If ye should drink the clary wine , Fat Friar John , ye friend o ' mine -- If I should eat , and ye should drink , Who shall sing the mass , d 'ye think ? ''
Lawless , ala !
roll drunk , be wander the house , seek for a corner wherein to slumber off the effect of his potation .
Dick inwardly rag .
The spy , at first terrify , have grow reassure a he find he have to deal with an intoxicated man , and now , with a movement of cat-like rapidity , slip from the chamber , and be go from Richard 's eye .
What be to be do ?
If he lose touch of Lawless for the night , he be leave impotent , whether to plan or carry forth Joanna 's rescue .
If , on the other hand , he dare to address the drunken outlaw , the spy might still be linger within sight , and the most fatal consequence ensue .
It be , nevertheless , upon this last hazard that Dick decide .
Slipping from behind the tapestry , he stand ready in the doorway of the chamber , with a warning hand upraise .
Lawless , flush crimson , with his eye inject , vacillate on his foot , draw still unsteadily nearer .
At last he hazily catch sight of his commander , and , in despite of Dick 's imperious signal , hail him instantly and loudly by his name .
Dick leap upon and shake the drunkard furiously .
`` Beast ! ''
he hiss -- `` beast and no man !
It be bad than treachery to be so witless .
We may all be shent for thy sotting . ''
But Lawless only laugh and stagger , and try to clap young Shelton on the back .
And just then Dick 's quick ear catch a rapid brushing in the arras .
He leap towards the sound , and the next moment a piece of the wall-hanging have be tear down , and Dick and the spy be sprawl together in it fold .
Over and over they roll , grapple for each other 's throat , and still baffle by the arras , and still silent in their deadly fury .
But Dick be by much the strong , and soon the spy lay prostrate under his knee , and , with a single stroke of the long poniard , cease to breathe .
CHAPTER III -- THE DEAD SPY Throughout this furious and rapid passage , Lawless have look on helplessly , and even when all be over , and Dick , already re-arisen to his foot , be listen with the most passionate attention to the distant bustle in the low storey of the house , the old outlaw be still waver on his leg like a shrub in a breeze of wind , and still stupidly star on the face of the dead man .
`` It be well , '' say Dick , at length ; `` they have not hear u , praise the saint !
But , now , what shall I do with this poor spy ?
At least , I will take my tassel from his wallet . ''
So say , Dick open the wallet ; within he find a few piece of money , the tassel , and a letter address to Lord Wensleydale , and seal with my Lord Shoreby 's seal .
The name awake Dick 's recollection ; and he instantly break the wax and read the content of the letter .
It be short , but , to Dick 's delight , it give evident proof that Lord Shoreby be treacherously correspond with the House of York .
The young fellow usually carry his ink-horn and implement about him , and so now , bend a knee beside the body of the dead spy , he be able to write these word upon a corner of the paper : My Lord of Shoreby , ye that writt the letter , wot ye why your man be ded ?
But let me rede you , marry not .
JON AMEND-ALL .
He lay this paper on the breast of the corpse ; and then Lawless , who have be look on upon these last manoeuvre with some flicker return of intelligence , suddenly draw a black arrow from below his robe , and therewith pin the paper in it place .
The sight of this disrespect , or , a it almost seem , cruelty to the dead , draw a cry of horror from young Shelton ; but the old outlaw only laugh .
`` Nay , I will have the credit for mine order , '' he hiccup .
`` My jolly boys must have the credit o n't -- the credit , brother ; '' and then , shut his eye tight and open his mouth like a precentor , he begin to thunder , in a formidable voice : `` If ye should drink the clary wine '' -- `` Peace , sot ! ''
cry Dick , and thrust him hard against the wall .
`` In two word -- if so be that such a man can understand me who hath more wine than wit in him -- in two word , and , a-Mary 's name , begone out of this house , where , if ye continue to abide , ye will not only hang yourself , but me also !
Faith , then , up foot !
be yare , or , by the mass , I may forget that I be in some sort your captain and in some your debtor !
Go ! ''
The sham monk be now , in some degree , recover the use of his intelligence ; and the ring in Dick 's voice , and the glitter in Dick 's eye , stamp home the meaning of his word .
`` By the mass , '' cry Lawless , `` an I be not want , I can go ; '' and he turn tipsily along the corridor and proceed to flounder down-stairs , lurch against the wall .
So soon a he be out of sight , Dick return to his hiding-place , resolutely fix to see the matter out .
Wisdom , indeed , move him to be go ; but love and curiosity be strong .
Time pass slowly for the young man , bolt upright behind the arras .
The fire in the room begin to die down , and the lamp to burn low and to smoke .
And still there be no word of the return of any one to these upper quarter of the house ; still the faint hum and clatter of the supper party sound from far below ; and still , under the thick fall of the snow , Shoreby town lay silent upon every side .
At length , however , foot and voice begin to draw near upon the stair ; and presently after several of Sir Daniel 's guest arrive upon the landing , and , turn down the corridor , behold the torn arras and the body of the spy .
Some run forward and some back , and all together begin to cry aloud .
At the sound of their cry , guest , man-at-arms , lady , servant , and , in a word , all the inhabitant of that great house , come fly from every direction , and begin to join their voice to the tumult .
Soon a way be clear , and Sir Daniel come forth in person , follow by the bridegroom of the morrow , my Lord Shoreby .
`` My lord , '' say Sir Daniel , `` have I not tell you of this knave Black Arrow ?
To the proof , behold it !
There it stand , and , by the rood , my gossip , in a man of yours , or one that steal your colour ! ''
`` In good sooth , it be a man of mine , '' reply Lord Shoreby , hang back .
`` I would I have more such .
He be keen a a beagle and secret a a mole . ''
`` Ay , gossip , truly ? ''
ask Sir Daniel , keenly .
`` And what come he smell up so many stair in my poor mansion ?
But he will smell no more . ''
`` A n't please you , Sir Daniel , '' say one , `` here be a paper write upon with some matter , pin upon his breast . ''
`` Give it me , arrow and all , '' say the knight .
And when he have take into his hand the shaft , he continue for some time to gaze upon it in a sullen musing .
`` Ay , '' he say , address Lord Shoreby , `` here be a hate that followeth hard and close upon my heel .
This black stick , or it just likeness , shall yet bring me down .
And , gossip , suffer a plain knight to counsel you ; and if these hound begin to wind you , flee !
'T be like a sickness -- it still hangeth , hangeth upon the limb .
But let u see what they have write .
It be a I think , my lord ; y ' be mark , like an old oak , by the woodman ; to-morrow or next day , by will come the axe .
But what write ye in a letter ? ''
Lord Shoreby snatch the paper from the arrow , read it , crumple it between his hand , and , overcome the reluctance which have hitherto withhold him from approach , throw himself on his knee beside the body and eagerly grope in the wallet .
He rise to his foot with a somewhat unsettled countenance .
`` Gossip , '' he say , `` I have indeed lose a letter here that much import ; and could I lay my hand upon the knave that take it , he should incontinently grace a halter .
But let u , first of all , secure the issue of the house .
Here be enough harm already , by St. George ! ''
Sentinels be post close around the house and garden ; a sentinel on every landing of the stair , a whole troop in the main entrance-hall ; and yet another about the bonfire in the shed .
Sir Daniel 's follower be supplement by Lord Shoreby 's ; there be thus no lack of men or weapon to make the house secure , or to entrap a lurking enemy , should one be there .
Meanwhile , the body of the spy be carry out through the fall snow and deposit in the abbey church .
It be not until these disposition have be take , and all have return to a decorous silence , that the two girl draw Richard Shelton from his place of concealment , and make a full report to him of what have pass .
He , upon his side , recount the visit of the spy , his dangerous discovery , and speedy end .
Joanna lean back very faint against the curtained wall .
`` It will avail but little , '' she say .
`` I shall be wed to-morrow , in the morning , after all ! ''
`` What ! ''
cry her friend .
`` And here be our paladin that driveth lion like mouse !
Ye have little faith , of a surety .
But come , friend lion-driver , give u some comfort ; speak , and let u hear bold counsel . ''
Dick be confound to be thus outface with his own exaggerated word ; but though he colour , he still speak stoutly .
`` Truly , '' say he , `` we be in strait .
Yet , could I but win out of this house for half an hour , I do honestly tell myself that all might still go well ; and for the marriage , it should be prevent . ''
`` And for the lion , '' mimic the girl , `` they shall be drive . ''
`` I crave your excuse , '' say Dick .
`` I speak not now in any boasting humour , but rather a one inquiring after help or counsel ; for if I get not forth of this house and through these sentinel , I can do less than naught .
Take me , I pray you , rightly . ''
`` Why say ye he be rustic , Joan ? ''
the girl inquire .
`` I warrant he hath a tongue in his head ; ready , soft , and bold be his speech at pleasure .
What would ye more ? ''
`` Nay , '' sigh Joanna , with a smile , `` they have change me my friend Dick , 't be sure enough .
When I behold him , he be rough indeed .
But it matter little ; there be no help for my hard case , and I must still be Lady Shoreby ! ''
`` Nay , then , '' say Dick , `` I will even make the adventure .
A friar be not much regard ; and if I find a good fairy to lead me up , I may find another belike to carry me down .
How call they the name of this spy ? ''
`` Rutter , '' say the young lady ; `` and an excellent good name to call him by .
But how mean ye , lion-driver ?
What be in your mind to do ? ''
`` To offer boldly to go forth , '' return Dick ; `` and if any stop me , to keep an unchanged countenance , and say I go to pray for Rutter .
They will be pray over his poor clay even now . ''
`` The device be somewhat simple , '' reply the girl , `` yet it may hold . ''
`` Nay , '' say young Shelton , `` it be no device , but mere boldness , which serveth often well in great strait . ''
`` Ye say true , '' she say .
`` Well , go , a-Mary 's name , and may Heaven speed you !
Ye leave here a poor maid that love you entirely , and another that be most heartily your friend .
Be wary , for their sake , and make not shipwreck of your safety . ''
`` Ay , '' add Joanna , `` go , Dick .
Ye run no more peril , whether ye go or stay .
Go ; ye take my heart with you ; the saint defend you ! ''
Dick pass the first sentry with so assure a countenance that the fellow merely figeted and star ; but at the second land the man carry his spear across and bid him name his business . ''
Pax vobiscum , '' answer Dick .
`` I go to pray over the body of this poor Rutter . ''
`` Like enough , '' return the sentry ; `` but to go alone be not permit you . ''
He lean over the oaken baluster and whistle shrill .
`` One cometh ! ''
he cry ; and then motion Dick to pass .
At the foot of the stair he find the guard afoot and await his arrival ; and when he have once more repeated his story , the commander of the post order four men out to accompany him to the church .
`` Let him not slip , my lad , '' he say .
`` Bring him to Sir Oliver , on your life ! ''
The door be then open ; one of the men take Dick by either arm , another march ahead with a link , and the fourth , with bent bow and the arrow on the string , bring up the rear .
In this order they proceed through the garden , under the thick darkness of the night and the scattering snow , and draw near to the dimly-illuminated window of the abbey church .
At the western portal a picket of archer stand , take what shelter they could find in the hollow of the arched doorway , and all powder with the snow ; and it be not until Dick 's conductor have exchange a word with these , that they be suffer to pass forth and enter the nave of the sacred edifice .
The church be doubtfully light by the taper upon the great altar , and by a lamp or two that swing from the arch roof before the private chapel of illustrious family .
In the midst of the choir the dead spy lay , his limb piously compose , upon a bier .
A hurried mutter of prayer sound along the arch ; cowl figure kneel in the stall of the choir , and on the step of the high altar a priest in pontifical vestment celebrate mass .
Upon this fresh entrance , one of the cowled figure arise , and , come down the step which elevate the level of the choir above that of the nave , demand from the leader of the four men what business bring him to the church .
Out of respect for the service and the dead , they speak in guarded tone ; but the echo of that huge , empty building catch up their word , and hollowly repeat and repeat them along the aisle .
`` A monk ! ''
return Sir Oliver -LRB- for he it be -RRB- , when he have hear the report of the archer .
`` My brother , I look not for your coming , '' he add , turn to young Shelton .
`` In all civility , who be ye ?
and at whose instance do ye join your supplication to ours ? ''
Dick , keep his cowl about his face , sign to Sir Oliver to move a pace or two aside from the archer ; and , so soon a the priest have do so , `` I can not hope to deceive you , sir , '' he say .
`` My life be in your hand . ''
Sir Oliver violently start ; his stout cheek grow pale , and for a space he be silent .
`` Richard , '' he say , `` what bring you here , I know not ; but I much misdoubt it to be evil .
Nevertheless , for the kindness that be , I would not willingly deliver you to harm .
Ye shall sit all night beside me in the stall : ye shall sit there till my Lord of Shoreby be marry , and the party go safe home ; and if all goeth well , and ye have plan no evil , in the end ye shall go whither ye will .
But if your purpose be bloody , it shall return upon your head .
Amen ! ''
And the priest devoutly cross himself , and turn and louted to the altar .
With that , he speak a few word more to the soldier , and take Dick by the hand , lead him up to the choir , and place him in the stall beside his own , where , for mere decency , the lad have instantly to kneel and appear to be busy with his devotion .
His mind and his eye , however , be continually wander .
Three of the soldier , he observe , instead of return to the house , have get them quietly into a point of vantage in the aisle ; and he could not doubt that they have do so by Sir Oliver 's command .
Here , then , he be trap .
Here he must spend the night in the ghostly glimmer and shadow of the church , and look on the pale face of him he slew ; and here , in the morning , he must see his sweetheart marry to another man before his eye .
But , for all that , he obtain a command upon his mind , and build himself up in patience to await the issue .
CHAPTER IV -- IN THE ABBEY CHURCH In Shoreby Abbey Church the prayer be keep up all night without cessation , now with the singing of psalm , now with a note or two upon the bell .
Rutter , the spy , be nobly wake .
There he lay , meanwhile , a they have arrange him , his dead hand cross upon his bosom , his dead eye star on the roof ; and hard by , in the stall , the lad who have slay him wait , in sore disquietude , the come of the morning .
Once only , in the course of the hour , Sir Oliver lean across to his captive .
`` Richard , '' he whisper , `` my son , if ye mean me evil , I will certify , on my soul 's welfare , ye design upon an innocent man .
Sinful in the eye of Heaven I do declare myself ; but sinful a against you I be not , neither have be ever . ''
`` My father , '' return Dick , in the same tone of voice , `` trust me , I design nothing ; but a for your innocence , I may not forget that ye clear yourself but lamely . ''
`` A man may be innocently guilty , '' reply the priest .
`` He may be set blindfold upon a mission , ignorant of it true scope .
So it be with me .
I do decoy your father to his death ; but a Heaven see u in this sacred place , I know not what I do . ''
`` It may be , '' return Dick .
`` But see what a strange web ye have weave , that I should be , at this hour , at once your prisoner and your judge ; that ye should both threaten my day and deprecate my anger .
Methinks , if ye have be all your life a true man and good priest , ye would neither thus fear nor thus detest me .
And now to your prayer .
I do obey you , since need must ; but I will not be burthen with your company . ''
The priest utter a sigh so heavy that it have almost touch the lad into some sentiment of pity , and he bow his head upon his hand like a man bear down below a weight of care .
He join no longer in the psalm ; but Dick could hear the bead rattle through his finger and the prayer a-pattering between his teeth .
Yet a little , and the grey of the morning begin to struggle through the painted casement of the church , and to put to shame the glimmer of the taper .
The light slowly broaden and brighten , and presently through the south-eastern clerestory a flush of rosy sunlight flicker on the wall .
The storm be over ; the great cloud have disburden their snow and flee farther on , and the new day be break on a merry winter landscape sheathe in white .
A bustle of church officer follow ; the bier be carry forth to the deadhouse , and the stain of blood be cleanse from off the tile , that no such ill-omened spectacle should disgrace the marriage of Lord Shoreby .
At the same time , the very ecclesiastic who have be so dismally engage all night begin to put on morning face , to do honour to the merrier ceremony which be about to follow .
And far to announce the come of the day , the pious of the town begin to assemble and fall to prayer before their favourite shrine , or wait their turn at the confessional .
Favoured by this stir , it be of course easily possible for any man to avoid the vigilance of Sir Daniel 's sentry at the door ; and presently Dick , look about him wearily , catch the eye of no less a person than Will Lawless , still in his monk 's habit .
The outlaw , at the same moment , recognise his leader , and privily sign to him with hand and eye .
Now , Dick be far from have forgive the old rogue his most untimely drunkenness , but he have no desire to involve him in his own predicament ; and he signal back to him , as plain a he be able , to begone .
Lawless , a though he have understood , disappear at once behind a pillar , and Dick breathe again .
What , then , be his dismay to feel himself pluck by the sleeve and to find the old robber instal beside him , upon the next seat , and , to all appearance , plunge in his devotion !
Instantly Sir Oliver arise from his place , and , glide behind the stall , make for the soldier in the aisle .
If the priest 's suspicion have be so lightly waken , the harm be already do , and Lawless a prisoner in the church .
`` Move not , '' whisper Dick .
`` We be in the plaguiest pas , thanks , before all thing , to thy swinishness of yestereven .
When ye saw me here , so strangely seat where I have neither right nor interest , what a murrain I could ye not smell harm and get ye go from evil ? ''
`` Nay , '' return Lawless , `` I think ye have hear from Ellis , and be here on duty . ''
`` Ellis ! ''
echoed Dick .
`` Is Ellis , then , return ?
`` For sure , '' reply the outlaw .
`` He come last night , and belt me sore for be in wine -- so there ye be avenge , my master .
A furious man be Ellis Duckworth !
He hath ride me hot-spur from Craven to prevent this marriage ; and , Master Dick , ye know the way of him -- do so he will ! ''
`` Nay , then , '' return Dick , with composure , `` you and I , my poor brother , be dead men ; for I sit here a prisoner upon suspicion , and my neck be to answer for this very marriage that he purposeth to mar . .
I have a fair choice , by the rood !
to lose my sweetheart or else lose my life !
Well , the cast be throw -- it be to be my life . ''
`` By the mass , '' cry Lawless , half arising , `` I be go ! ''
But Dick have his hand at once upon his shoulder .
`` Friend Lawless , sit ye still , '' he say .
`` An ye have eye , look yonder at the corner by the chancel arch ; see ye not that , even upon the motion of your rising , yon arm men be up and ready to intercept you ?
Yield ye , friend .
Ye be bold aboard ship , when ye think to die a sea-death ; be bold again , now that y ' be to die presently upon the gallows . ''
`` Master Dick , '' gasp Lawless , `` the thing hath come upon me somewhat of the sudden .
But give me a moment till I fetch my breath again ; and , by the mass , I will be as stout-hearted a yourself . ''
`` Here be my bold fellow ! ''
return Dick .
`` And yet , Lawless , it go hard against the grain with me to die ; but where whine mendeth nothing , wherefore whine ? ''
`` Nay , that indeed ! ''
chime Lawless .
`` And a fig for death , at bad !
It have to be do , my master , soon or late .
And hang in a good quarrel be an easy death , they say , though I could never hear of any that come back to say so . ''
And so saying , the stout old rascal lean back in his stall , fold his arm , and begin to look about him with the great air of insolence and unconcern .
`` And for the matter of that , '' Dick add , `` it be yet our best chance to keep quiet .
We wot not yet what Duckworth purpose ; and when all be say , and if the bad befall , we may yet clear our foot of it . ''
Now that they cease talk , they be aware of a very distant and thin strain of mirthful music which steadily draw nearer , louder , and merry .
The bell in the tower begin to break forth into a double peal , and a great and great concourse of people to crowd into the church , shuffle the snow from off their foot , and clap and blow in their hand .
The western door be flung wide open , show a glimpse of sunlit , snowy street , and admit in a great gust the shrewd air of the morning ; and in short , it become plain by every sign that Lord Shoreby desire to be marry very early in the day , and that the wedding-train be draw near .
Some of Lord Shoreby 's men now clear a passage down the middle aisle , force the people back with lance-stocks ; and just then , outside the portal , the secular musician could be descry draw near over the frozen snow , the fifers and trumpeter scarlet in the face with lusty blowing , the drummer and the cymbalist beating a for a wager .
These , a they draw near the door of the sacred building , file off on either side , and , mark time to their own vigorous music , stand stamp in the snow .
As they thus open their rank , the leader of this noble bridal train appear behind and between them ; and such be the variety and gaiety of their attire , such the display of silk and velvet , fur and satin , embroidery and lace , that the procession show forth upon the snow like a flower-bed in a path or a paint window in a wall .
First come the bride , a sorry sight , as pale a winter , cling to Sir Daniel 's arm , and attend , a brides-maid , by the short young lady who have befriend Dick the night before .
Close behind , in the most radiant toilet , follow the bridegroom , halt on a gouty foot ; and a he pass the threshold of the sacred building and doff his hat , his bald head be see to be rosy with emotion .
And now come the hour of Ellis Duckworth .
Dick , who sit stun among contrary emotion , grasp the desk in front of him , behold a movement in the crowd , people jostle backward , and eye and arm uplift .
Following these sign , he behold three or four men with bent bow lean from the clerestory gallery .
At the same instant they deliver their discharge , and before the clamour and cry of the astounded populace have time to swell fully upon the ear , they have flit from their perch and disappear .
The nave be full of sway head and voice scream ; the ecclesiastic throng in terror from their place ; the music cease , and though the bell overhead continue for some second to clang upon the air , some wind of the disaster seem to find it way at last even to the chamber where the ringer be leap on their rope , and they also desist from their merry labour .
Right in the midst of the nave the bridegroom lay stone-dead , pierce by two black arrow .
The bride have faint .
Sir Daniel stand , tower above the crowd in his surprise and anger , a clothyard shaft quiver in his left forearm , and his face stream blood from another which have graze his brow .
Long before any search could be make for them , the author of this tragic interruption have clatter down a turnpike stair and decamp by a postern door .
But Dick and Lawless still remain in pawn ; they have , indeed , arisen on the first alarm , and push manfully to gain the door ; but what with the narrowness of the stall and the crowding of terrified priest and chorister , the attempt have be in vain , and they have stoically resume their place .
And now , pale with horror , Sir Oliver rise to his foot and call upon Sir Daniel , point with one hand to Dick .
`` Here , '' he cry , `` be Richard Shelton -- alas the hour !
-- blood guilty !
Seize him !
-- bid him be seize !
For all our life ' sake , take him and bind him surely !
He hath sworn our fall . ''
Sir Daniel be blind by anger -- blind by the hot blood that still stream across his face .
`` Where ? ''
he bellow .
`` Hale him forth !
By the cross of Holywood , but he shall rue this hour ! ''
The crowd fell back , and a party of archer invade the choir , lay rough hand on Dick , drag him head-foremost from the stall , and thrust him by the shoulder down the chancel step .
Lawless , on his part , sit as still a a mouse .
Sir Daniel , brush the blood out of his eye , star blinkingly upon his captive .
`` Ay , '' he say , `` treacherous and insolent , I have thee fast ; and by all potent oath , for every drop of blood that now trickle in mine eye , I will wring a groan out of thy carcase .
Away with him ! ''
he add .
`` Here be no place !
Off with him to my house .
I will number every joint of thy body with a torture . ''
But Dick , put off his captor , uplift his voice .
`` Sanctuary ! ''
he shout .
`` Sanctuary !
Ho , there , my father !
They would drag me from the church ! ''
`` From the church thou hast defile with murder , boy , '' add a tall man , magnificently dress .
`` On what probation ? ''
cry Dick .
`` They do accuse me , indeed , of some complicity , but have not prove one tittle .
I be , in truth , a suitor for this damsel 's hand ; and she , I will be bold to say it , repay my suit with favour .
But what then ?
To love a maid be no offence , I trow -- nay , nor to gain her love .
In all else , I stand here free from guiltiness . ''
There be a murmur of approval among the bystander , so boldly Dick declare his innocence ; but at the same time a throng of accuser arise upon the other side , cry how he have be find last night in Sir Daniel 's house , how he wear a sacrilegious disguise ; and in the midst of the babel , Sir Oliver indicate Lawless , both by voice and gesture , a accomplice to the fact .
He , in his turn , be drag from his seat and set beside his leader .
The feeling of the crowd rise high on either side , and while some drag the prisoner to and fro to favour their escape , others curse and strike them with their fist .
Dick 's ear rang and his brain swam dizzily , like a man struggle in the eddy of a furious river .
But the tall man who have already answer Dick , by a prodigious exercise of voice restore silence and order in the mob .
`` Search them , '' he say , `` for arm .
We may so judge of their intention . ''
Upon Dick they find no weapon but his poniard , and this told in his favour , until one man officiously draw it from it sheath , and find it still uncleansed of the blood of Rutter .
At this there be a great shout among Sir Daniel 's follower , which the tall man suppress by a gesture and an imperious glance .
But when it come to the turn of Lawless , there be find under his gown a sheaf of arrow identical with those that have be shoot .
`` How say ye now ? ''
ask the tall man , frowningly , of Dick .
`` Sir , '' reply Dick , `` I be here in sanctuary , be it not so ?
Well , sir , I see by your bearing that ye be high in station , and I read in your countenance the mark of piety and justice .
To you , then , I will yield me prisoner , and that blithely , forego the advantage of this holy place .
But rather than to be yield into the discretion of that man -- whom I do here accuse with a loud voice to be the murderer of my natural father and the unjust retainer of my land and revenue -- rather than that , I would beseech you , under favour , with your own gentle hand , to despatch me on the spot .
Your own ear have hear him , how before that I be proven guilty he do threaten me with torment .
It standeth not with your own honour to deliver me to my sworn enemy and old oppressor , but to try me fairly by the way of law , and , if that I be guilty indeed , to slay me mercifully . ''
`` My lord , '' cry Sir Daniel , `` ye will not hearken to this wolf ?
His bloody dagger reek him the lie into his face . ''
`` Nay , but suffer me , good knight , '' return the tall stranger ; `` your own vehemence doth somewhat tell against yourself . ''
And here the bride , who have come to herself some minute past and look wildly on upon this scene , break loose from those that hold her , and fell upon her knee before the last speaker .
`` My Lord of Risingham , '' she cry , `` hear me , in justice .
I be here in this man 's custody by mere force , reft from mine own people .
Since that day I have never pity , countenance , nor comfort from the face of man -- but from him only -- Richard Shelton -- whom they now accuse and labour to undo .
My lord , if he be yesternight in Sir Daniel 's mansion , it be I that bring him there ; he come but at my prayer , and think to do no hurt .
While yet Sir Daniel be a good lord to him , he fight with them of the Black Arrow loyally ; but when his foul guardian seek his life by practice , and he flee by night , for his soul 's sake , out of that bloody house , whither be he to turn -- he , helpless and penniless ?
Or if he be fall among ill company , whom should ye blame -- the lad that be unjustly handle , or the guardian that do abuse his trust ? ''
And then the short young lady fell on her knee by Joanna 's side .
`` And I , my good lord and natural uncle , '' she add , `` I can bear testimony , on my conscience and before the face of all , that what this maiden saith be true .
It be I , unworthy , that do lead the young man in . ''
Earl Risingham have hear in silence , and when the voice cease , he still stand silent for a space .
Then he give Joanna his hand to arise , though it be to be observe that he do not offer the like courtesy to her who have call herself his niece .
`` Sir Daniel , '' he say , `` here be a right intricate affair , the which , with your good leave , it shall be mine to examine and adjust .
Content ye , then ; your business be in careful hand ; justice shall be do you ; and in the meanwhile , get ye incontinently home , and have your hurt attend .
The air be shrewd , and I would not ye take cold upon these scratch . ''
He make a sign with his hand ; it be pass down the nave by obsequious servant , who wait there upon his small gesture .
Instantly , without the church , a tucket sound shrill , and through the open portal archer and man-at-arms , uniformly array in the colour and wear the badge of Lord Risingham , begin to file into the church , take Dick and Lawless from those who still detain them , and , close their file about the prisoner , march forth again and disappear .
As they be pass , Joanna hold both her hand to Dick and cry him her farewell ; and the bridesmaid , nothing downcast by her uncle 's evident displeasure , blow him a kiss , with a `` Keep your heart up , lion-driver ! ''
that for the first time since the accident call up a smile to the face of the crowd .
CHAPTER V -- EARL RISINGHAM Earl Risingham , although by far the most important person then in Shoreby , be poorly lodge in the house of a private gentleman upon the extreme outskirt of the town .
Nothing but the arm men at the door , and the mounted messenger that keep arrive and depart , announce the temporary residence of a great lord .
Thus it be that , from lack of space , Dick and Lawless be clap into the same apartment .
`` Well speak , Master Richard , '' say the outlaw ; `` it be excellently well speak , and , for my part , I thank you cordially .
Here we be in good hand ; we shall be justly try , and , some time this evening , decently hang on the same tree . ''
`` Indeed , my poor friend , I do believe it , '' answer Dick .
`` Yet have we a string to our bow , '' return Lawless .
`` Ellis Duckworth be a man out of ten thousand ; he holdeth you right near his heart , both for your own and for your father 's sake ; and know you guiltless of this fact , he will stir earth and heaven to bear you clear . ''
`` It may not be , '' say Dick .
`` What can he do ?
He hath but a handful .
Alack , if it be but to-morrow -- could I but keep a certain tryst an hour before noon to-morrow -- all be , I think , otherwise .
But now there be no help . ''
`` Well , '' conclude Lawless , `` an ye will stand to it for my innocence , I will stand to it for yours , and that stoutly .
It shall naught avail u ; but an I be to hang , it shall not be for lack of swearing . ''
And then , while Dick give himself over to his reflection , the old rogue curl himself down into a corner , pull his monkish hood about his face , and compose himself to sleep .
Soon he be loudly snoring , so utterly have his long life of hardship and adventure blunt the sense of apprehension .
It be long after noon , and the day be already fail , before the door be open and Dick take forth and lead up-stairs to where , in a warm cabinet , Earl Risingham sit muse over the fire .
On his captive 's entrance he look up .
`` Sir , '' he say , `` I know your father , who be a man of honour , and this inclineth me to be the more lenient ; but I may not hide from you that heavy charge lie against your character .
Ye do consort with murderer and robber ; upon a clear probation ye have carry war against the king 's peace ; ye be suspect to have piratically seize upon a ship ; ye be find skulk with a counterfeit presentment in your enemy 's house ; a man be slain that very even -- '' `` An it like you , my lord , '' Dick interpose , `` I will at once avow my guilt , such a it be .
I slew this fellow Rutter ; and to the proof '' -- search in his bosom -- `` here be a letter from his wallet . ''
Lord Risingham take the letter , and open and read it twice .
`` Ye have read this ? ''
he inquire .
`` I have read it , '' answer Dick .
`` Are ye for York or Lancaster ? ''
the earl demand .
`` My lord , it be but a little while back that I be ask that question , and know not how to answer it , '' say Dick ; `` but have answer once , I will not vary .
My lord , I be for York . ''
The earl nod approvingly .
`` Honestly reply , '' he say .
`` But wherefore , then , deliver me this letter ? ''
`` Nay , but against traitor , my lord , be not all side array ? ''
cry Dick .
`` I would they be , young gentleman , '' return the earl ; `` and I do at least approve your say .
There be more youth than guile in you , I do perceive ; and be not Sir Daniel a mighty man upon our side , I be half-tempted to espouse your quarrel .
For I have inquire , and it appear ye have be hardly dealt with , and have much excuse .
But look ye , sir , I be , before all else , a leader in the queen 's interest ; and though by nature a just man , a I believe , and lean even to the excess of mercy , yet must I order my going for my party 's interest , and , to keep Sir Daniel , I would go far about . ''
`` My lord , '' return Dick , `` ye will think me very bold to counsel you ; but do ye count upon Sir Daniel 's faith ?
Methought he have change side intolerably often . ''
`` Nay , it be the way of England .
What would ye have ? ''
the earl demand .
`` But ye be unjust to the knight of Tunstall ; and a faith go , in this unfaithful generation , he hath of late be honourably true to u of Lancaster .
Even in our last revers he stand firm . ''
`` An it please you , then , '' say Dick , `` to cast your eye upon this letter , ye might somewhat change your thought of him ; '' and he hand to the earl Sir Daniel 's letter to Lord Wensleydale .
The effect upon the earl 's countenance be instant ; he lower like an angry lion , and his hand , with a sudden movement , clutch at his dagger .
`` Ye have read this also ? ''
he ask .
`` Even so , '' say Dick .
`` It be your lordship 's own estate he offer to Lord Wensleydale ? ''
`` It be my own estate , even a ye say ! ''
return the earl .
`` I be your bedesman for this letter .
It hath show me a fox 's hole .
Command me , Master Shelton ; I will not be backward in gratitude , and to begin with , York or Lancaster , true man or thief , I do now set you at freedom .
Go , a Mary 's name !
But judge it right that I retain and hang your fellow , Lawless .
The crime hath be most open , and it be fit that some open punishment should follow . ''
`` My lord , I make it my first suit to you to spare him also , '' plead Dick .
`` It be an old , condemn rogue , thief , and vagabond , Master Shelton , '' say the earl .
`` He hath be gallows-ripe this score of year .
And , whether for one thing or another , whether to-morrow or the day after , where be the great choice ? ''
`` Yet , my lord , it be through love to me that he come hither , '' answer Dick , `` and I be churlish and thankless to desert him . ''
`` Master Shelton , ye be troublesome , '' reply the earl , severely .
`` It be an evil way to prosper in this world .
Howbeit , and to be quit of your importunity , I will once more humour you .
Go , then , together ; but go warily , and get swiftly out of Shoreby town .
For this Sir Daniel -LRB- whom may the saint confound ! -RRB-
thirsteth most greedily to have your blood . ''
`` My lord , I do now offer you in word my gratitude , trust at some brief date to pay you some of it in service , '' reply Dick , a he turn from the apartment .
CHAPTER VI -- ARBLASTER AGAIN When Dick and Lawless be suffer to steal , by a back way , out of the house where Lord Risingham hold his garrison , the evening have already come .
They pause in shelter of the garden wall to consult on their best course .
The danger be extreme .
If one of Sir Daniel 's men catch sight of them and raise the view-hallo , they would be run down and butcher instantly .
And not only be the town of Shoreby a mere net of peril for their life , but to make for the open country be to run the risk of the patrol .
A little way off , upon some open ground , they spy a windmill stand ; and hard by that , a very large granary with open door .
`` How if we lay there until the night fall ? ''
Dick propose .
And Lawless have no good suggestion to offer , they make a straight push for the granary at a run , and conceal themselves behind the door among some straw .
The daylight rapidly depart ; and presently the moon be silver the frozen snow .
Now or never be their opportunity to gain the Goat and Bagpipes unobserved and change their tell-tale garment .
Yet even then it be advisable to go round by the outskirt , and not run the gauntlet of the market-place , where , in the concourse of people , they stand the more imminent peril to be recognise and slain .
This course be a long one .
It take them not far from the house by the beach , now lie dark and silent , and bring them forth at last by the margin of the harbour .
Many of the ship , a they could see by the clear moonshine , have weigh anchor , and , profit by the calm sky , proceed for more distant part ; answerably to this , the rude alehouses along the beach -LRB- although in defiance of the curfew law , they still shine with fire and candle -RRB- be no longer throng with customer , and no long echo to the chorus of sea-songs .
Hastily , half-running , with their monkish raiment kilted to the knee , they plunge through the deep snow and thread the labyrinth of marine lumber ; and they be already more than half way round the harbour when , a they be pass close before an alehouse , the door suddenly open and let out a gush of light upon their fleeting figure .
Instantly they stop , and make believe to be engage in earnest conversation .
Three men , one after another , come out of the ale-house , and the last close the door behind him .
All three be unsteady upon their foot , a if they have pass the day in deep potation , and they now stand waver in the moonlight , like men who know not what they would be after .
The tallest of the three be talk in a loud , lamentable voice .
`` Seven piece of as good Gascony a ever a tapster broach , '' he be say , `` the best ship out o ' the port o ' Dartmouth , a Virgin Mary parcel-gilt , thirteen pound of good gold money -- '' `` I have bad loss , too , '' interrupt one of the others .
`` I have have loss of mine own , gossip Arblaster .
I be rob at Martinmas of five shilling and a leather wallet well worth ninepence farthing . ''
Dick 's heart smite him at what he hear .
Until that moment he have not perhaps thought twice of the poor skipper who have be ruin by the loss of the Good Hope ; so careless , in those day , be men who wear arm of the good and interest of their inferior .
But this sudden encounter remind him sharply of the high-handed manner and ill-ending of his enterprise ; and both he and Lawless turn their head the other way , to avoid the chance of recognition .
The ship 's dog have , however , make his escape from the wreck and find his way back again to Shoreby .
He be now at Arblaster 's heel , and suddenly sniff and prick his ear , he dart forward and begin to bark furiously at the two sham friar .
His master unsteadily follow him .
`` Hey , shipmates ! ''
he cry .
`` Have ye ever a penny pie for a poor old shipman , clean destroy by pirate ?
I be a man that would have pay for you both o ' Thursday morning ; and now here I be , o ' Saturday night , beg for a flagon of ale !
Ask my man Tom , if ye misdoubt me .
Seven piece of good Gascon wine , a ship that be mine own , and be my father 's before me , a Blessed Mary of plane-tree wood and parcel-gilt , and thirteen pound in gold and silver .
Hey !
what say ye ?
A man that fight the French , too ; for I have fight the French ; I have cut more French throat upon the high sea than ever a man that sail out of Dartmouth .
Come , a penny piece . ''
Neither Dick nor Lawless durst answer him a word , lest he should recognise their voice ; and they stand there as helpless a a ship ashore , not know where to turn nor what to hope .
`` Are ye dumb , boy ? ''
inquire the skipper .
`` Mates , '' he add , with a hiccup , `` they be dumb .
I like not this manner of discourtesy ; for an a man be dumb , so be a he 's courteous , he will still speak when he be speak to , methinks . ''
By this time the sailor , Tom , who be a man of great personal strength , seem to have conceive some suspicion of these two speechless figure ; and be sober than his captain , step suddenly before him , take Lawless roughly by the shoulder , and ask him , with an oath , what ail him that he hold his tongue .
To this the outlaw , think all be over , make answer by a wrestling feint that stretch the sailor on the sand , and , call upon Dick to follow him , take to his heel among the lumber .
The affair pass in a second .
Before Dick could run at all , Arblaster have him in his arm ; Tom , crawl on his face , have catch him by one foot , and the third man have a drawn cutlas brandish above his head .
It be not so much the danger , it be not so much the annoyance , that now bow down the spirit of young Shelton ; it be the profound humiliation to have escape Sir Daniel , convince Lord Risingham , and now fall helpless in the hand of this old , drunken sailor ; and not merely helpless , but , a his conscience loudly tell him when it be too late , actually guilty -- actually the bankrupt debtor of the man whose ship he have steal and lose .
`` Bring me him back into the alehouse , till I see his face , '' say Arblaster .
`` Nay , nay , '' return Tom ; `` but let u first unload his wallet , lest the other lad cry share . ''
But though he be search from head to foot , not a penny be find upon him ; nothing but Lord Foxham 's signet , which they pluck savagely from his finger .
`` Turn me him to the moon , '' say the skipper ; and take Dick by the chin , he cruelly jerk his head into the air .
`` Blessed Virgin ! ''
he cry , `` it be the pirate ! ''
`` Hey ! ''
cry Tom .
`` By the Virgin of Bordeaux , it be the man himself ! ''
repeat Arblaster .
`` What , sea-thief , do I hold you ? ''
he cry .
`` Where be my ship ?
Where be my wine ?
Hey !
have I you in my hand ?
Tom , give me one end of a cord here ; I will so truss me this sea-thief , hand and foot together , like a basting turkey -- marry , I will so bind him up -- and thereafter I will so beat -- so beat him ! ''
And so he run on , wind the cord meanwhile about Dick 's limb with the dexterity peculiar to seaman , and at every turn and cross secure it with a knot , and tighten the whole fabric with a savage pull .
When he have do , the lad be a mere package in his hand -- as helpless a the dead .
The skipper hold him at arm 's length , and laugh aloud .
Then he fetch him a stun buffet on the ear ; and then turn him about , and furiously kick and kick him .
Anger rise up in Dick 's bosom like a storm ; anger strangle him , and he think to have die ; but when the sailor , tire of this cruel play , drop him all his length upon the sand and turn to consult with his companion , he instantly regain command of his temper .
Here be a momentary respite ; ere they begin again to torture him , he might have find some method to escape from this degrading and fatal misadventure .
Presently , sure enough , and while his captor be still discuss what to do with him , he take heart of grace , and , with a pretty steady voice , address them .
`` My master , '' he begin , `` be ye go clean foolish ?
Here hath Heaven put into your hand a pretty an occasion to grow rich a ever shipman have -- such a ye might make thirty over-sea adventure and not find again -- and , by the mass I what do ye ?
Beat me ?
-- nay ; so would an angry child !
But for long-headed tarry-Johns , that fear not fire nor water , and that love gold a they love beef , methinks ye be not wise . ''
`` Ay , '' say Tom , `` now y ' be truss ye would cozen u . ''
`` Cozen you ! ''
repeat Dick .
`` Nay , if ye be fool , it would be easy .
But if ye be shrewd fellow , a I trow ye be , ye can see plainly where your interest lie .
When I take your ship from you , we be many , we be well clad and arm ; but now , bethink you a little , who muster that array ?
One incontestably that hath much gold .
And if he , be already rich , continueth to hunt after more even in the face of storm -- bethink you once more -- shall there not be a treasure somewhere hide ? ''
`` What meaneth he ? ''
ask one of the men .
`` Why , if ye have lose an old skiff and a few jug of vinegary wine , '' continue Dick , `` forget them , for the trash they be ; and do ye rather buckle to an adventure worth the name , that shall , in twelve hour , make or mar you for ever .
But take me up from where I lie , and let u go somewhere near at hand and talk across a flagon , for I be sore and frozen , and my mouth be half among the snow . ''
`` He seek but to cozen u , '' say Tom , contemptuously .
`` Cozen !
cozen ! ''
cry the third man .
`` I would I could see the man that could cozen me !
He be a cozener indeed !
Nay , I be not bear yesterday .
I can see a church when it hath a steeple on it ; and for my part , gossip Arblaster , methinks there be some sense in this young man .
Shall we go hear him , indeed ?
Say , shall we go hear him ? ''
`` I would look gladly on a pottle of strong ale , good Master Pirret , '' return Arblaster .
`` How say ye , Tom ?
But then the wallet be empty . ''
`` I will pay , '' say the other -- `` I will pay .
I would fain see this matter out ; I do believe , upon my conscience , there be gold in it . ''
`` Nay , if ye get again to drinking , all be lose ! ''
cry Tom .
`` Gossip Arblaster , ye suffer your fellow to have too much liberty , '' return Master Pirret .
`` Would ye be lead by a hired man ?
Fy , fy ! ''
`` Peace , fellow ! ''
say Arblaster , address Tom .
`` Will ye put your oar in ?
Truly a fine pas , when the crew be to correct the skipper ! ''
`` Well , then , go your way , '' say Tom ; `` I wash my hand of you . ''
`` Set him , then , upon his foot , '' say Master Pirret .
`` I know a privy place where we may drink and discourse . ''
`` If I be to walk , my friend , ye must set my foot at liberty , '' say Dick , when he have be once more planted upright like a post .
`` He saith true , '' laugh Pirret .
`` Truly , he could not walk accoutre a he be .
Give it a slit -- out with your knife and slit it , gossip . ''
Even Arblaster pause at this proposal ; but a his companion continue to insist , and Dick have the sense to keep the mere wooden indifference of expression , and only shrug his shoulder over the delay , the skipper consent at last , and cut the cord which tie his prisoner 's foot and leg .
Not only do this enable Dick to walk ; but the whole network of his bond be proportionately loosen , he felt the arm behind his back begin to move more freely , and could hope , with time and trouble , to entirely disengage it .
So much he owe already to the owlish silliness and greed of Master Pirret .
That worthy now assume the lead , and conduct them to the very same rude alehouse where Lawless have take Arblaster on the day of the gale .
It be now quite desert ; the fire be a pile of red ember , radiate the most ardent heat ; and when they have choose their place , and the landlord have set before them a measure of mulled ale , both Pirret and Arblaster stretch forth their leg and square their elbow like men bend upon a pleasant hour .
The table at which they sit , like all the others in the alehouse , consist of a heavy , square board , set on a pair of barrel ; and each of the four curiously-assorted crony sit at one side of the square , Pirret face Arblaster , and Dick opposite to the common sailor .
`` And now , young man , '' say Pirret , `` to your tale .
It doth appear , indeed , that ye have somewhat abused our gossip Arblaster ; but what then ?
Make it up to him -- show him but this chance to become wealthy -- and I will go pledge he will forgive you . ''
So far Dick have speak pretty much at random ; but it be now necessary , under the supervision of six eye , to invent and tell some marvellous story , and , if it be possible , get back into his hand the all-important signet .
To squander time be the first necessity .
The longer his stay last , the more would his captor drink , and the surer should he be when he attempt his escape .
Well , Dick be not much of an inventor , and what he tell be pretty much the tale of Ali Baba , with Shoreby and Tunstall Forest substitute for the East , and the treasure of the cavern rather exaggerate than diminish .
As the reader be aware , it be an excellent story , and have but one drawback -- that it be not true ; and so , a these three simple shipmen now hear it for the first time , their eye stand out of their face , and their mouth gap like codfish at a fishmonger 's .
Pretty soon a second measure of mulled ale be call for ; and while Dick be still artfully spin out the incident a third follow the second .
Here be the position of the party towards the end : Arblaster , three-parts drunk and one-half asleep , hung helpless on his stool .
Even Tom have be much delight with the tale , and his vigilance have abate in proportion .
Meanwhile , Dick have gradually worm his right arm clear of it bond , and be ready to risk all .
`` And so , '' say Pirret , `` y ' be one of these ? ''
`` I be make so , '' reply Dick , `` against my will ; but an I could but get a sack or two of gold coin to my share , I should be a fool indeed to continue dwell in a filthy cave , and stand shot and buffet like a soldier .
Here be we four ; good !
Let u , then , go forth into the forest to-morrow ere the sun be up .
Could we come honestly by a donkey , it be well ; but an we can not , we have our four strong back , and I warrant me we shall come home staggering . ''
Pirret lick his lip .
`` And this magic , '' he say -- `` this password , whereby the cave be open -- how call ye it , friend ? ''
`` Nay , none know the word but the three chief , '' return Dick ; `` but here be your great good fortune , that , on this very evening , I should be the bearer of a spell to open it .
It be a thing not trust twice a year beyond the captain 's wallet . ''
`` A spell ! ''
say Arblaster , half awakening , and squint upon Dick with one eye .
`` Aroint thee !
no spell !
I be a good Christian .
Ask my man Tom , else . ''
`` Nay , but this be white magic , '' say Dick .
`` It doth naught with the devil ; only the power of number , herb , and planet . ''
`` Ay , ay , '' say Pirret ; '' 't be but white magic , gossip .
There be no sin therein , I do assure you .
But proceed , good youth .
This spell -- in what should it consist ? ''
`` Nay , that I will incontinently show you , '' answer Dick .
`` Have ye there the ring ye take from my finger ?
Good !
Now hold it forth before you by the extreme finger-ends , at the arm 's - length , and over against the shining of these ember .
'T be so exactly .
Thus , then , be the spell . ''
With a haggard glance , Dick saw the coast be clear between him and the door .
He put up an internal prayer .
Then whip forth his arm , he make but one snatch of the ring , and at the same instant , lever up the table , he send it bodily over upon the seaman Tom .
He , poor soul , go down bawl under the ruin ; and before Arblaster understand that anything be wrong , or Pirret could collect his dazzled wit , Dick have run to the door and escape into the moonlit night .
The moon , which now ride in the mid-heavens , and the extreme whiteness of the snow , make the open ground about the harbour bright a day ; and young Shelton leaping , with kilted robe , among the lumber , be a conspicuous figure from afar .
Tom and Pirret follow him with shout ; from every drinking-shop they be join by others whom their cry arouse ; and presently a whole fleet of sailor be in full pursuit .
But Jack ashore be a bad runner , even in the fifteenth century , and Dick , besides , have a start , which he rapidly improve , until , a he draw near the entrance of a narrow lane , he even pause and look laughingly behind him .
Upon the white floor of snow , all the shipmen of Shoreby come cluster in an inky mass , and tail out rearward in isolated clump .
Every man be shout or scream ; every man be gesticulate with both arm in air ; some one be continually fall ; and to complete the picture , when one fell , a dozen would fall upon the top of him .
The confused mass of sound which they roll up as high a to the moon be partly comical and partly terrify to the fugitive whom they be hunt .
In itself , it be impotent , for he make sure no seaman in the port could run him down .
But the mere volume of noise , in so far a it must awake all the sleeper in Shoreby and bring all the skulk sentry to the street , do really threaten him with danger in the front .
So , spy a dark doorway at a corner , he whip briskly into it , and let the uncouth hunt go by him , still shout and gesticulating , and all red with hurry and white with tumble in the snow .
It be a long while , indeed , before this great invasion of the town by the harbour come to an end , and it be long before silence be restore .
For long , lose sailor be still to be hear pound and shout through the street in all direction and in every quarter of the town .
Quarrels follow , sometimes among themselves , sometimes with the men of the patrol ; knife be draw , blow give and receive , and more than one dead body remain behind upon the snow .
When , a full hour later , the last seaman return grumblingly to the harbour side and his particular tavern , it may fairly be question if he have ever know what manner of man he be pursue , but it be absolutely sure that he have now forget .
By next morning there be many strange story fly ; and a little while after , the legend of the devil 's nocturnal visit be an article of faith with all the lad of Shoreby .
But the return of the last seaman do not , even yet , set free young Shelton from his cold imprisonment in the doorway .
For some time after , there be a great activity of patrol ; and special party come forth to make the round of the place and report to one or other of the great lord , whose slumber have be thus unusually broken .
The night be already well spend before Dick venture from his hiding-place and come , safe and sound , but ache with cold and bruise , to the door of the Goat and Bagpipes .
As the law require , there be neither fire nor candle in the house ; but he grope his way into a corner of the icy guest-room , find an end of a blanket , which he hitch around his shoulder , and creep close to the near sleeper , be soon lose in slumber .
BOOK V -- CROOKBACK CHAPTER I -- THE SHRILL TRUMPET Very early the next morning , before the first peep of the day , Dick arise , change his garment , arm himself once more like a gentleman , and set forth for Lawless 's den in the forest .
There , it will be remember , he have leave Lord Foxham 's paper ; and to get these and be back in time for the tryst with the young Duke of Gloucester could only be manage by an early start and the most vigorous walking .
The frost be more rigorous than ever ; the air windless and dry , and sting to the nostril .
The moon have go down , but the star be still bright and numerous , and the reflection from the snow be clear and cheerful .
There be no need for a lamp to walk by ; nor , in that still but ring air , the least temptation to delay .
Dick have cross the great part of the open ground between Shoreby and the forest , and have reach the bottom of the little hill , some hundred yard below the Cross of St. Bride , when , through the stillness of the black morn , there ring forth the note of a trumpet , so shrill , clear , and piercing , that he think he have never hear the match of it for audibility .
It be blow once , and then hurriedly a second time ; and then the clash of steel succeed .
At this young Shelton prick his ear , and draw his sword , run forward up the hill .
Presently he come in sight of the cross , and be aware of a most fierce encounter rag on the road before it .
There be seven or eight assailant , and but one to keep head against them ; but so active and dexterous be this one , so desperately do he charge and scatter his opponent , so deftly keep his footing on the ice , that already , before Dick could intervene , he have slay one , wound another , and keep the whole in check .
Still , it be by a miracle that he continue his defence , and at any moment , any accident , the least slip of foot or error of hand , his life would be a forfeit .
`` Hold ye well , sir !
Here be help ! ''
cried Richard ; and forget that he be alone , and that the cry be somewhat irregular , `` To the Arrow !
to the Arrow ! ''
he shout , a he fell upon the rear of the assailant .
These be stout fellow also , for they give not an inch at this surprise , but face about , and fell with astonishing fury upon Dick .
Four against one , the steel flash about him in the starlight ; the spark fly fiercely ; one of the men oppose to him fell -- in the stir of the fight he hardly know why ; then he himself be strike across the head , and though the steel cap below his hood protect him , the blow beat him down upon one knee , with a brain whirling like a windmill sail .
Meanwhile the man whom he have come to rescue , instead of join in the conflict , have , on the first sign of intervention , leap aback and blown again , and yet more urgently and loudly , on that same shrill-voiced trumpet that begin the alarm .
Next moment , indeed , his foe be on him , and he be once more charging and fleeing , leaping , stab , drop to his knee , and use indifferently sword and dagger , foot and hand , with the same unshaken courage and feverish energy and speed .
But that ear-piercing summons have be hear at last .
There be a muffled rushing in the snow ; and in a good hour for Dick , who saw the sword-points glitter already at his throat , there pour forth out of the wood upon both side a disorderly torrent of mounted man-at-arms , each case in iron , and with visor lower , each bear his lance in rest , or his sword bar and raise , and each carrying , so to speak , a passenger , in the shape of an archer or page , who leap one after another from their perch , and have presently double the array .
The original assailant ; see themselves outnumbered and surround , throw down their arm without a word .
`` Seize me these fellow ! ''
say the hero of the trumpet ; and when his order have be obey , he draw near to Dick and look him in the face .
Dick , return this scrutiny , be surprise to find in one who have display such strength , skill and energy , a lad no old than himself -- slightly deform , with one shoulder high than the other , and of a pale , painful , and distort countenance .
-LCB- 2 -RCB- The eye , however , be very clear and bold .
`` Sir , '' say this lad , `` ye come in good time for me , and none too early . ''
`` My lord , '' return Dick , with a faint sense that he be in the presence of a great personage , `` ye be yourself so marvellous a good swordsman that I believe ye have manage them single-handed .
Howbeit , it be certainly well for me that your men delay no long than they do . ''
`` How knew ye who I be ? ''
demand the stranger .
`` Even now , my lord , '' Dick answer , `` I be ignorant of whom I speak with . ''
`` Is it so ? ''
ask the other .
`` And yet ye throw yourself head first into this unequal battle . ''
`` I saw one man valiantly contend against many , '' reply Dick , `` and I have think myself dishonour not to bear him aid . ''
A singular sneer play about the young nobleman 's mouth a he make answer : `` These be very brave word .
But to the more essential -- be ye Lancaster or York ? ''
`` My lord , I make no secret ; I be clear for York , '' Dick answer .
`` By the mass ! ''
reply the other , `` it be well for you . ''
And so saying , he turn towards one of his follower .
`` Let me see , '' he continue , in the same sneering and cruel tone -- `` let me see a clean end of these brave gentleman .
Truss me them up . ''
There be but five survivor of the attack party .
Archers seize them by the arm ; they be hurry to the border of the wood , and each place below a tree of suitable dimension ; the rope be adjust ; an archer , carry the end of it , hastily clamber overhead ; and before a minute be over , and without a word passing upon either hand , the five men be swing by the neck .
`` And now , '' cry the deformed leader , `` back to your post , and when I summon you next , be ready to attend . ''
`` My lord duke , '' say one man , `` beseech you , tarry not here alone .
Keep but a handful of lance at your hand . ''
`` Fellow , '' say the duke , `` I have forbear to chide you for your slowness .
Cross me not , therefore .
I trust my hand and arm , for all that I be crook .
Ye be backward when the trumpet sound ; and ye be now too forward with your counsel .
But it be ever so ; last with the lance and first with tongue .
Let it be reverse . ''
And with a gesture that be not without a sort of dangerous nobility , he wave them off .
The footman climb again to their seat behind the man-at-arms , and the whole party move slowly away and disappear in twenty different direction , under the cover of the forest .
The day be by this time begin to break , and the star to fade .
The first grey glimmer of dawn shone upon the countenance of the two young men , who now turn once more to face each other .
`` Here , '' say the duke , `` ye have see my vengeance , which be , like my blade , both sharp and ready .
But I would not have you , for all Christendom , suppose me thankless .
You that come to my aid with a good sword and a good courage -- unless that ye recoil from my misshapenness -- come to my heart . ''
And so saying , the young leader hold out his arm for an embrace .
In the bottom of his heart Dick already entertain a great terror and some hatred for the man whom he have rescue ; but the invitation be so worded that it would not have be merely discourteous , but cruel , to refuse or hesitate ; and he hasten to comply .
`` And now , my lord duke , '' he say , when he have regain his freedom , `` do I suppose aright ?
Are ye my Lord Duke of Gloucester ? ''
`` I be Richard of Gloucester , '' return the other .
`` And you -- how call they you ? ''
Dick tell him his name , and present Lord Foxham 's signet , which the duke immediately recognise .
`` Ye come too soon , '' he say ; `` but why should I complain ?
Ye be like me , that be here at watch two hour before the day .
But this be the first sally of mine arm ; upon this adventure , Master Shelton , shall I make or mar the quality of my renown .
There lie mine enemy , under two old , skilled captain -- Risingham and Brackley -- well post for strength , I do believe , but yet upon two side without retreat , enclose betwixt the sea , the harbour , and the river .
Methinks , Shelton , here be a great blow to be stricken , an we could strike it silently and suddenly . ''
`` I do think so , indeed , '' cry Dick , warm .
`` Have ye my Lord Foxham 's note ? ''
inquire the duke .
And then , Dick , have explain how he be without them for the moment , make himself bold to offer information every jot a good , of his own knowledge .
`` And for mine own part , my lord duke , '' he add , `` an ye have men enough , I would fall on even at this present .
For , look ye , at the peep of day the watch of the night be over ; but by day they keep neither watch nor ward -- only scour the outskirt with horseman .
Now , then , when the night watch be already unarmed , and the rest be at their morning cup -- now be the time to break them . ''
`` How many do ye count ? ''
ask Gloucester .
`` They number not two thousand , '' Dick reply .
`` I have seven hundred in the wood behind u , '' say the duke ; `` seven hundred follow from Kettley , and will be here anon ; behind these , and far , be four hundred more ; and my Lord Foxham hath five hundred half a day from here , at Holywood .
Shall we attend their coming , or fall on ? ''
`` My lord , '' say Dick , `` when ye hang these five poor rogue ye do decide the question .
Churls although they be , in these uneasy , time they will be lack and look for , and the alarm be give .
Therefore , my lord , if ye do count upon the advantage of a surprise , ye have not , in my poor opinion , one whole hour in front of you . ''
`` I do think so indeed , '' return Crookback .
`` Well , before an hour , ye shall be in the thick o n't , win spur .
A swift man to Holywood , carry Lord Foxham 's signet ; another along the road to speed my laggard !
Nay , Shelton , by the rood , it may be do ! ''
Therewith he once more set his trumpet to his lip and blew .
This time he be not long keep wait .
In a moment the open space about the cross be fill with horse and foot .
Richard of Gloucester take his place upon the step , and despatch messenger after messenger to hasten the concentration of the seven hundred men that lay hide in the immediate neighbourhood among the wood ; and before a quarter of an hour have pass , all his disposition be take , he put himself at their head , and begin to move down the hill towards Shoreby .
His plan be simple .
He be to seize a quarter of the town of Shoreby lie on the right hand of the high road , and make his position good there in the narrow lane until his reinforcement follow .
If Lord Risingham choose to retreat , Richard would follow upon his rear , and take him between two fire ; or , if he prefer to hold the town , he would be shut in a trap , there to be gradually overwhelm by force of number .
There be but one danger , but that be imminent and great -- Gloucester 's seven hundred might be roll up and cut to piece in the first encounter , and , to avoid this , it be needful to make the surprise of their arrival as complete a possible .
The footman , therefore , be all once more take up behind the rider , and Dick have the signal honour meted out to him of mount behind Gloucester himself .
For as far a there be any cover the troop move slowly , and when they come near the end of the tree that line the highway , stop to breathe and reconnoitre .
The sun be now well up , shin with a frosty brightness out of a yellow halo , and right over against the luminary , Shoreby , a field of snowy roof and ruddy gable , be roll up it column of morning smoke .
Gloucester turn round to Dick .
`` In that poor place , '' he say , `` where people be cook breakfast , either you shall gain your spur and I begin a life of mighty honour and glory in the world 's eye , or both of u , a I conceive it , shall fall dead and be unheard of .
Two Richards be we .
Well , then , Richard Shelton , they shall be hear about , these two !
Their sword shall not ring more loudly on men 's helmet than their name shall ring in people 's ear . ''
Dick be astonish at so great a hunger after fame , express with so great vehemence of voice and language , and he answer very sensibly and quietly , that , for his part , he promise he would do his duty , and doubt not of victory if everyone do the like .
By this time the horse be well breathe , and the leader hold up his sword and give rein , the whole troop of charger break into the gallop and thunder , with their double load of fight men , down the remainder of the hill and across the snow-covered plain that still divide them from Shoreby .
CHAPTER II -- THE BATTLE OF SHOREBY The whole distance to be cross be not above a quarter of a mile .
But they have no sooner debauch beyond the cover of the tree than they be aware of people flee and scream in the snowy meadows upon either hand .
Almost at the same moment a great rumour begin to arise , and spread and grow continually louder in the town ; and they be not yet halfway to the near house before the bell begin to ring backward from the steeple .
The young duke ground his teeth together .
By these so early signal of alarm he fear to find his enemy prepare ; and if he fail to gain a footing in the town , he know that his small party would soon be break and exterminate in the open .
In the town , however , the Lancastrians be far from be in so good a posture .
It be a Dick have say .
The night-guard have already doff their harness ; the rest be still hang -- unlatched , unbraced , all unprepared for battle -- about their quarter ; and in the whole of Shoreby there be not , perhaps , fifty men full arm , or fifty charger ready to be mount .
The beating of the bell , the terrify summons of men who run about the street cry and beat upon the door , arouse in an incredibly short space at least two score out of that half hundred .
These get speedily to horse , and , the alarm still fly wild and contrary , gallop in different direction .
Thus it befall that , when Richard of Gloucester reach the first house of Shoreby , he be meet in the mouth of the street by a mere handful of lance , whom he sweep before his onset a the storm chase the bark .
A hundred pace into the town , Dick Shelton touch the duke 's arm ; the duke , in answer , gather his rein , put the shrill trumpet to his mouth , and blow a concerted point , turn to the right hand out of the direct advance .
Swerving like a single rider , his whole command turn after him , and , still at the full gallop of the charger , sweep up the narrow bye-street .
Only the last score of rider draw rein and face about in the entrance ; the footman , whom they carry behind them , leapt at the same instant to the earth , and begin , some to bend their bow , and others to break into and secure the house upon either hand .
Surprised at this sudden change of direction , and daunt by the firm front of the rear-guard , the few Lancastrians , after a momentary consultation , turn and ride farther into town to seek for reinforcement .
The quarter of the town upon which , by the advice of Dick , Richard of Gloucester have now seize , consist of five small street of poor and ill-inhabited house , occupy a very gentle eminence , and lie open towards the back .
The five street be each secure by a good guard , the reserve would thus occupy the centre , out of shot , and yet ready to carry aid wherever it be need .
Such be the poorness of the neighbourhood that none of the Lancastrian lord , and but few of their retainer , have be lodge therein ; and the inhabitant , with one accord , desert their house and flee , squall , along the street or over garden wall .
In the centre , where the five way all meet , a somewhat ill-favoured alehouse display the sign of the Chequers ; and here the Duke of Gloucester choose his headquarters for the day .
To Dick he assign the guard of one of the five street .
`` Go , '' he say , `` win your spur .
Win glory for me : one Richard for another .
I tell you , if I rise , ye shall rise by the same ladder .
Go , '' he add , shake him by the hand .
But , as soon a Dick be go , he turn to a little shabby archer at his elbow .
`` Go , Dutton , and that right speedily , '' he add .
`` Follow that lad .
If ye find him faithful , ye answer for his safety , a head for a head .
Woe unto you , if ye return without him !
But if he be faithless -- or , for one instant , ye misdoubt him -- stab him from behind . ''
In the meanwhile Dick hasten to secure his post .
The street he have to guard be very narrow , and closely line with house , which project and overhang the roadway ; but narrow and dark a it be , since it open upon the market-place of the town , the main issue of the battle would probably fall to be decide on that spot .
The market-place be full of townspeople fleeing in disorder ; but there be a yet no sign of any foeman ready to attack , and Dick judge he have some time before him to make ready his defence .
The two house at the end stand desert , with open door , a the inhabitant have leave them in their flight , and from these he have the furniture hastily toss forth and pile into a barrier in the entry of the lane .
A hundred men be place at his disposal , and of these he throw the more part into the house , where they might lie in shelter and deliver their arrow from the window .
With the rest , under his own immediate eye , he line the barricade .
Meanwhile the utmost uproar and confusion have continue to prevail throughout the town ; and what with the hurried clashing of bell , the sounding of trumpet , the swift movement of body of horse , the cry of the commander , and the shriek of woman , the noise be almost deafen to the ear .
Presently , little by little , the tumult begin to subside ; and soon after , file of men in armour and body of archer begin to assemble and form in line of battle in the market-place .
A large portion of this body be in murrey and blue , and in the mounted knight who order their array Dick recognise Sir Daniel Brackley .
Then there befall a long pause , which be follow by the almost simultaneous sounding of four trumpet from four different quarter of the town .
A fifth rang in answer from the market-place , and at the same moment the file begin to move , and a shower of arrow rattle about the barricade , and sound like blow upon the wall of the two flanking house .
The attack have begin , by a common signal , on all the five issue of the quarter .
Gloucester be beleaguer upon every side ; and Dick judge , if he would make good his post , he must rely entirely on the hundred men of his command .
Seven volley of arrow follow one upon the other , and in the very thick of the discharge Dick be touch from behind upon the arm , and find a page hold out to him a leathern jack , strengthen with bright plate of mail .
`` It be from my Lord of Gloucester , '' say the page .
`` He hath observe , Sir Richard , that ye go unarmed . ''
Dick , with a glow at his heart at be so addressed , get to his foot and , with the assistance of the page , don the defensive coat .
Even a he do so , two arrow rattle harmlessly upon the plate , and a third struck down the page , mortally wound , at his foot .
Meantime the whole body of the enemy have be steadily draw nearer across the market-place ; and by this time be so close at hand that Dick give the order to return their shot .
Immediately , from behind the barrier and from the window of the house , a counterblast of arrow speed , carry death .
But the Lancastrians , a if they have but wait for a signal , shout loudly in answer ; and begin to close at a run upon the barrier , the horseman still hang back , with visor lower .
Then follow an obstinate and deadly struggle , hand to hand .
The assailant , wield their falchion with one hand , strove with the other to drag down the structure of the barricade .
On the other side , the part be reverse ; and the defender expose themselves like madman to protect their rampart .
So for some minute the contest rag almost in silence , friend and foe fall one upon another .
But it be always the easy to destroy ; and when a single note upon the tucket recall the attack party from this desperate service , much of the barricade have be remove piecemeal , and the whole fabric have sink to half it height , and totter to a general fall .
And now the footman in the market-place fell back , at a run , on every side .
The horseman , who have be stand in a line two deep , wheel suddenly , and make their flank into their front ; and as swift a a striking adder , the long , steel-clad column be launch upon the ruinous barricade .
Of the first two horseman , one fell , rider and steed , and be ride down by his companion .
The second leaped clean upon the summit of the rampart , transpiercing an archer with his lance .
Almost in the same instant he be drag from the saddle and his horse despatch .
And then the full weight and impetus of the charge burst upon and scatter the defender .
The man-at-arms , surmount their fall comrade , and carry onward by the fury of their onslaught , dash through Dick 's broken line and pour thunder up the lane beyond , a a stream bestrides and pours across a broken dam .
Yet be the fight not over .
Still , in the narrow jaw of the entrance , Dick and a few survivor ply their bill like woodman ; and already , across the width of the passage , there have be form a second , a high , and a more effectual rampart of fall men and disembowelled horse , lash in the agony of death .
Baffled by this fresh obstacle , the remainder of the cavalry fell back ; and a , at the sight of this movement , the flight of arrow redouble from the casement of the house , their retreat have , for a moment , almost degenerate into flight .
Almost at the same time , those who have cross the barricade and charge far up the street , be meet before the door of the Chequers by the formidable hunchback and the whole reserve of the Yorkists , begin to come scatter backward , in the excess of disarray and terror .
Dick and his fellow face about , fresh men pour out of the house ; a cruel blast of arrow meet the fugitive full in the face , while Gloucester be already rid down their rear ; in the inside of a minute and a half there be no living Lancastrian in the street .
Then , and not till then , do Dick hold up his reek blade and give the word to cheer .
Meanwhile Gloucester dismount from his horse and come forward to inspect the post .
His face be as pale a linen ; but his eye shone in his head like some strange jewel , and his voice , when he speak , be hoarse and broken with the exultation of battle and success .
He look at the rampart , which neither friend nor foe could now approach without precaution , so fiercely do the horse struggle in the throe of death , and at the sight of that great carnage he smile upon one side .
`` Despatch these horse , '' he say ; `` they keep you from your vantage .
Richard Shelton , '' he add , `` ye have please me .
Kneel . ''
The Lancastrians have already resume their archery , and the shaft fell thick in the mouth of the street ; but the duke , mind them not at all , deliberately draw his sword and dub Richard a knight upon the spot .
`` And now , Sir Richard , '' he continue , `` if that ye see Lord Risingham , send me an express upon the instant .
Were it your last man , let me hear of it incontinently .
I have rather venture the post than lose my stroke at him .
For mark me , all of ye , '' he add , raise his voice , `` if Earl Risingham fall by another hand than mine , I shall count this victory a defeat . ''
`` My lord duke , '' say one of his attendant , `` be your grace not weary of expose his dear life unneedfully ?
Why tarry we here ? ''
`` Catesby , '' return the duke , `` here be the battle , not elsewhere .
The rest be but feigned onslaught .
Here must we vanquish .
And for the exposure -- if ye be an ugly hunchback , and the child gecked at you upon the street , ye would count your body cheap , and an hour of glory worth a life .
Howbeit , if ye will , let u ride on and visit the other post .
Sir Richard here , my namesake , he shall still hold this entry , where he wadeth to the ankle in hot blood .
Him can we trust .
But mark it , Sir Richard , ye be not yet do .
The bad be yet to ward .
Sleep not . ''
He come right up to young Shelton , look him hard in the eye , and take his hand in both of his , give it so extreme a squeeze that the blood have nearly spurt .
Dick quail before his eye .
The insane excitement , the courage , and the cruelty that he read therein fill him with dismay about the future .
This young duke 's be indeed a gallant spirit , to ride foremost in the rank of war ; but after the battle , in the day of peace and in the circle of his trusted friend , that mind , it be to be dread , would continue to bring forth the fruit of death .
CHAPTER III -- THE BATTLE OF SHOREBY -LRB- Concluded -RRB- Dick , once more left to his own counsel , begin to look about him .
The arrow-shot have somewhat slacken .
On all side the enemy be fall back ; and the great part of the market-place be now left empty , the snow here trample into orange mud , there splash with gore , scatter all over with dead men and horse , and bristle thick with feathered arrow .
On his own side the loss have be cruel .
The jaw of the little street and the ruin of the barricade be heap with the dead and die ; and out of the hundred men with whom he have begin the battle , there be not seventy left who could still stand to arm .
At the same time , the day be pass .
The first reinforcement might be look for to arrive at any moment ; and the Lancastrians , already shake by the result of their desperate but unsuccessful onslaught , be in an ill temper to support a fresh invader .
There be a dial in the wall of one of the two flanking house ; and this , in the frosty winter sunshine , indicate ten of the forenoon .
Dick turn to the man who be at his elbow , a little insignificant archer , bind a cut in his arm .
`` It be well fought , '' he say , `` and , by my sooth , they will not charge u twice . ''
`` Sir , '' say the little archer , `` ye have fight right well for York , and good for yourself .
Never hath man in so brief space prevail so greatly on the duke 's affection .
That he should have entrust such a post to one he know not be a marvel .
But look to your head , Sir Richard !
If ye be vanquish -- ay , if ye give way one foot 's breadth -- axe or cord shall punish it ; and I be set if ye do aught doubtful , I will tell you honestly , here to stab you from behind . ''
Dick look at the little man in amaze .
`` You ! ''
he cry .
`` And from behind ! ''
`` It be right so , '' return the archer ; `` and because I like not the affair I tell it you .
Ye must make the post good , Sir Richard , at your peril .
O , our Crookback be a bold blade and a good warrior ; but , whether in cold blood or in hot , he will have all thing do exact to his commandment .
If any fail or hinder , they shall die the death . ''
`` Now , by the saint ! ''
cry Richard , `` be this so ?
And will men follow such a leader ? ''
`` Nay , they follow him gleefully , '' reply the other ; `` for if he be exact to punish , he be most open-handed to reward .
And if he spare not the blood and sweat of others , he be ever liberal of his own , still in the first front of battle , still the last to sleep .
He will go far , will Crookback Dick o ' Gloucester ! ''
The young knight , if he have before be brave and vigilant , be now all the more inclined to watchfulness and courage .
His sudden favour , he begin to perceive , have bring peril in it train .
And he turn from the archer , and once more scanned anxiously the market-place .
It lay empty a before .
`` I like not this quietude , '' he say .
`` Doubtless they prepare u some surprise . ''
And , a if in answer to his remark , the archer begin once more to advance against the barricade , and the arrow to fall thick .
But there be something hesitating in the attack .
They come not on roundly , but seem rather to await a further signal .
Dick look uneasily about him , spy for a hidden danger .
And sure enough , about half way up the little street , a door be suddenly open from within , and the house continue , for some second , and both by door and window , to disgorge a torrent of Lancastrian archer .
These , a they leap down , hurriedly stand to their rank , bend their bow , and proceed to pour upon Dick 's rear a flight of arrow .
At the same time , the assailant in the market-place redouble their shot , and begin to close in stoutly upon the barricade .
Dick call down his whole command out of the house , and face them both way , and encourage their valour both by word and gesture , return a best he could the double shower of shaft that fell about his post .
Meanwhile house after house be open in the street , and the Lancastrians continue to pour out of the door and leap down from the window , shout victory , until the number of enemy upon Dick 's rear be almost equal to the number in his face .
It be plain that he could hold the post no longer ; what be bad , even if he could have hold it , it have now become useless ; and the whole Yorkist army lay in a posture of helplessness upon the brink of a complete disaster .
The men behind him form the vital flaw in the general defence ; and it be upon these that Dick turn , charge at the head of his men .
So vigorous be the attack , that the Lancastrian archer give ground and stagger , and , at last , break their rank , begin to crowd back into the house from which they have so recently and so vaingloriously sallied .
Meanwhile the men from the market-place have swarm across the undefended barricade , and fell on hotly upon the other side ; and Dick must once again face about , and proceed to drive them back .
Once again the spirit of his men prevail ; they clear the street in a triumphant style , but even a they do so the others issue again out of the house , and take them , a third time , upon the rear .
The Yorkists begin to be scatter ; several time Dick find himself alone among his foe and ply his bright sword for life ; several time he be conscious of a hurt .
And meanwhile the fight sway to and fro in the street without determinate result .
Suddenly Dick be aware of a great trumpeting about the outskirt of the town .
The war-cry of York begin to be roll up to heaven , a by many and triumphant voice .
And at the same time the men in front of him begin to give ground rapidly , stream out of the street and back upon the market-place .
Some one give the word to fly .
Trumpets be blow distractedly , some for a rally , some to charge .
It be plain that a great blow have be strike , and the Lancastrians be throw , at least for the moment , into full disorder , and some degree of panic .
And then , like a theatre trick , there follow the last act of Shoreby Battle .
The men in front of Richard turn tail , like a dog that have be whistle home , and flee like the wind .
At the same moment there come through the market-place a storm of horseman , flee and pursuing , the Lancastrians turn back to strike with the sword , the Yorkists rid them down at the point of the lance .
Conspicuous in the mellay , Dick behold the Crookback .
He be already give a foretaste of that furious valour and skill to cut his way across the rank of war , which , year afterwards upon the field of Bosworth , and when he be stain with crime , almost suffice to change the fortune of the day and the destiny of the English throne .
Evading , strike , rid down , he so forced and so manoeuvre his strong horse , so aptly defend himself , and so liberally scattered death to his opponent , that he be now far ahead of the foremost of his knight , hew his way , with the truncheon of a bloody sword , to where Lord Risingham be rally the brave .
A moment more and they have meet ; the tall , splendid , and famous warrior against the deformed and sickly boy .
Yet Shelton have never a doubt of the result ; and when the fight next open for a moment , the figure of the earl have disappear ; but still , in the first of the danger , Crookback Dick be launch his big horse and ply the truncheon of his sword .
Thus , by Shelton 's courage in hold the mouth of the street against the first attack , and by the opportune arrival of his seven hundred reinforcement , the lad , who be afterwards to be hand down to the execration of posterity under the name of Richard III . , have win his first considerable fight .
CHAPTER IV -- THE SACK OF SHOREBY There be not a foe leave within striking distance ; and Dick , a he look ruefully about him on the remainder of his gallant force , begin to count the cost of victory .
He be himself , now that the danger be end , so stiff and sore , so bruise and cut and break , and , above all , so utterly exhaust by his desperate and unremitting labour in the fight , that he seem incapable of any fresh exertion .
But this be not yet the hour for repose .
Shoreby have be take by assault ; and though an open town , and not in any manner to be charge with the resistance , it be plain that these rough fighter would be not less rough now that the fight be over , and that the more horrid part of war would fall to be enact .
Richard of Gloucester be not the captain to protect the citizen from his infuriated soldiery ; and even if he have the will , it might be question if he have the power .
It be , therefore , Dick 's business to find and to protect Joanna ; and with that end he look about him at the face of his men .
The three or four who seem likeliest to be obedient and to keep sober he draw aside ; and promise them a rich reward and a special recommendation to the duke , lead them across the market-place , now empty of horseman , and into the street upon the further side .
Every here and there small combat of from two to a dozen still rag upon the open street ; here and there a house be be besiege , the defender throw out stool and table on the head of the assailant .
The snow be strew with arm and corps ; but except for these partial combat the street be desert , and the house , some stand open , and some shutter and barricade , have for the most part cease to give out smoke .
Dick , thread the skirt of these skirmisher , lead his follower briskly in the direction of the abbey church ; but when he come the length of the main street , a cry of horror break from his lip .
Sir Daniel 's great house have be carry by assault .
The gate hang in splinter from the hinge , and a double throng keep pour in and out through the entrance , seek and carry booty .
Meanwhile , in the upper storey , some resistance be still be offer to the pillager ; for just a Dick come within eyeshot of the building , a casement be burst open from within , and a poor wretch in murrey and blue , scream and resist , be force through the embrasure and toss into the street below .
The most sickening apprehension fell upon Dick .
He run forward like one possess , force his way into the house among the foremost , and mount without pause to the chamber on the third floor where he have last part from Joanna .
It be a mere wreck ; the furniture have be overthrow , the cupboard break open , and in one place a trail corner of the arras lay smoulder on the ember of the fire .
Dick , almost without thinking , tread out the incipient conflagration , and then stand bewilder .
Sir Daniel , Sir Oliver , Joanna , all be go ; but whether butcher in the rout or safe escape from Shoreby , who should say ?
He catch a passing archer by the tabard .
`` Fellow , '' he ask , `` be ye here when this house be take ? ''
`` Let be , '' say the archer .
`` A murrain !
let be , or I strike . ''
`` Hark ye , '' return Richard , `` two can play at that .
Stand and be plain . ''
But the man , flush with drink and battle , strike Dick upon the shoulder with one hand , while with the other he twitch away his garment .
Thereupon the full wrath of the young leader burst from his control .
He seize the fellow in his strong embrace , and crush him on the plate of his mailed bosom like a child ; then , hold him at arm 's length , he bid him speak a he value life .
`` I pray you mercy ! ''
gasp the archer .
`` An I have think ye be so angry I would ` a ' be chary of cross you .
I be here indeed . ''
`` Know ye Sir Daniel ? ''
pursue Dick .
`` Well do I know him , '' return the man .
`` Was he in the mansion ? ''
`` Ay , sir , he be , '' answer the archer ; `` but even a we enter by the yard gate he ride forth by the garden . ''
`` Alone ? ''
cry Dick .
`` He may ` a ' have a score of lance with him , '' say the man .
`` Lances !
No woman , then ? ''
ask Shelton .
`` Troth , I saw not , '' say the archer .
`` But there be none in the house , if that be your quest . ''
`` I thank you , '' say Dick .
`` Here be a piece for your pain . ''
But grope in his wallet , Dick find nothing .
`` Inquire for me to-morrow , '' he add -- `` Richard Shelt -- Sir Richard Shelton , '' he correct , `` and I will see you handsomely reward . ''
And then an idea strike Dick .
He hastily descend to the courtyard , ran with all his might across the garden , and come to the great door of the church .
It stand wide open ; within , every corner of the pavement be crowd with fugitive burgher , surround by their family and laden with the most precious of their possession , while , at the high altar , priest in full canonicals be implore the mercy of God .
Even a Dick enter , the loud chorus begin to thunder in the vaulted roof .
He hurry through the group of refugee , and come to the door of the stair that lead into the steeple .
And here a tall churchman step before him and arrest his advance .
`` Whither , my son ? ''
he ask , severely .
`` My father , '' answer Dick , `` I be here upon an errand of expedition .
Stay me not .
I command here for my Lord of Gloucester . ''
`` For my Lord of Gloucester ? ''
repeat the priest .
`` Hath , then , the battle go so sore ? ''
`` The battle , father , be at an end , Lancaster clean speed , my Lord of Risingham -- Heaven rest him !
-- leave upon the field .
And now , with your good leave , I follow mine affair . ''
And thrust on one side the priest , who seem stupefy at the news , Dick push open the door and rattle up the stair four at a bound , and without pause or stumble , till he step upon the open platform at the top .
Shoreby Church tower not only command the town , a in a map , but look far , on both side , over sea and land .
It be now near upon noon ; the day exceed bright , the snow dazzling .
And a Dick look around him , he could measure the consequence of the battle .
A confused , growl uproar reach him from the street , and now and then , but very rarely , the clash of steel .
Not a ship , not so much a a skiff remain in harbour ; but the sea be dot with sail and row-boats laden with fugitive .
On shore , too , the surface of the snowy meadow be break up with band of horseman , some cut their way towards the border of the forest , others , who be doubtless of the Yorkist side , stoutly interpose and beat them back upon the town .
Over all the open ground there lay a prodigious quantity of fall men and horse , clearly define upon the snow .
To complete the picture , those of the foot soldier a have not find place upon a ship still keep up an archery combat on the border of the port , and from the cover of the shoreside tavern .
In that quarter , also , one or two house have be fire , and the smoke tower high in the frosty sunlight , and blow off to sea in voluminous fold .
Already close upon the margin of the wood , and somewhat in the line of Holywood , one particular clump of flee horseman rivet the attention of the young watcher on the tower .
It be fairly numerous ; in no other quarter of the field do so many Lancastrians still hold together ; thus they have leave a wide , discoloured wake upon the snow , and Dick be able to trace them step by step from where they have leave the town .
While Dick stand watch them , they have gain , unopposed , the first fringe of the leafless forest , and , turn a little from their direction , the sun fell for a moment full on their array , a it be relieve against the dusky wood .
`` Murrey and blue ! ''
cry Dick .
`` I swear it -- murrey and blue ! ''
The next moment he be descend the stairway .
It be now his business to seek out the Duke of Gloucester , who alone , in the disorder of the force , might be able to supply him with a sufficiency of men .
The fighting in the main town be now practically at an end ; and a Dick run hither and thither , seek the commander , the street be thick with wander soldier , some laden with more booty than they could well stagger under , others shout drunk .
None of them , when question , have the least notion of the duke 's whereabouts ; and , at last , it be by sheer good fortune that Dick find him , where he sit in the saddle direct operation to dislodge the archer from the harbour side .
`` Sir Richard Shelton , ye be well find , '' he say .
`` I owe you one thing that I value little , my life ; and one that I can never pay you for , this victory .
Catesby , if I have ten such captain a Sir Richard , I would march forthright on London .
But now , sir , claim your reward . ''
`` Freely , my lord , '' say Dick , `` freely and loudly .
One hath escape to whom I owe some grudge , and take with him one whom I owe love and service .
Give me , then , fifty lance , that I may pursue ; and for any obligation that your graciousness be please to allow , it shall be clean discharge . ''
`` How call ye him ? ''
inquire the duke .
`` Sir Daniel Brackley , '' answer Richard .
`` Out upon him , double-face ! ''
cry Gloucester .
`` Here be no reward , Sir Richard ; here be fresh service offer , and , if that ye bring his head to me , a fresh debt upon my conscience .
Catesby , get him these lance ; and you , sir , bethink ye , in the meanwhile , what pleasure , honour , or profit it shall be mine to give you . ''
Just then the Yorkist skirmisher carry one of the shoreside taverns , swarm in upon it on three side , and drive out or take it defender .
Crookback Dick be pleased to cheer the exploit , and push his horse a little nearer , call to see the prisoner .
There be four or five of them -- two men of my Lord Shoreby 's and one of Lord Risingham 's among the number , and last , but in Dick 's eye not least , a tall , shamble , grizzle old shipman , between drunk and sober , and with a dog whimpering and jumping at his heel .
The young duke pass them for a moment under a severe review .
`` Good , '' he say .
`` Hang them . ''
And he turn the other way to watch the progress of the fight .
`` My lord , '' say Dick , `` so please you , I have find my reward .
Grant me the life and liberty of yon old shipman . ''
Gloucester turn and look the speaker in the face .
`` Sir Richard , '' he say , `` I make not war with peacock 's feather , but steel shaft .
Those that be mine enemy I slay , and that without excuse or favour .
For , bethink ye , in this realm of England , that be so torn in piece , there be not a man of mine but hath a brother or a friend upon the other party .
If , then , I do begin to grant these pardon , I might sheathe my sword . ''
`` It may be so , my lord ; and yet I will be overbold , and at the risk of your disfavour , recall your lordship 's promise , '' reply Dick .
Richard of Gloucester flush .
`` Mark it right well , '' he say , harshly .
`` I love not mercy , nor yet mercymongers .
Ye have this day lay the foundation of high fortune .
If ye oppose to me my word , which I have plight , I will yield .
But , by the glory of heaven , there your favour die !
`` Mine be the loss , '' say Dick .
`` Give him his sailor , '' say the duke ; and wheel his horse , he turn his back upon young Shelton .
Dick be nor glad nor sorry .
He have see too much of the young duke to set great store on his affection ; and the origin and growth of his own favour have be too flimsy and too rapid to inspire much confidence .
One thing alone he fear -- that the vindictive leader might revoke the offer of the lance .
But here he do justice neither to Gloucester 's honour -LRB- such a it be -RRB- nor , above all , to his decision .
If he have once judge Dick to be the right man to pursue Sir Daniel , he be not one to change ; and he soon prove it by shout after Catesby to be speedy , for the paladin be wait .
In the meanwhile , Dick turn to the old shipman , who have seem equally indifferent to his condemnation and to his subsequent release .
`` Arblaster , '' say Dick , `` I have do you ill ; but now , by the rood , I think I have clear the score . ''
But the old skipper only look upon him dully and hold his peace .
`` Come , '' continue Dick , `` a life be a life , old shrew , and it be more than ship or liquor .
Say ye forgive me ; for if your life be worth nothing to you , it hath cost me the beginning of my fortune .
Come , I have pay for it dearly ; be not so churlish . ''
`` An I have have my ship , '' say Arblaster , `` I would ` a ' be forth and safe on the high sea -- I and my man Tom .
But ye take my ship , gossip , and I 'm a beggar ; and for my man Tom , a knave fellow in russet shot him down .
` Murrain ! '
quoth he , and spake never again .
` Murrain ' be the last of his word , and the poor spirit of him pass . '
A will never sail no more , will my Tom . ' ''
Dick be seize with unavailing penitence and pity ; he seek to take the skipper 's hand , but Arblaster avoid his touch .
`` Nay , '' say he , `` let be .
Y ' have play the devil with me , and let that content you . ''
The word die in Richard 's throat .
He saw , through tear , the poor old man , bemuse with liquor and sorrow , go shamble away , with bow head , across the snow , and the unnoticed dog whimper at his heel , and for the first time begin to understand the desperate game that we play in life ; and how a thing once do be not to be change or remedied , by any penitence .
But there be no time leave to him for vain regret .
Catesby have now collect the horseman , and rid up to Dick he dismount , and offer him his own horse .
`` This morning , '' he say , `` I be somewhat jealous of your favour ; it hath not be of a long growth ; and now , Sir Richard , it be with a very good heart that I offer you this horse -- to ride away with . ''
`` Suffer me yet a moment , '' reply Dick .
`` This favour of mine -- whereupon be it found ? ''
`` Upon your name , '' answer Catesby .
`` It be my lord 's chief superstition .
Were my name Richard , I should be an earl to-morrow . ''
`` Well , sir , I thank you , '' return Dick ; `` and since I be little likely to follow these great fortune , I will even say farewell .
I will not pretend I be displease to think myself upon the road to fortune ; but I will not pretend , neither , that I be over-sorry to be do with it .
Command and rich , they be brave thing , to be sure ; but a word in your ear -- yon duke of yours , he be a fearsome lad . ''
Catesby laugh .
`` Nay , '' say he , `` of a verity he that rid with Crooked Dick will ride deep .
Well , God keep u all from evil !
Speed ye well . ''
Thereupon Dick put himself at the head of his men , and give the word of command , ride off .
He make straight across the town , follow what he suppose to be the route of Sir Daniel , and spy around for any sign that might decide if he be right .
The street be strew with the dead and the wounded , whose fate , in the bitter frost , be far the more pitiable .
Gangs of the victor go from house to house , pillage and stabbing , and sometimes sing together a they go .
From different quarter , a he ride on , the sound of violence and outrage come to young Shelton 's ear ; now the blow of the sledge-hammer on some barricaded door , and now the miserable shriek of woman .
Dick 's heart have just be awaken .
He have just see the cruel consequence of his own behaviour ; and the thought of the sum of misery that be now act in the whole of Shoreby fill him with despair .
At length he reach the outskirt , and there , sure enough , he saw straight before him the same broad , beaten track across the snow that he have mark from the summit of the church .
Here , then , he go the faster on ; but still , a he ride , he keep a bright eye upon the fall men and horse that lay beside the track .
Many of these , he be relieve to see , wear Sir Daniel 's colour , and the face of some , who lay upon their back , he even recognise .
About half-way between the town and the forest , those whom he be follow have plainly be assail by archer ; for the corps lay pretty closely scattered , each pierce by an arrow .
And here Dick spy among the rest the body of a very young lad , whose face be somehow hauntingly familiar to him .
He halt his troop , dismount , and raise the lad 's head .
As he do so , the hood fell back , and a profusion of long brown hair unroll itself .
At the same time the eye open .
`` Ah !
lion driver ! ''
say a feeble voice .
`` She be far on .
Ride -- ride fast ! ''
And then the poor young lady faint once again .
One of Dick 's men carry a flask of some strong cordial , and with this Dick succeed in revive consciousness .
Then he take Joanna 's friend upon his saddlebow , and once more pushed toward the forest .
`` Why do ye take me ? ''
say the girl .
`` Ye but delay your speed . ''
`` Nay , Mistress Risingham , '' reply Dick .
`` Shoreby be full of blood and drunkenness and riot .
Here ye be safe ; content ye . ''
`` I will not be behold to any of your faction , '' she cry ; `` set me down . ''
`` Madam , ye know not what ye say , '' return Dick .
`` Y ' be hurt '' -- `` I be not , '' she say .
`` It be my horse be slay . ''
`` It matter not one jot , '' reply Richard .
`` Ye be here in the midst of open snow , and compass about with enemy .
Whether ye will or not , I carry you with me .
Glad be I to have the occasion ; for thus shall I repay some portion of our debt . ''
For a little while she be silent .
Then , very suddenly , she ask : `` My uncle ? ''
`` My Lord Risingham ? ''
return Dick .
`` I would I have good news to give you , madam ; but I have none .
I saw him once in the battle , and once only .
Let u hope the best . ''
CHAPTER V -- NIGHT IN THE WOODS : ALICIA RISINGHAM It be almost certain that Sir Daniel have make for the Moat House ; but , consider the heavy snow , the lateness of the hour , and the necessity under which he would lie of avoid the few road and strike across the wood , it be equally certain that he could not hope to reach it ere the morrow .
There be two course open to Dick ; either to continue to follow in the knight 's trail , and , if he be able , to fall upon him that very night in camp , or to strike out a path of his own , and seek to place himself between Sir Daniel and his destination .
Either scheme be open to serious objection , and Dick , who fear to expose Joanna to the hazard of a fight , have not yet decide between them when he reach the border of the wood .
At this point Sir Daniel have turn a little to his left , and then plunge straight under a grove of very lofty timber .
His party have then form to a narrow front , in order to pass between the tree , and the track be tread proportionally deeply in the snow .
The eye follow it under the leafless tracery of the oak , run direct and narrow ; the tree stand over it , with knotty joint and the great , uplifted forest of their bough ; there be no sound , whether of man or beast -- not so much a the stirring of a robin ; and over the field of snow the winter sun lay golden among netted shadow .
`` How say ye , '' ask Dick of one of the men , `` to follow straight on , or strike across for Tunstall ? ''
`` Sir Richard , '' reply the man-at-arms , `` I would follow the line until they scatter . ''
`` Ye be , doubtless , right , '' return Dick ; `` but we come right hastily upon the errand , even a the time command .
Here be no house , neither for food nor shelter , and by the morrow 's dawn we shall know both cold finger and an empty belly .
How say ye , lad ?
Will ye stand a pinch for expedition 's sake , or shall we turn by Holywood and sup with Mother Church ?
The case be somewhat doubtful , I will drive no man ; yet if ye would suffer me to lead you , ye would choose the first . ''
The men answer , almost with one voice , that they would follow Sir Richard where he would .
And Dick , set spur to his horse , begin once more to go forward .
The snow in the trail have be trodden very hard , and the pursuer have thus a great advantage over the pursued .
They push on , indeed , at a round trot , two hundred hoof beat alternately on the dull pavement of the snow , and the jingle of weapon and the snorting of horse raise a warlike noise along the arch of the silent wood .
Presently , the wide slot of the pursued come out upon the high road from Holywood ; it be there , for a moment , indistinguishable ; and , where it once more plunged into the unbeaten snow upon the farther side , Dick be surprise to see it narrow and light trod .
Plainly , profit by the road , Sir Daniel have begin already to scatter his command .
At all hazard , one chance be equal to another , Dick continue to pursue the straight trail ; and that , after an hour 's riding , in which it lead into the very depths of the forest , suddenly split , like a bursting shell , into two dozen others , lead to every point of the compass .
Dick draw bridle in despair .
The short winter 's day be near an end ; the sun , a dull red orange , shorn of ray , swam low among the leafless thicket ; the shadow be a mile long upon the snow ; the frost bit cruelly at the finger-nails ; and the breath and steam of the horse mount in a cloud .
`` Well , we be outwit , '' Dick confess .
`` Strike we for Holywood , after all .
It be still near u than Tunstall -- or should be by the station of the sun . ''
So they wheel to their left , turn their back on the red shield of sun , and make across country for the abbey .
But now time be change with them ; they could no longer spank forth briskly on a path beat firm by the passage of their foe , and for a goal to which that path itself conduct them .
Now they must plough at a dull pace through the encumbering snow , continually pause to decide their course , continually flounder in drift .
The sun soon leave them ; the glow of the west decayed ; and presently they be wander in a shadow of blackness , under frosty star .
Presently , indeed , the moon would clear the hilltop , and they might resume their march .
But till then , every random step might carry them wide of their march .
There be nothing for it but to camp and wait .
Sentries be post ; a spot of ground be clear of snow , and , after some failure , a good fire blaze in the midst .
The man-at-arms sit close about this forest hearth , share such provision a they have , and pass about the flask ; and Dick , have collect the most delicate of the rough and scanty fare , bring it to Lord Risingham 's niece , where she sit apart from the soldiery against a tree .
She sit upon one horse-cloth , wrap in another , and star straight before her at the firelit scene .
At the offer of food she start , like one waken from a dream , and then silently refuse .
`` Madam , '' say Dick , `` let me beseech you , punish me not so cruelly .
Wherein I have offend you , I know not ; I have , indeed , carry you away , but with a friendly violence ; I have , indeed , expose you to the inclemency of night , but the hurry that lie upon me hath for it end the preservation of another , who be no less frail and no less unfriended than yourself .
At least , madam , punish not yourself ; and eat , if not for hunger , then for strength . ''
`` I will eat nothing at the hand that slew my kinsman , '' she reply .
`` Dear madam , '' Dick cry , `` I swear to you upon the rood I touch him not . ''
`` Swear to me that he still live , '' she return .
`` I will not palter with you , '' answer Dick .
`` Pity bid me to wind you .
In my heart I do believe him dead . ''
`` And ye ask me to eat ! ''
she cry .
`` Ay , and they call you ` sir ! '
Y ' have win your spur by my good kinsman 's murder .
And have I not be fool and traitor both , and save you in your enemy 's house , ye should have die the death , and he -- he that be worth twelve of you -- be live . ''
`` I do but my man 's best , even a your kinsman do upon the other party , '' answer Dick .
`` Were he still live -- a I vow to Heaven I wish it !
-- he would praise , not blame me . ''
`` Sir Daniel hath tell me , '' she reply .
`` He mark you at the barricade .
Upon you , he saith , their party founder ; it be you that win the battle .
Well , then , it be you that kill my good Lord Risingham , as sure a though ye have strangle him .
And ye would have me eat with you -- and your hand not wash from kill ?
But Sir Daniel hath swear your downfall .
He 't be that will avenge me ! ''
The unfortunate Dick be plunge in gloom .
Old Arblaster return upon his mind , and he groan aloud .
`` Do ye hold me so guilty ? ''
he say ; `` you that defend me -- you that be Joanna 's friend ? ''
`` What make ye in the battle ? ''
she retort .
`` Y ' be of no party ; y ' be but a lad -- but legs and body , without government of wit or counsel !
Wherefore do ye fight ?
For the love of hurt , pardy ! ''
`` Nay , '' cry Dick , `` I know not .
But a the realm of England go , if that a poor gentleman fight not upon the one side , perforce he must fight upon the other .
He may not stand alone ; 't be not in nature . ''
`` They that have no judgment should not draw the sword , '' reply the young lady .
`` Ye that fight but for a hazard , what be ye but a butcher ?
War be but noble by the cause , and y ' have disgrace it . ''
`` Madam , '' say the miserable Dick , `` I do partly see mine error .
I have make too much haste ; I have be busy before my time .
Already I steal a ship -- thinking , I do swear it , to do well -- and thereby bring about the death of many innocent , and the grief and ruin of a poor old man whose face this very day hath stab me like a dagger .
And for this morning , I do but design to do myself credit , and get fame to marry with , and , behold !
I have bring about the death of your dear kinsman that be good to me .
And what besides , I know not .
For , ala !
I may have set York upon the throne , and that may be the worser cause , and may do hurt to England .
O , madam , I do see my sin .
I be unfit for life .
I will , for penance sake and to avoid bad evil , once I have finish this adventure , get me to a cloister .
I will forswear Joanna and the trade of arm .
I will be a friar , and pray for your good kinsman 's spirit all my day . ''
It appear to Dick , in this extremity of his humiliation and repentance , that the young lady have laugh .
Raising his countenance , he find her look down upon him , in the fire-light , with a somewhat peculiar but not unkind expression .
`` Madam , '' he cry , think the laughter to have be an illusion of his hearing , but still , from her change look , hop to have touch her heart , `` madam , will not this content you ?
I give up all to undo what I have do amiss ; I make heaven certain for Lord Risingham .
And all this upon the very day that I have win my spur , and think myself the happy young gentleman on ground . ''
`` O boy , '' she say -- `` good boy ! ''
And then , to the extreme surprise of Dick , she first very tenderly wipe the tear away from his cheek , and then , a if yielding to a sudden impulse , throw both her arm about his neck , draw up his face , and kiss him .
A pitiful bewilderment come over simple-minded Dick .
`` But come , '' she say , with great cheerfulness , `` you that be a captain , ye must eat .
Why sup ye not ? ''
`` Dear Mistress Risingham , '' reply Dick , `` I do but wait first upon my prisoner ; but , to say truth , penitence will no longer suffer me to endure the sight of food .
I be good to fast , dear lady , and to pray . ''
`` Call me Alicia , '' she say ; `` be we not old friend ?
And now , come , I will eat with you , bite for bit and sup for sup ; so if ye eat not , neither will I ; but if ye eat hearty , I will dine like a ploughman . ''
So there and then she fell to ; and Dick , who have an excellent stomach , proceed to bear her company , at first with great reluctance , but gradually , a he enter into the spirit , with more and more vigour and devotion : until , at last , he forget even to watch his model , and most heartily repair the expense of his day of labour and excitement .
`` Lion-driver , '' she say , at length , `` ye do not admire a maid in a man 's jerkin ? ''
The moon be now up ; and they be only wait to repose the wearied horse .
By the moon 's light , the still penitent but now well-fed Richard behold her look somewhat coquettishly down upon him .
`` Madam '' -- he stammer , surprise at this new turn in her manner .
`` Nay , '' she interrupt , `` it skills not to deny ; Joanna hath tell me , but come , Sir Lion-driver , look at me -- be I so homely -- come ! ''
And she make bright eye at him .
`` Ye be something smallish , indeed '' -- begin Dick .
And here again she interrupt him , this time with a ring peal of laughter that complete his confusion and surprise .
`` Smallish ! ''
she cry .
`` Nay , now , be honest a ye be bold ; I be a dwarf , or little good ; but for all that -- come , tell me !
-- for all that , passably fair to look upon ; be ' t not so ? ''
`` Nay , madam , exceedingly fair , '' say the distressed knight , pitifully try to seem easy .
`` And a man would be right glad to wed me ? ''
she pursue .
`` O , madam , right glad ! ''
agree Dick .
`` Call me Alicia , '' say she .
`` Alicia , '' quoth Sir Richard .
`` Well , then , lion-driver , '' she continue , `` sith that ye slew my kinsman , and leave me without stay , ye owe me , in honour , every reparation ; do ye not ? ''
`` I do , madam , '' say Dick .
`` Although , upon my heart , I do hold me but partially guilty of that brave knight 's blood . ''
`` Would ye evade me ? ''
she cry .
`` Madam , not so .
I have tell you ; at your bidding , I will even turn me a monk , '' say Richard .
`` Then , in honour , ye belong to me ? ''
she conclude .
`` In honour , madam , I suppose '' -- begin the young man .
`` Go to ! ''
she interrupt ; `` ye be too full of catch .
In honour do ye belong to me , till ye have pay the evil ? ''
`` In honour , I do , '' say Dick .
`` Hear , then , '' she continue ; `` Ye would make but a sad friar , methinks ; and since I be to dispose of you at pleasure , I will even take you for my husband .
Nay , now , no word ! ''
cry she .
`` They will avail you nothing .
For see how just it be , that you who deprive me of one home , should supply me with another .
And a for Joanna , she will be the first , believe me , to commend the change ; for , after all , a we be dear friend , what matter it with which of u ye wed ?
Not one whit ! ''
`` Madam , '' say Dick , `` I will go into a cloister , an ye please to bid me ; but to wed with anyone in this big world besides Joanna Sedley be what I will consent to neither for man 's force nor yet for lady 's pleasure .
Pardon me if I speak my plain thought plainly ; but where a maid be very bold , a poor man must even be the bolder . ''
`` Dick , '' she say , `` ye sweet boy , ye must come and kiss me for that word .
Nay , fear not , ye shall kiss me for Joanna ; and when we meet , I shall give it back to her , and say I steal it .
And a for what ye owe me , why , dear simpleton , methinks ye be not alone in that great battle ; and even if York be on the throne , it be not you that set him there .
But for a good , sweet , honest heart , Dick , y ' be all that ; and if I could find it in my soul to envy your Joanna anything , I would even envy her your love . ''
CHAPTER VI -- NIGHT IN THE WOODS -LRB- conclude -RRB- : DICK AND JOAN The horse have by this time finish the small store of provender , and fully breathe from their fatigue .
At Dick 's command , the fire be smother in snow ; and while his men get once more wearily to saddle , he himself , remember , somewhat late , true woodland caution , choose a tall oak and nimbly clamber to the topmost fork .
Hence he could look far abroad on the moonlit and snow-paven forest .
On the south-west , dark against the horizon , stand those upland , heathy quarter where he and Joanna have meet with the terrify misadventure of the leper .
And there his eye be catch by a spot of ruddy brightness no big than a needle 's eye .
He blame himself sharply for his previous neglect .
Were that , a it appear to be , the shining of Sir Daniel 's camp-fire , he should long ago have see and march for it ; above all , he should , for no consideration , have announce his neighbourhood by light a fire of his own .
But now he must no longer squander valuable hour .
The direct way to the upland be about two mile in length ; but it be cross by a very deep , precipitous dingle , impassable to mount men ; and for the sake of speed , it seem to Dick advisable to desert the horse and attempt the adventure on foot .
Ten men be leave to guard the horse ; signal be agree upon by which they could communicate in case of need ; and Dick set forth at the head of the remainder , Alicia Risingham walk stoutly by his side .
The men have free themselves of heavy armour , and leave behind their lance ; and they now march with a very good spirit in the frozen snow , and under the exhilarate lustre of the moon .
The descent into the dingle , where a stream strain sob through the snow and ice , be effect with silence and order ; and on the further side , be then within a short half mile of where Dick have see the glimmer of the fire , the party halt to breathe before the attack .
In the vast silence of the wood , the light sound be audible from far ; and Alicia , who be keen of hearing , hold up her finger warningly and stoop to listen .
All follow her example ; but besides the groan of the choked brook in the dingle close behind , and the barking of a fox at a distance of many mile among the forest , to Dick 's acute hearkening , not a breath be audible .
`` But yet , for sure , I hear the clash of harness , '' whisper Alicia .
`` Madam , '' return Dick , who be more afraid of that young lady than of ten stout warrior , `` I would not hint ye be mistake ; but it might well have come from either of the camp . ''
`` It come not thence .
It come from westward , '' she declare .
`` It may be what it will , '' return Dick ; `` and it must be a heaven please .
Reck we not a jot , but push on the livelier , and put it to the touch .
Up , friend -- enough breathe . ''
As they advance , the snow become more and more trampled with hoof-mark , and it be plain that they be draw near to the encampment of a considerable force of mount men .
Presently they could see the smoke pour from among the tree , ruddily colour on it low edge and scatter bright spark .
And here , pursuant to Dick 's order , his men begin to open out , creep stealthily in the covert , to surround on every side the camp of their opponent .
He himself , place Alicia in the shelter of a bulky oak , stole straight forth in the direction of the fire .
At last , through an opening of the wood , his eye embrace the scene of the encampment .
The fire have be build upon a heathy hummock of the ground , surround on three side by thicket , and it now burn very strong , roar aloud and brandishing flame .
Around it there sit not quite a dozen people , warmly cloak ; but though the neighbouring snow be trample down as by a regiment , Dick look in vain for any horse .
He begin to have a terrible misgiving that he be out-manoeuvred .
At the same time , in a tall man with a steel salet , who be spread his hand before the blaze , he recognise his old friend and still kindly enemy , Bennet Hatch ; and in two others , sit a little back , he make out , even in their male disguise , Joanna Sedley and Sir Daniel 's wife .
`` Well , '' think he to himself , `` even if I lose my horse , let me get my Joanna , and why should I complain ? ''
And then , from the further side of the encampment , there come a little whistle , announce that his men have join , and the investment be complete .
Bennet , at the sound , start to his foot ; but ere he have time to spring upon his arm , Dick hail him .
`` Bennet , '' he say -- `` Bennet , old friend , yield ye .
Ye will but spill men 's life in vain , if ye resist . '' ''
'T be Master Shelton , by St. Barbary ! ''
cry Hatch .
`` Yield me ?
Ye ask much .
What force have ye ? ''
`` I tell you , Bennet , ye be both outnumbered and begirt , '' say Dick .
`` Caesar and Charlemagne would cry for quarter .
I have two score men at my whistle , and with one shoot of arrow I could answer for you all . ''
`` Master Dick , '' say Bennet , `` it go against my heart ; but I must do my duty .
The saint help you ! ''
And therewith he raise a little tucket to his mouth and wind a rouse call .
Then follow a moment of confusion ; for while Dick , fear for the lady , still hesitate to give the word to shoot , Hatch 's little band sprang to their weapon and form back to back a for a fierce resistance .
In the hurry of their change of place , Joanna sprang from her seat and ran like an arrow to her lover 's side .
`` Here , Dick ! ''
she cry , a she clasp his hand in hers .
But Dick still stand irresolute ; he be yet young to the more deplorable necessity of war , and the thought of old Lady Brackley check the command upon his tongue .
His own men become restive .
Some of them cry on him by name ; others , of their own accord , begin to shoot ; and at the first discharge poor Bennet bit the dust .
Then Dick awoke .
`` On ! ''
he cry .
`` Shoot , boy , and keep to cover .
England and York ! ''
But just then the dull beat of many horse on the snow suddenly arise in the hollow ear of the night , and , with incredible swiftness , draw near and swell louder .
At the same time , answer tucket repeat and repeat Hatch 's call .
`` Rally , rally ! ''
cry Dick .
`` Rally upon me !
Rally for your life ! ''
But his men -- afoot , scatter , take in the hour when they have count on an easy triumph -- begin instead to give ground severally , and either stand waver or disperse into the thicket .
And when the first of the horseman come charge through the open avenue and fiercely rid their steed into the underwood , a few straggler be overthrown or spear among the brush , but the bulk of Dick 's command have simply melt at the rumour of their coming .
Dick stand for a moment , bitterly recognise the fruit of his precipitate and unwise valour .
Sir Daniel have see the fire ; he have move out with his main force , whether to attack his pursuer or to take them in the rear if they should venture the assault .
His have be throughout the part of a sagacious captain ; Dick 's the conduct of an eager boy .
And here be the young knight , his sweetheart , indeed , hold him tightly by the hand , but otherwise alone , his whole command of men and horse disperse in the night and the wide forest , like a paper of pin in a bay barn .
`` The saint enlighten me ! ''
he think .
`` It be well I be knight for this morning 's matter ; this doth me little honour . ''
And thereupon , still hold Joanna , he begin to run .
The silence of the night be now shatter by the shout of the men of Tunstall , a they gallop hither and thither , hunt fugitive ; and Dick break boldly through the underwood and run straight before him like a deer .
The silver clearness of the moon upon the open snow increase , by contrast , the obscurity of the thicket ; and the extreme dispersion of the vanquished lead the pursuer into wildly divergent path .
Hence , in but a little while , Dick and Joanna pause , in a close covert , and hear the sound of the pursuit , scatter abroad , indeed , in all direction , but yet faint already in the distance .
`` An I have but keep a reserve of them together , '' Dick cry , bitterly , `` I could have turn the table yet !
Well , we live and learn ; next time it shall go well , by the rood . ''
`` Nay , Dick , '' say Joanna , `` what matter it ?
Here we be together once again . ''
He look at her , and there she be -- John Matcham , a of yore , in hose and doublet .
But now he know her ; now , even in that ungainly dress , she smile upon him , bright with love ; and his heart be transport with joy .
`` Sweetheart , '' he say , `` if ye forgive this blunderer , what care I ?
Make we direct for Holywood ; there lieth your good guardian and my good friend , Lord Foxham .
There shall we be wed ; and whether poor or wealthy , famous or unknown , what , matter it ?
This day , dear love , I win my spur ; I be commend by great men for my valour ; I think myself the goodly man of war in all broad England .
Then , first , I fell out of my favour with the great ; and now have I be well thrash , and clean lose my soldier .
There be a downfall for conceit !
But , dear , I care not -- dear , if ye still love me and will wed , I would have my knighthood do away , and mind it not a jot . ''
`` My Dick ! ''
she cry .
`` And do they knight you ? ''
`` Ay , dear , ye be my lady now , '' he answer , fondly ; `` or ye shall , ere noon to-morrow -- will ye not ? ''
`` That will I , Dick , with a glad heart , '' she answer .
`` Ay , sir ?
Methought ye be to be a monk ! ''
say a voice in their ear .
`` Alicia ! ''
cry Joanna .
`` Even so , '' reply the young lady , come forward .
`` Alicia , whom ye leave for dead , and whom your lion-driver found , and bring to life again , and , by my sooth , make love to , if ye want to know ! ''
`` I 'll not believe it , '' cry Joanna .
`` Dick ! ''
`` Dick ! ''
mimic Alicia .
`` Dick , indeed !
Ay , fair sir , and ye desert poor damsel in distress , '' she continue , turn to the young knight .
`` Ye leave them plant behind oak .
But they say true -- the age of chivalry be dead . ''
`` Madam , '' cry Dick , in despair , `` upon my soul I have forget you outright .
Madam , ye must try to pardon me .
Ye see , I have new find Joanna ! ''
`` I do not suppose that ye have do it o ' purpose , '' she retort .
`` But I will be cruelly avenge .
I will tell a secret to my Lady Shelton -- she that be to be , '' she add , curtsey .
`` Joanna , '' she continue , `` I believe , upon my soul , your sweetheart be a bold fellow in a fight , but he be , let me tell you plainly , the softest-hearted simpleton in England .
Go to -- ye may do your pleasure with him !
And now , fool child , first kiss me , either one of you , for luck and kindness ; and then kiss each other just one minute by the glass , and not one second longer ; and then let u all three set forth for Holywood as fast a we can stir ; for these wood , methinks , be full of peril and exceed cold . ''
`` But do my Dick make love to you ? ''
ask Joanna , cling to her sweetheart 's side .
`` Nay , fool girl , '' return Alicia ; `` it be I make love to him .
I offer to marry him , indeed ; but he bid me go marry with my like .
These be his word .
Nay , that I will say : he be more plain than pleasant .
But now , child , for the sake of sense , set forward .
Shall we go once more over the dingle , or push straight for Holywood ? ''
`` Why , '' say Dick , `` I would like dearly to get upon a horse ; for I have be sore mauled and beaten , one way and another , these last day , and my poor body be one bruise .
But how think ye ?
If the men , upon the alarm of the fighting , have flee away , we should have go about for nothing .
'T be but some three short mile to Holywood direct ; the bell hath not beat nine ; the snow be pretty firm to walk upon , the moon clear ; how if we go even a we be ? ''
`` Agreed , '' cry Alicia ; but Joanna only press upon Dick 's arm .
Forth , then , they go , through open leafless grove and down snow-clad alley , under the white face of the winter moon ; Dick and Joanna walk hand in hand and in a heaven of pleasure ; and their light-minded companion , her own bereavement heartily forget , follow a pace or two behind , now rally them upon their silence , and now draw happy picture of their future and united life .
Still , indeed , in the distance of the wood , the rider of Tunstall might be hear urge their pursuit ; and from time to time cry or the clash of steel announce the shock of enemy .
But in these young folk , breed among the alarm of war , and fresh from such a multiplicity of danger , neither fear nor pity could be lightly waken .
Content to find the sound still draw far and far away , they give up their heart to the enjoyment of the hour , walk already , a Alicia put it , in a wedding procession ; and neither the rude solitude of the forest , nor the cold of the freezing night , have any force to shadow or distract their happiness .
At length , from a rise hill , they look below them on the dell of Holywood .
The great window of the forest abbey shone with torch and candle ; it high pinnacle and spire arise very clear and silent , and the gold rood upon the topmost summit glitter brightly in the moon .
All about it , in the open glade , camp-fires be burn , and the ground be thick with hut ; and across the midst of the picture the frozen river curve .
`` By the mass , '' say Richard , `` there be Lord Foxham 's fellow still encamp .
The messenger hath certainly miscarry .
Well , then , so well .
We have power at hand to face Sir Daniel . ''
But if Lord Foxham 's men still lay encamp in the long holm at Holywood , it be from a different reason from the one suppose by Dick .
They have march , indeed , for Shoreby ; but ere they be half way thither , a second messenger meet them , and bid them return to their morning 's camp , to bar the road against Lancastrian fugitive , and to be so much nearer to the main army of York .
For Richard of Gloucester , have finish the battle and stamp out his foe in that district , be already on the march to rejoin his brother ; and not long after the return of my Lord Foxham 's retainer , Crookback himself draw rein before the abbey door .
It be in honour of this august visitor that the window shone with light ; and at the hour of Dick 's arrival with his sweetheart and her friend , the whole ducal party be be entertain in the refectory with the splendour of that powerful and luxurious monastery .
Dick , not quite with his good will , be bring before them .
Gloucester , sick with fatigue , sit lean upon one hand his white and terrifying countenance ; Lord Foxham , half recover from his wound , be in a place of honour on his left .
`` How , sir ? ''
ask Richard .
`` Have ye bring me Sir Daniel 's head ? ''
`` My lord duke , '' reply Dick , stoutly enough , but with a qualm at heart , `` I have not even the good fortune to return with my command .
I have be , so please your grace , well beaten . ''
Gloucester look upon him with a formidable frown .
`` I give you fifty lance , -LCB- 3 -RCB- sir , '' he say .
`` My lord duke , I have but fifty man-at-arms , '' reply the young knight .
`` How be this ? ''
say Gloucester .
`` He do ask me fifty lance . ''
`` May it please your grace , '' reply Catesby , smoothly , `` for a pursuit we give him but the horseman . ''
`` It be well , '' reply Richard , add , `` Shelton , ye may go . ''
`` Stay ! ''
say Lord Foxham .
`` This young man likewise have a charge from me .
It may be he hath good sped .
Say , Master Shelton , have ye find the maid ? ''
`` I praise the saint , my lord , '' say Dick , `` she be in this house . ''
`` Is it even so ?
Well , then , my lord the duke , '' resume Lord Foxham , `` with your good will , to-morrow , before the army march , I do propose a marriage .
This young squire -- '' `` Young knight , '' interrupt Catesby .
`` Say ye so , Sir William ? ''
cry Lord Foxham .
`` I do myself , and for good service , dub him knight , '' say Gloucester .
`` He hath twice manfully serve me .
It be not valour of hand , it be a man 's mind of iron , that he lack .
He will not rise , Lord Foxham .
'T be a fellow that will fight indeed bravely in a mellay , but hath a capon 's heart .
Howbeit , if he be to marry , marry him in the name of Mary , and be do ! ''
`` Nay , he be a brave lad -- I know it , '' say Lord Foxham .
`` Content ye , then , Sir Richard .
I have compound this affair with Master Hamley , and to-morrow ye shall wed. '' Whereupon Dick judge it prudent to withdraw ; but he be not yet clear of the refectory , when a man , but newly alight at the gate , come run four stair at a bound , and , brush through the abbey servant , throw himself on one knee before the duke .
`` Victory , my lord , '' he cry .
And before Dick have get to the chamber set apart for him a Lord Foxham 's guest , the troop in the holm be cheer around their fire ; for upon that same day , not twenty mile away , a second crushing blow have be deal to the power of Lancaster .
CHAPTER VII -- DICK 'S REVENGE The next morning Dick be afoot before the sun , and have dress himself to the best advantage with the aid of the Lord Foxham 's baggage , and get good report of Joan , he set forth on foot to walk away his impatience .
For some while he make round among the soldiery , who be get to arm in the wintry twilight of the dawn and by the red glow of torch ; but gradually he stroll further afield , and at length pass clean beyond the outpost , and walk alone in the frozen forest , wait for the sun .
His thought be both quiet and happy .
His brief favour with the Duke he could not find it in his heart to mourn ; with Joan to wife , and my Lord Foxham for a faithful patron , he look most happily upon the future ; and in the past he find but little to regret .
As he thus stroll and ponder , the solemn light of the morning grow more clear , the east be already colour by the sun , and a little scathing wind blow up the frozen snow .
He turn to go home ; but even a he turn , his eye light upon a figure behind , a tree .
`` Stand ! ''
he cry .
`` Who go ? ''
The figure step forth and wave it hand like a dumb person .
It be array like a pilgrim , the hood lower over the face , but Dick , in an instant , recognise Sir Daniel .
He stride up to him , draw his sword ; and the knight , put his hand in his bosom , a if to seize a hidden weapon , steadfastly await his approach .
`` Well , Dickon , '' say Sir Daniel , `` how be it to be ?
Do ye make war upon the fall ? ''
`` I make no war upon your life , '' reply the lad ; `` I be your true friend until ye sought for mine ; but ye have seek for it greedily . ''
`` Nay -- self-defence , '' reply the knight .
`` And now , boy , the news of this battle , and the presence of yon crook devil here in mine own wood , have break me beyond all help .
I go to Holywood for sanctuary ; thence overseas , with what I can carry , and to begin life again in Burgundy or France . ''
`` Ye may not go to Holywood , '' say Dick .
`` How !
May not ? ''
ask the knight .
`` Look ye , Sir Daniel , this be my marriage morn , '' say Dick ; `` and yon sun that be to rise will make the bright day that ever shone for me .
Your life be forfeit -- doubly forfeit , for my father 's death and your own practice to meward .
But I myself have do amiss ; I have bring about men 's death ; and upon this glad day I will be neither judge nor hangman .
An ye be the devil , I would not lay a hand on you .
An ye be the devil , ye might go where ye will for me .
Seek God 's forgiveness ; mine ye have freely .
But to go on to Holywood be different .
I carry arm for York , and I will suffer no spy within their line .
Hold it , then , for certain , if ye set one foot before another , I will uplift my voice and call the near post to seize you . ''
`` Ye mock me , '' say Sir Daniel .
`` I have no safety out of Holywood . ''
`` I care no more , '' return Richard .
`` I let you go east , west , or south ; north I will not .
Holywood be shut against you .
Go , and seek not to return .
For , once ye be go , I will warn every post about this army , and there will be so shrewd a watch upon all pilgrim that , once again , be ye the very devil , ye would find it ruin to make the essay . ''
`` Ye doom me , '' say Sir Daniel , gloomily .
`` I doom you not , '' return Richard .
`` If it so please you to set your valour against mine , come on ; and though I fear it be disloyal to my party , I will take the challenge openly and fully , fight you with mine own single strength , and call for none to help me .
So shall I avenge my father , with a perfect conscience . ''
`` Ay , '' say Sir Daniel , `` y ' have a long sword against my dagger . ''
`` I rely upon Heaven only , '' answer Dick , cast his sword some way behind him on the snow .
`` Now , if your ill-fate bid you , come ; and , under the pleasure of the Almighty , I make myself bold to fee your bone to fox . ''
`` I do but try you , Dickon , '' return the knight , with an uneasy semblance of a laugh .
`` I would not spill your blood . ''
`` Go , then , ere it be too late , '' reply Shelton .
`` In five minute I will call the post .
I do perceive that I be too long-suffering .
Had but our place be reverse , I should have be bind hand and foot some minute past . ''
`` Well , Dickon , I will go , '' reply Sir Daniel .
`` When we next meet , it shall repent you that ye be so harsh . ''
And with these word , the knight turn and begin to move off under the tree .
Dick watch him with strangely-mingled feeling , a he go , swiftly and warily , and ever and again turn a wicked eye upon the lad who have spar him , and whom he still suspect .
There be upon one side of where he go a thicket , strongly mat with green ivy , and , even in it winter state , impervious to the eye .
Herein , all of a sudden , a bow sound like a note of music .
An arrow fly , and with a great , choke cry of agony and anger , the Knight of Tunstall throw up his hand and fell forward in the snow .
Dick bound to his side and raise him .
His face desperately work ; his whole body be shake by contort spasm .
`` Is the arrow black ? ''
he gasp .
`` It be black , '' reply Dick , gravely .
And then , before he could add one word , a desperate seizure of pain shake the wounded man from head to foot , so that his body leap in Dick 's support arm , and with the extremity of that pang his spirit flee in silence .
The young man lay him back gently on the snow and prayed for that unprepared and guilty spirit , and a he pray the sun come up at a bound , and the robin begin chirp in the ivy .
When he rise to his foot , he find another man upon his knee but a few step behind him , and , still with uncovered head , he wait until that prayer also should be over .
It take long ; the man , with his head bow and his face cover with his hand , pray like one in a great disorder or distress of mind ; and by the bow that lay beside him , Dick judge that he be no other than the archer who have lay Sir Daniel low .
At length he , also , rise , and show the countenance of Ellis Duckworth .
`` Richard , '' he say , very gravely , `` I hear you .
Ye take the good part and pardon ; I take the worse , and there lie the clay of mine enemy .
Pray for me . ''
And he wring him by the hand .
`` Sir , '' say Richard , `` I will pray for you , indeed ; though how I may prevail I wot not .
But if ye have so long pursued revenge , and find it now of such a sorry flavour , bethink ye , be it not well to pardon others ?
Hatch -- he be dead , poor shrew !
I would have spar a good ; and for Sir Daniel , here lie his body .
But for the priest , if I might anywise prevail , I would have you let him go . ''
A flash come into the eye of Ellis Duckworth .
`` Nay , '' he say , `` the devil be still strong within me .
But be at rest ; the Black Arrow flieth nevermore -- the fellowship be break .
They that still live shall come to their quiet and ripe end , in Heaven 's good time , for me ; and for yourself , go where your good fortune call you , and think no more of Ellis . ''
CHAPTER VIII -- CONCLUSION About nine in the morning , Lord Foxham be lead his ward , once more dressed a befit her sex , and follow by Alicia Risingham , to the church of Holywood , when Richard Crookback , his brow already heavy with care , cross their path and pause .
`` Is this the maid ? ''
he ask ; and when Lord Foxham have reply in the affirmative , `` Minion , '' he add , `` hold up your face until I see it favour . ''
He look upon her sourly for a little .
`` Ye be fair , '' he say at last , `` and , a they tell me , dower .
How if I offer you a brave marriage , a become your face and parentage ? ''
`` My lord duke , '' reply Joanna , `` may it please your grace , I have rather wed with Sir Richard . ''
`` How so ? ''
he ask , harshly .
`` Marry but the man I name to you , and he shall be my lord , and you my lady , before night .
For Sir Richard , let me tell you plainly , he will die Sir Richard . ''
`` I ask no more of Heaven , my lord , than but to die Sir Richard 's wife , '' return Joanna .
`` Look ye at that , my lord , '' say Gloucester , turn to Lord Foxham .
`` Here be a pair for you .
The lad , when for good service I give him his choice of my favour , choose but the grace of an old , drunken shipman .
I do warn him freely , but he be stout in his besottedness .
` Here dieth your favour , ' say I ; and he , my lord , with a most assured impertinence , ` Mine be the loss , ' quoth he .
It shall be so , by the rood ! ''
`` Said he so ? ''
cry Alicia .
`` Then well say , lion-driver ! ''
`` Who be this ? ''
ask the duke .
`` A prisoner of Sir Richard 's , '' answer Lord Foxham ; `` Mistress Alicia Risingham . ''
`` See that she be marry to a sure man , '' say the duke .
`` I have think of my kinsman , Hamley , an it like your grace , '' return Lord Foxham .
`` He hath well serve the cause . ''
`` It like me well , '' say Richard .
`` Let them be wed speedily .
Say , fair maid , will you wed ? ''
`` My lord duke , '' say Alicia , `` so a the man be straight '' -- And there , in a perfect consternation , the voice die on her tongue .
`` He be straight , my mistress , '' reply Richard , calmly .
`` I be the only crookback of my party ; we be else passably well shapen .
Ladies , and you , my lord , '' he add , with a sudden change to grave courtesy , `` judge me not too churlish if I leave you .
A captain , in the time of war , hath not the ordering of his hour . ''
And with a very handsome salutation he pass on , follow by his officer .
`` Alack , '' cry Alicia , `` I be shent ! ''
`` Ye know him not , '' reply Lord Foxham .
`` It be but a trifle ; he hath already clean forgot your word . ''
`` He be , then , the very flower of knighthood , '' say Alicia .
`` Nay , he but mindeth other thing , '' return Lord Foxham .
`` Tarry we no more . ''
In the chancel they find Dick wait , attend by a few young men ; and there be he and Joan unite .
When they come forth again , happy and yet serious , into the frosty air and sunlight , the long file of the army be already wind forward up the road ; already the Duke of Gloucester 's banner be unfolded and begin to move from before the abbey in a clump of spear ; and behind it , gird by steel-clad knight , the bold , black-hearted , and ambitious hunchback move on towards his brief kingdom and his lasting infamy .
But the wedding party turn upon the other side , and sit down , with sober merriment , to breakfast .
The father cellarer attend on their want , and sit with them at table .
Hamley , all jealousy forget , begin to ply the nowise loth Alicia with courtship .
And there , amid the sounding of tucket and the clash of armoured soldiery and horse continually move forth , Dick and Joan sit side by side , tenderly hold hand , and look , with ever grow affection , in each other 's eye .
Thenceforth the dust and blood of that unruly epoch pass them by .
They dwell apart from alarm in the green forest where their love begin .
Two old men in the meanwhile enjoyed pension in great prosperity and peace , and with perhaps a superfluity of ale and wine , in Tunstall hamlet .
One have be all his life a shipman , and continue to the last to lament his man Tom .
The other , who have be a bit of everything , turn in the end towards piety , and make a most religious death under the name of Brother Honestus in the neighbouring abbey .
So Lawless have his will , and die a friar .

_BOOK_TITLE_ : Robert_Louis_Stevenson___Treasure_Island.txt.out
PART ONE -- The Old Buccaneer 1 The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow SQUIRE TRELAWNEY , Dr. Livesey , and the rest of these gentleman have ask me to write down the whole particular about Treasure Island , from the beginning to the end , keep nothing back but the bearing of the island , and that only because there be still treasure not yet lift , I take up my pen in the year of grace 17 __ and go back to the time when my father keep the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first take up his lodge under our roof .
I remember him a if it be yesterday , a he come plod to the inn door , his sea-chest follow behind him in a hand-barrow -- a tall , strong , heavy , nut-brown man , his tarry pigtail fall over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat , his hand rag and scar , with black , broken nail , and the sabre cut across one cheek , a dirty , livid white .
I remember him look round the cover and whistle to himself a he do so , and then break out in that old sea-song that he sing so often afterwards : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''
in the high , old tottering voice that seem to have be tune and break at the capstan bar .
Then he rap on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carry , and when my father appear , call roughly for a glass of rum .
This , when it be bring to him , he drink slowly , like a connoisseur , linger on the taste and still look about him at the cliff and up at our signboard .
`` This be a handy cove , '' say he at length ; `` and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop .
Much company , mate ? ''
My father tell him no , very little company , the more be the pity .
`` Well , then , '' say he , `` this be the berth for me .
Here you , matey , '' he cry to the man who trundle the barrow ; `` bring up alongside and help up my chest .
I 'll stay here a bit , '' he continue .
`` I 'm a plain man ; rum and bacon and egg be what I want , and that head up there for to watch ship off .
What you mought call me ?
You mought call me captain .
Oh , I see what you 're at -- there '' ; and he throw down three or four gold piece on the threshold .
`` You can tell me when I 've work through that , '' say he , look as fierce a a commander .
And indeed bad a his clothes be and coarsely a he speak , he have none of the appearance of a man who sail before the mast , but seem like a mate or skipper accustom to be obey or to strike .
The man who come with the barrow tell u the mail have set him down the morning before at the Royal George , that he have inquire what inn there be along the coast , and hearing ours well spoken of , I suppose , and describe a lonely , have choose it from the others for his place of residence .
And that be all we could learn of our guest .
He be a very silent man by custom .
All day he hang round the cove or upon the cliff with a brass telescope ; all evening he sit in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong .
Mostly he would not speak when spoken to , only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog-horn ; and we and the people who come about our house soon learn to let him be .
Every day when he come back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men have go by along the road .
At first we think it be the want of company of his own kind that make him ask this question , but at last we begin to see he be desirous to avoid them .
When a seaman do put up at the Admiral Benbow -LRB- a now and then some do , make by the coast road for Bristol -RRB- he would look in at him through the curtained door before he enter the parlour ; and he be always sure to be as silent a a mouse when any such be present .
For me , at least , there be no secret about the matter , for I be , in a way , a sharer in his alarm .
He have take me aside one day and promise me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my `` weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg '' and let him know the moment he appear .
Often enough when the first of the month come round and I apply to him for my wage , he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down , but before the week be out he be sure to think good of it , bring me my four-penny piece , and repeat his order to look out for `` the seafaring man with one leg . ''
How that personage haunt my dream , I need scarcely tell you .
On stormy night , when the wind shake the four corner of the house and the surf roar along the cove and up the cliff , I would see him in a thousand form , and with a thousand diabolical expression .
Now the leg would be cut off at the knee , now at the hip ; now he be a monstrous kind of a creature who have never have but the one leg , and that in the middle of his body .
To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch be the bad of nightmare .
And altogether I pay pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece , in the shape of these abominable fancy .
But though I be so terrify by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg , I be far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who know him .
There be night when he take a deal more rum and water than his head would carry ; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked , old , wild sea-songs , mind nobody ; but sometimes he would call for glass round and force all the tremble company to listen to his story or bear a chorus to his singing .
Often I have hear the house shake with `` Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum , '' all the neighbour join in for dear life , with the fear of death upon them , and each sing loud than the other to avoid remark .
For in these fit he be the most overriding companion ever know ; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round ; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question , or sometimes because none be put , and so he judge the company be not follow his story .
Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he have drink himself sleepy and reel off to bed .
His story be what frightened people bad of all .
Dreadful story they be -- about hanging , and walk the plank , and storm at sea , and the Dry Tortugas , and wild deed and place on the Spanish Main .
By his own account he must have live his life among some of the wicked men that God ever allow upon the sea , and the language in which he tell these story shock our plain country people almost as much a the crime that he describe .
My father be always say the inn would be ruin , for people would soon cease come there to be tyrannize over and put down , and send shiver to their bed ; but I really believe his presence do u good .
People be frighten at the time , but on look back they rather like it ; it be a fine excitement in a quiet country life , and there be even a party of the young men who pretend to admire him , call him a `` true sea-dog '' and a `` real old salt '' and such like name , and say there be the sort of man that make England terrible at sea .
In one way , indeed , he bid fair to ruin u , for he keep on stay week after week , and at last month after month , so that all the money have be long exhaust , and still my father never pluck up the heart to insist on have more .
If ever he mention it , the captain blow through his nose so loudly that you might say he roar , and star my poor father out of the room .
I have see him wring his hand after such a rebuff , and I be sure the annoyance and the terror he live in must have greatly hasten his early and unhappy death .
All the time he live with u the captain make no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stocking from a hawker .
One of the cock of his hat have fall down , he let it hang from that day forth , though it be a great annoyance when it blow .
I remember the appearance of his coat , which he patch himself upstairs in his room , and which , before the end , be nothing but patch .
He never write or receive a letter , and he never speak with any but the neighbour , and with these , for the most part , only when drunk on rum .
The great sea-chest none of u have ever see open .
He be only once cross , and that be towards the end , when my poor father be far go in a decline that take him off .
Dr. Livesey come late one afternoon to see the patient , take a bit of dinner from my mother , and go into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet , for we have no stabling at the old Benbow .
I follow him in , and I remember observe the contrast the neat , bright doctor , with his powder as white a snow and his bright , black eye and pleasant manner , make with the coltish country folk , and above all , with that filthy , heavy , bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours , sit , far go in rum , with his arm on the table .
Suddenly he -- the captain , that be -- begin to pipe up his eternal song : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum !
Drink and the devil have do for the rest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''
At first I have suppose `` the dead man 's chest '' to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room , and the thought have be mingle in my nightmare with that of the one-legged seafaring man .
But by this time we have all long cease to pay any particular notice to the song ; it be new , that night , to nobody but Dr. Livesey , and on him I observe it do not produce an agreeable effect , for he look up for a moment quite angrily before he go on with his talk to old Taylor , the gardener , on a new cure for the rheumatic .
In the meantime , the captain gradually brighten up at his own music , and at last flap his hand upon the table before him in a way we all know to mean silence .
The voice stop at once , all but Dr. Livesey 's ; he go on a before speak clear and kind and draw briskly at his pipe between every word or two .
The captain glare at him for a while , flap his hand again , glare still hard , and at last break out with a villainous , low oath , `` Silence , there , between deck ! ''
`` Were you address me , sir ? ''
say the doctor ; and when the ruffian have tell him , with another oath , that this be so , `` I have only one thing to say to you , sir , '' reply the doctor , `` that if you keep on drinking rum , the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel ! ''
The old fellow 's fury be awful .
He spring to his foot , draw and open a sailor 's clasp-knife , and balance it open on the palm of his hand , threaten to pin the doctor to the wall .
The doctor never so much a move .
He speak to him a before , over his shoulder and in the same tone of voice , rather high , so that all the room might hear , but perfectly calm and steady : `` If you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket , I promise , upon my honour , you shall hang at the next assize . ''
Then follow a battle of look between them , but the captain soon knuckle under , put up his weapon , and resume his seat , grumble like a beaten dog .
`` And now , sir , '' continue the doctor , `` since I now know there 's such a fellow in my district , you may count I 'll have an eye upon you day and night .
I 'm not a doctor only ; I 'm a magistrate ; and if I catch a breath of complaint against you , if it 's only for a piece of incivility like tonight 's , I 'll take effectual mean to have you hunt down and rout out of this .
Let that suffice . ''
Soon after , Dr. Livesey 's horse come to the door and he ride away , but the captain hold his peace that evening , and for many evening to come .
2 Black Dog Appears and Disappears IT be not very long after this that there occur the first of the mysterious event that rid u at last of the captain , though not , a you will see , of his affair .
It be a bitter cold winter , with long , hard frost and heavy gale ; and it be plain from the first that my poor father be little likely to see the spring .
He sink daily , and my mother and I have all the inn upon our hand , and be keep busy enough without pay much regard to our unpleasant guest .
It be one January morning , very early -- a pinching , frosty morning -- the cove all grey with hoar-frost , the ripple lap softly on the stone , the sun still low and only touch the hilltop and shin far to seaward .
The captain have rise earlier than usual and set out down the beach , his cutlas swing under the broad skirt of the old blue coat , his brass telescope under his arm , his hat tilt back upon his head .
I remember his breath hang like smoke in his wake a he stride off , and the last sound I hear of him a he turn the big rock be a loud snort of indignation , a though his mind be still run upon Dr. Livesey .
Well , mother be upstairs with father and I be lay the breakfast-table against the captain 's return when the parlour door open and a man step in on whom I have never set my eye before .
He be a pale , tallowy creature , want two finger of the left hand , and though he wear a cutlas , he do not look much like a fighter .
I have always my eye open for seafaring men , with one leg or two , and I remember this one puzzle me .
He be not sailorly , and yet he have a smack of the sea about him too .
I ask him what be for his service , and he say he would take rum ; but a I be go out of the room to fetch it , he sit down upon a table and motion me to draw near .
I pause where I be , with my napkin in my hand .
`` Come here , sonny , '' say he .
`` Come nearer here . ''
I take a step nearer .
`` Is this here table for my mate Bill ? ''
he ask with a kind of leer .
I tell him I do not know his mate Bill , and this be for a person who stay in our house whom we call the captain .
`` Well , '' say he , `` my mate Bill would be call the captain , as like a not .
He have a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him , particularly in drink , have my mate Bill .
We 'll put it , for argument like , that your captain have a cut on one cheek -- and we 'll put it , if you like , that that cheek 's the right one .
Ah , well !
I tell you .
Now , be my mate Bill in this here house ? ''
I tell him he be out walking .
`` Which way , sonny ?
Which way be he go ? ''
And when I have point out the rock and tell him how the captain be likely to return , and how soon , and answer a few other question , `` Ah , '' say he , `` this 'll be as good a drink to my mate Bill . ''
The expression of his face a he say these word be not at all pleasant , and I have my own reason for think that the stranger be mistake , even suppose he mean what he say .
But it be no affair of mine , I think ; and besides , it be difficult to know what to do .
The stranger keep hang about just inside the inn door , peer round the corner like a cat wait for a mouse .
Once I step out myself into the road , but he immediately call me back , and a I do not obey quick enough for his fancy , a most horrible change come over his tallowy face , and he order me in with an oath that make me jump .
As soon a I be back again he return to his former manner , half fawning , half sneering , pat me on the shoulder , tell me I be a good boy and he have take quite a fancy to me .
`` I have a son of my own , '' say he , `` a like you a two block , and he 's all the pride of my ` art .
But the great thing for boy be discipline , sonny -- discipline .
Now , if you have sail along of Bill , you would n't have stand there to be speak to twice -- not you .
That be never Bill 's way , nor the way of sich a sail with him .
And here , sure enough , be my mate Bill , with a spy-glass under his arm , bless his old ` art , to be sure .
You and me 'll just go back into the parlour , sonny , and get behind the door , and we 'll give Bill a little surprise -- bless his ` art , I say again . ''
So say , the stranger back along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we be both hide by the open door .
I be very uneasy and alarmed , a you may fancy , and it rather add to my fear to observe that the stranger be certainly frighten himself .
He clear the hilt of his cutlas and loosen the blade in the sheath ; and all the time we be wait there he keep swallow a if he felt what we use to call a lump in the throat .
At last in strode the captain , slam the door behind him , without look to the right or leave , and march straight across the room to where his breakfast await him .
`` Bill , '' say the stranger in a voice that I think he have try to make bold and big .
The captain spun round on his heel and front u ; all the brown have go out of his face , and even his nose be blue ; he have the look of a man who see a ghost , or the evil one , or something bad , if anything can be ; and upon my word , I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick .
`` Come , Bill , you know me ; you know an old shipmate , Bill , surely , '' say the stranger .
The captain make a sort of gasp .
`` Black Dog ! ''
say he .
`` And who else ? ''
return the other , get more at his ease .
`` Black Dog a ever be , come for to see his old shipmate Billy , at the Admiral Benbow inn .
Ah , Bill , Bill , we have see a sight of time , u two , since I lose them two talon , '' hold up his mutilated hand .
`` Now , look here , '' say the captain ; `` you 've run me down ; here I be ; well , then , speak up ; what be it ? ''
`` That 's you , Bill , '' return Black Dog , `` you 're in the right of it , Billy .
I 'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here , a I 've take such a liking to ; and we 'll sit down , if you please , and talk square , like old shipmate . ''
When I return with the rum , they be already seat on either side of the captain 's breakfast-table -- Black Dog next to the door and sit sideways so a to have one eye on his old shipmate and one , a I think , on his retreat .
He bid me go and leave the door wide open .
`` None of your keyhole for me , sonny , '' he say ; and I leave them together and retire into the bar .
For a long time , though I certainly do my best to listen , I could hear nothing but a low gattling ; but at last the voice begin to grow high , and I could pick up a word or two , mostly oaths , from the captain .
`` No , no , no , no ; and an end of it ! ''
he cry once .
And again , `` If it come to swing , swing all , say I. '' Then all of a sudden there be a tremendous explosion of oath and other noise -- the chair and table go over in a lump , a clash of steel follow , and then a cry of pain , and the next instant I saw Black Dog in full flight , and the captain hotly pursue , both with drawn cutlass , and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder .
Just at the door the captain aim at the fugitive one last tremendous cut , which would certainly have split him to the chine have it not be intercept by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow .
You may see the notch on the low side of the frame to this day .
That blow be the last of the battle .
Once out upon the road , Black Dog , in spite of his wound , show a wonderful clean pair of heel and disappear over the edge of the hill in half a minute .
The captain , for his part , stand star at the signboard like a bewildered man .
Then he pass his hand over his eye several time and at last turn back into the house .
`` Jim , '' say he , `` rum '' ; and a he speak , he reel a little , and catch himself with one hand against the wall .
`` Are you hurt ? ''
cry I . `` Rum , '' he repeat .
`` I must get away from here .
Rum !
Rum ! ''
I run to fetch it , but I be quite unsteadied by all that have fall out , and I break one glass and foul the tap , and while I be still get in my own way , I hear a loud fall in the parlour , and run in , behold the captain lie full length upon the floor .
At the same instant my mother , alarm by the cry and fighting , come run downstairs to help me .
Between u we raise his head .
He be breathe very loud and hard , but his eye be close and his face a horrible colour .
`` Dear , deary me , '' cry my mother , `` what a disgrace upon the house !
And your poor father sick ! ''
In the meantime , we have no idea what to do to help the captain , nor any other thought but that he have get his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger .
I get the rum , to be sure , and try to put it down his throat , but his teeth be tightly shut and his jaw as strong a iron .
It be a happy relief for u when the door open and Doctor Livesey come in , on his visit to my father .
`` Oh , doctor , '' we cry , `` what shall we do ?
Where be he wound ? ''
`` Wounded ?
A fiddle-stick 's end ! ''
say the doctor .
`` No more wounded than you or I .
The man have have a stroke , a I warn him .
Now , Mrs. Hawkins , just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him , if possible , nothing about it .
For my part , I must do my best to save this fellow 's trebly worthless life ; Jim , you get me a basin . ''
When I get back with the basin , the doctor have already rip up the captain 's sleeve and expose his great sinewy arm .
It be tattoo in several place .
`` Here 's luck , '' `` A fair wind , '' and `` Billy Bones his fancy , '' be very neatly and clearly execute on the forearm ; and up near the shoulder there be a sketch of a gallows and a man hang from it -- do , a I think , with great spirit .
`` Prophetic , '' say the doctor , touch this picture with his finger .
`` And now , Master Billy Bones , if that be your name , we 'll have a look at the colour of your blood .
Jim , '' he say , `` be you afraid of blood ? ''
`` No , sir , '' say I . `` Well , then , '' say he , `` you hold the basin '' ; and with that he take his lancet and open a vein .
A great deal of blood be take before the captain open his eye and look mistily about him .
First he recognize the doctor with an unmistakable frown ; then his glance fell upon me , and he look relieve .
But suddenly his colour change , and he try to raise himself , cry , `` Where 's Black Dog ? ''
`` There be no Black Dog here , '' say the doctor , `` except what you have on your own back .
You have be drink rum ; you have have a stroke , precisely a I tell you ; and I have just , very much against my own will , drag you headforemost out of the grave .
Now , Mr. Bones -- '' `` That 's not my name , '' he interrupt .
`` Much I care , '' return the doctor .
`` It 's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance ; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness , and what I have to say to you be this ; one glass of rum wo n't kill you , but if you take one you 'll take another and another , and I stake my wig if you do n't break off short , you 'll die -- do you understand that ?
-- die , and go to your own place , like the man in the Bible .
Come , now , make an effort .
I 'll help you to your bed for once . ''
Between u , with much trouble , we manage to hoist him upstairs , and lay him on his bed , where his head fell back on the pillow a if he be almost fainting .
`` Now , mind you , '' say the doctor , `` I clear my conscience -- the name of rum for you be death . ''
And with that he go off to see my father , take me with him by the arm .
`` This be nothing , '' he say as soon a he have close the door .
`` I have draw blood enough to keep him quiet awhile ; he should lie for a week where he be -- that be the best thing for him and you ; but another stroke would settle him . ''
3 The Black Spot ABOUT noon I stop at the captain 's door with some cool drink and medicine .
He be lie very much a we have leave him , only a little high , and he seem both weak and excite .
`` Jim , '' he say , `` you 're the only one here that 's worth anything , and you know I 've be always good to you .
Never a month but I 've give you a silver fourpenny for yourself .
And now you see , mate , I 'm pretty low , and desert by all ; and Jim , you 'll bring me one noggin of rum , now , wo n't you , matey ? ''
`` The doctor -- '' I begin .
But he break in curse the doctor , in a feeble voice but heartily .
`` Doctors be all swab , '' he say ; `` and that doctor there , why , what do he know about seafaring men ?
I be in place hot a pitch , and mat drop round with Yellow Jack , and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea with earthquake -- what to the doctor know of land like that ?
-- and I live on rum , I tell you .
It 's be meat and drink , and man and wife , to me ; and if I 'm not to have my rum now I 'm a poor old hulk on a lee shore , my blood 'll be on you , Jim , and that doctor swab '' ; and he run on again for a while with curse .
`` Look , Jim , how my finger fidges , '' he continue in the plead tone .
`` I ca n't keep 'em still , not I. I have n't have a drop this bless day .
That doctor 's a fool , I tell you .
If I do n't have a drain o ' rum , Jim , I 'll have the horror ; I see some on 'em already .
I see old Flint in the corner there , behind you ; as plain a print , I see him ; and if I get the horror , I 'm a man that have live rough , and I 'll raise Cain .
Your doctor hisself say one glass would n't hurt me .
I 'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin , Jim . ''
He be grow more and more excited , and this alarm me for my father , who be very low that day and need quiet ; besides , I be reassure by the doctor 's word , now quote to me , and rather offend by the offer of a bribe .
`` I want none of your money , '' say I , `` but what you owe my father .
I 'll get you one glass , and no more . ''
When I bring it to him , he seize it greedily and drink it out .
`` Aye , aye , '' say he , `` that 's some good , sure enough .
And now , matey , do that doctor say how long I be to lie here in this old berth ? ''
`` A week at least , '' say I . `` Thunder ! ''
he cry .
`` A week !
I ca n't do that ; they 'd have the black spot on me by then .
The lubber be go about to get the wind of me this bless moment ; lubber a could n't keep what they get , and want to nail what be another 's .
Is that seamanly behaviour , now , I want to know ?
But I 'm a saving soul .
I never waste good money of mine , nor lose it neither ; and I 'll trick 'em again .
I 'm not afraid on 'em .
I 'll shake out another reef , matey , and daddle 'em again . ''
As he be thus speaking , he have rise from bed with great difficulty , hold to my shoulder with a grip that almost make me cry out , and move his leg like so much dead weight .
His word , spirit a they be in meaning , contrast sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they be utter .
He pause when he have get into a sit position on the edge .
`` That doctor 's do me , '' he murmur .
`` My ear be sing .
Lay me back . ''
Before I could do much to help him he have fall back again to his former place , where he lay for a while silent .
`` Jim , '' he say at length , `` you saw that seafaring man today ? ''
`` Black Dog ? ''
I ask .
`` Ah !
Black Dog , '' say he .
`` HE 'S a bad un ; but there 's bad that put him on .
Now , if I ca n't get away nohow , and they tip me the black spot , mind you , it 's my old sea-chest they 're after ; you get on a horse -- you can , ca n't you ?
Well , then , you get on a horse , and go to -- well , yes , I will !
-- to that eternal doctor swab , and tell him to pipe all hand -- magistrate and sich -- and he 'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow -- all old Flint 's crew , man and boy , all on 'em that 's leave .
I be first mate , I be , old Flint 's first mate , and I 'm the on ' y one a know the place .
He give it me at Savannah , when he lay a-dying , like a if I be to now , you see .
But you wo n't peach unless they get the black spot on me , or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg , Jim -- him above all . ''
`` But what be the black spot , captain ? ''
I ask .
`` That 's a summons , mate .
I 'll tell you if they get that .
But you keep your weather-eye open , Jim , and I 'll share with you equal , upon my honour . ''
He wander a little long , his voice grow weak ; but soon after I have give him his medicine , which he take like a child , with the remark , `` If ever a seaman want drug , it 's me , '' he fell at last into a heavy , swoon-like sleep , in which I leave him .
What I should have do have all go well I do not know .
Probably I should have tell the whole story to the doctor , for I be in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confession and make an end of me .
But a thing fell out , my poor father die quite suddenly that evening , which put all other matter on one side .
Our natural distress , the visit of the neighbour , the arranging of the funeral , and all the work of the inn to be carry on in the meanwhile keep me so busy that I have scarcely time to think of the captain , far less to be afraid of him .
He get downstairs next morning , to be sure , and have his meal a usual , though he eat little and have more , I be afraid , than his usual supply of rum , for he help himself out of the bar , scowl and blow through his nose , and no one dare to cross him .
On the night before the funeral he be as drunk a ever ; and it be shock , in that house of mourn , to hear him sing away at his ugly old sea-song ; but weak a he be , we be all in the fear of death for him , and the doctor be suddenly take up with a case many mile away and be never near the house after my father 's death .
I have say the captain be weak , and indeed he seem rather to grow weak than regain his strength .
He clamber up and down stair , and go from the parlour to the bar and back again , and sometimes put his nose out of door to smell the sea , hold on to the wall a he go for support and breathe hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain .
He never particularly address me , and it be my belief he have as good a forgotten his confidence ; but his temper be more flighty , and allow for his bodily weakness , more violent than ever .
He have an alarming way now when he be drunk of draw his cutlas and lay it bare before him on the table .
But with all that , he mind people less and seem shut up in his own thought and rather wandering .
Once , for instance , to our extreme wonder , he pip up to a different air , a kind of country love-song that he must have learn in his youth before he have begin to follow the sea .
So thing pass until , the day after the funeral , and about three o'clock of a bitter , foggy , frosty afternoon , I be stand at the door for a moment , full of sad thought about my father , when I saw someone draw slowly near along the road .
He be plainly blind , for he tap before him with a stick and wear a great green shade over his eye and nose ; and he be hunch , a if with age or weakness , and wear a huge old tattered sea-cloak with a hood that make him appear positively deform .
I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure .
He stop a little from the inn , and raise his voice in an odd sing-song , address the air in front of him , `` Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man , who have lose the precious sight of his eye in the gracious defence of his native country , England -- and God bless King George !
-- where or in what part of this country he may now be ? ''
`` You be at the Admiral Benbow , Black Hill Cove , my good man , '' say I . `` I hear a voice , '' say he , `` a young voice .
Will you give me your hand , my kind young friend , and lead me in ? ''
I hold out my hand , and the horrible , soft-spoken , eyeless creature grip it in a moment like a vise .
I be so much startle that I struggle to withdraw , but the blind man pull me close up to him with a single action of his arm .
`` Now , boy , '' he say , `` take me in to the captain . ''
`` Sir , '' say I , `` upon my word I dare not . ''
`` Oh , '' he sneer , `` that 's it !
Take me in straight or I 'll break your arm . ''
And he give it , a he speak , a wrench that make me cry out .
`` Sir , '' say I , `` it be for yourself I mean .
The captain be not what he use to be .
He sit with a drawn cutlas .
Another gentleman -- '' `` Come , now , march , '' interrupt he ; and I never hear a voice so cruel , and cold , and ugly a that blind man 's .
It cow me more than the pain , and I begin to obey him at once , walk straight in at the door and towards the parlour , where our sick old buccaneer be sit , daze with rum .
The blind man clung close to me , hold me in one iron fist and lean almost more of his weight on me than I could carry .
`` Lead me straight up to him , and when I 'm in view , cry out , ` Here 's a friend for you , Bill . '
If you do n't , I 'll do this , '' and with that he give me a twitch that I think would have make me faint .
Between this and that , I be so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forget my terror of the captain , and a I open the parlour door , cry out the word he have order in a trembling voice .
The poor captain raise his eye , and at one look the rum go out of him and leave him star sober .
The expression of his face be not so much of terror a of mortal sickness .
He make a movement to rise , but I do not believe he have enough force leave in his body .
`` Now , Bill , sit where you be , '' say the beggar .
`` If I ca n't see , I can hear a finger stirring .
Business be business .
Hold out your left hand .
Boy , take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right . ''
We both obey him to the letter , and I saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that hold his stick into the palm of the captain 's , which close upon it instantly .
`` And now that 's do , '' say the blind man ; and at the word he suddenly leave hold of me , and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness , skip out of the parlour and into the road , where , a I still stand motionless , I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance .
It be some time before either I or the captain seem to gather our sens , but at length , and about at the same moment , I release his wrist , which I be still hold , and he draw in his hand and look sharply into the palm .
`` Ten o'clock ! ''
he cry .
`` Six hour .
We 'll do them yet , '' and he spring to his foot .
Even a he do so , he reel , put his hand to his throat , stand sway for a moment , and then , with a peculiar sound , fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor .
I run to him at once , call to my mother .
But haste be all in vain .
The captain have be strike dead by thunder apoplexy .
It be a curious thing to understand , for I have certainly never like the man , though of late I have begin to pity him , but as soon a I saw that he be dead , I burst into a flood of tear .
It be the second death I have know , and the sorrow of the first be still fresh in my heart .
4 The Sea-chest I LOST no time , of course , in tell my mother all that I know , and perhaps should have tell her long before , and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous position .
Some of the man 's money -- if he have any -- be certainly due to u , but it be not likely that our captain 's shipmate , above all the two specimen see by me , Black Dog and the blind beggar , would be incline to give up their booty in payment of the dead man 's debt .
The captain 's order to mount at once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have leave my mother alone and unprotected , which be not to be think of .
Indeed , it seem impossible for either of u to remain much longer in the house ; the fall of coal in the kitchen grate , the very ticking of the clock , fill u with alarm .
The neighbourhood , to our ear , seem haunt by approach footstep ; and what between the dead body of the captain on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar hover near at hand and ready to return , there be moment when , a the saying go , I jump in my skin for terror .
Something must speedily be resolve upon , and it occur to u at last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet .
No sooner say than do .
Bare-headed a we be , we run out at once in the gathering evening and the frosty fog .
The hamlet lay not many hundred yard away , though out of view , on the other side of the next cove ; and what greatly encourage me , it be in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man have make his appearance and whither he have presumably return .
We be not many minute on the road , though we sometimes stop to lay hold of each other and hearken .
But there be no unusual sound -- nothing but the low wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmate of the wood .
It be already candle-light when we reach the hamlet , and I shall never forget how much I be cheer to see the yellow shine in door and window ; but that , a it prove , be the best of the help we be likely to get in that quarter .
For -- you would have think men would have be ashamed of themselves -- no soul would consent to return with u to the Admiral Benbow .
The more we tell of our trouble , the more -- man , woman , and child -- they cling to the shelter of their house .
The name of Captain Flint , though it be strange to me , be well enough know to some there and carry a great weight of terror .
Some of the men who have be to field-work on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remember , besides , to have see several stranger on the road , and take them to be smuggler , to have bolt away ; and one at least have see a little lugger in what we call Kitt 's Hole .
For that matter , anyone who be a comrade of the captain 's be enough to frighten them to death .
And the short and the long of the matter be , that while we could get several who be willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey 's , which lay in another direction , not one would help u to defend the inn .
They say cowardice be infectious ; but then argument be , on the other hand , a great emboldener ; and so when each have say his say , my mother make them a speech .
She would not , she declare , lose money that belong to her fatherless boy ; `` If none of the rest of you dare , '' she say , `` Jim and I dare .
Back we will go , the way we come , and small thanks to you big , hulking , chicken-hearted men .
We 'll have that chest open , if we die for it .
And I 'll thank you for that bag , Mrs. Crossley , to bring back our lawful money in . ''
Of course I say I would go with my mother , and of course they all cry out at our foolhardiness , but even then not a man would go along with u .
All they would do be to give me a loaded pistol l we be attack , and to promise to have horse ready saddle in case we be pursue on our return , while one lad be to ride forward to the doctor 's in search of armed assistance .
My heart be beat finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture .
A full moon be begin to rise and peer redly through the upper edge of the fog , and this increase our haste , for it be plain , before we come forth again , that all would be as bright a day , and our departure expose to the eye of any watcher .
We slip along the hedge , noiseless and swift , nor do we see or hear anything to increase our terror , till , to our relief , the door of the Admiral Benbow have close behind u .
I slip the bolt at once , and we stand and pant for a moment in the dark , alone in the house with the dead captain 's body .
Then my mother get a candle in the bar , and hold each other 's hand , we advance into the parlour .
He lay a we have leave him , on his back , with his eye open and one arm stretch out .
`` Draw down the blind , Jim , '' whisper my mother ; `` they might come and watch outside .
And now , '' say she when I have do so , `` we have to get the key off THAT ; and who 's to touch it , I should like to know ! ''
and she give a kind of sob a she say the word .
I go down on my knee at once .
On the floor close to his hand there be a little round of paper , blacken on the one side .
I could not doubt that this be the BLACK SPOT ; and take it up , I find write on the other side , in a very good , clear hand , this short message : `` You have till ten tonight . ''
`` He have till ten , Mother , '' say I ; and just a I say it , our old clock begin strike .
This sudden noise startle u shockingly ; but the news be good , for it be only six .
`` Now , Jim , '' she say , `` that key . ''
I felt in his pocket , one after another .
A few small coin , a thimble , and some thread and big needle , a piece of pigtail tobacco bite away at the end , his gully with the crooked handle , a pocket compass , and a tinder box be all that they contain , and I begin to despair .
`` Perhaps it 's round his neck , '' suggest my mother .
Overcoming a strong repugnance , I tear open his shirt at the neck , and there , sure enough , hang to a bit of tarry string , which I cut with his own gully , we find the key .
At this triumph we be fill with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he have sleep so long and where his box have stand since the day of his arrival .
It be like any other seaman 's chest on the outside , the initial `` B '' burn on the top of it with a hot iron , and the corner somewhat smash and break a by long , rough usage .
`` Give me the key , '' say my mother ; and though the lock be very stiff , she have turn it and throw back the lid in a twinkling .
A strong smell of tobacco and tar rise from the interior , but nothing be to be see on the top except a suit of very good clothes , carefully brush and fold .
They have never be wear , my mother say .
Under that , the miscellany begin -- a quadrant , a tin canikin , several stick of tobacco , two brace of very handsome pistol , a piece of bar silver , an old Spanish watch and some other trinket of little value and mostly of foreign make , a pair of compass mount with brass , and five or six curious West Indian shell .
I have often wonder since why he should have carry about these shell with him in his wandering , guilty , and hunt life .
In the meantime , we have find nothing of any value but the silver and the trinket , and neither of these be in our way .
Underneath there be an old boat-cloak , whiten with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar .
My mother pull it up with impatience , and there lay before u , the last thing in the chest , a bundle tie up in oilcloth , and look like paper , and a canvas bag that give forth , at a touch , the jingle of gold .
`` I 'll show these rogue that I 'm an honest woman , '' say my mother .
`` I 'll have my due , and not a farthing over .
Hold Mrs. Crossley 's bag . ''
And she begin to count over the amount of the captain 's score from the sailor 's bag into the one that I be hold .
It be a long , difficult business , for the coin be of all country and size -- doubloon , and louis d'ors , and guinea , and piece of eight , and I know not what besides , all shake together at random .
The guinea , too , be about the scarcest , and it be with these only that my mother know how to make her count .
When we be about half-way through , I suddenly put my hand upon her arm , for I have hear in the silent frosty air a sound that bring my heart into my mouth -- the tap-tapping of the blind man 's stick upon the frozen road .
It draw nearer and nearer , while we sit hold our breath .
Then it strike sharp on the inn door , and then we could hear the handle be turn and the bolt rattling a the wretched be try to enter ; and then there be a long time of silence both within and without .
At last the tapping recommence , and , to our indescribable joy and gratitude , die slowly away again until it cease to be hear .
`` Mother , '' say I , `` take the whole and let 's be go , '' for I be sure the bolted door must have seem suspicious and would bring the whole hornet 's nest about our ear , though how thankful I be that I have bolt it , none could tell who have never meet that terrible blind man .
But my mother , frighten a she be , would not consent to take a fraction more than be due to her and be obstinately unwilling to be content with less .
It be not yet seven , she say , by a long way ; she know her right and she would have them ; and she be still argue with me when a little low whistle sound a good way off upon the hill .
That be enough , and more than enough , for both of u .
`` I 'll take what I have , '' she say , jump to her foot .
`` And I 'll take this to square the count , '' say I , pick up the oilskin packet .
Next moment we be both grope downstairs , leave the candle by the empty chest ; and the next we have open the door and be in full retreat .
We have not start a moment too soon .
The fog be rapidly disperse ; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on either side ; and it be only in the exact bottom of the dell and round the tavern door that a thin veil still hang unbroken to conceal the first step of our escape .
Far less than half-way to the hamlet , very little beyond the bottom of the hill , we must come forth into the moonlight .
Nor be this all , for the sound of several footstep run come already to our ear , and a we look back in their direction , a light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advance show that one of the newcomer carry a lantern .
`` My dear , '' say my mother suddenly , `` take the money and run on .
I be go to faint . ''
This be certainly the end for both of u , I think .
How I curse the cowardice of the neighbour ; how I blame my poor mother for her honesty and her greed , for her past foolhardiness and present weakness !
We be just at the little bridge , by good fortune ; and I help her , totter a she be , to the edge of the bank , where , sure enough , she give a sigh and fell on my shoulder .
I do not know how I find the strength to do it at all , and I be afraid it be roughly do , but I manage to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch .
Farther I could not move her , for the bridge be too low to let me do more than crawl below it .
So there we have to stay -- my mother almost entirely expose and both of u within earshot of the inn .
5 The Last of the Blind Man MY curiosity , in a sense , be strong than my fear , for I could not remain where I be , but creep back to the bank again , whence , shelter my head behind a bush of broom , I might command the road before our door .
I be scarcely in position ere my enemy begin to arrive , seven or eight of them , run hard , their foot beat out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some pace in front .
Three men run together , hand in hand ; and I make out , even through the mist , that the middle man of this trio be the blind beggar .
The next moment his voice show me that I be right .
`` Down with the door ! ''
he cry .
`` Aye , aye , sir ! ''
answer two or three ; and a rush be make upon the Admiral Benbow , the lantern-bearer following ; and then I could see them pause , and hear speech pass in a low key , a if they be surprise to find the door open .
But the pause be brief , for the blind man again issue his command .
His voice sound louder and high , a if he be afire with eagerness and rage .
`` In , in , in ! ''
he shout , and curse them for their delay .
Four or five of them obey at once , two remain on the road with the formidable beggar .
There be a pause , then a cry of surprise , and then a voice shout from the house , `` Bill 's dead . ''
But the blind man swore at them again for their delay .
`` Search him , some of you shirk lubber , and the rest of you aloft and get the chest , '' he cry .
I could hear their foot rattle up our old stair , so that the house must have shook with it .
Promptly afterwards , fresh sound of astonishment arose ; the window of the captain 's room be throw open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass , and a man lean out into the moonlight , head and shoulder , and address the blind beggar on the road below him .
`` Pew , '' he cry , `` they 've be before u .
Someone 's turn the chest out alow and aloft . ''
`` Is it there ? ''
roar Pew .
`` The money 's there . ''
The blind man curse the money .
`` Flint 's fist , I mean , '' he cry .
`` We do n't see it here nohow , '' return the man .
`` Here , you below there , be it on Bill ? ''
cry the blind man again .
At that another fellow , probably him who have remain below to search the captain 's body , come to the door of the inn .
`` Bill 's be overhaul a ` ready , '' say he ; `` nothin ' left . ''
`` It 's these people of the inn -- it 's that boy .
I wish I have put his eye out ! ''
cry the blind man , Pew .
`` There be no time ago -- they have the door bolt when I try it .
Scatter , lads , and find 'em . ''
`` Sure enough , they leave their glim here , '' say the fellow from the window .
`` Scatter and find 'em !
Rout the house out ! ''
reiterate Pew , strike with his stick upon the road .
Then there follow a great to-do through all our old inn , heavy foot pound to and fro , furniture throw over , door kick in , until the very rocks re-echoed and the men come out again , one after another , on the road and declare that we be nowhere to be find .
And just the same whistle that have alarm my mother and myself over the dead captain 's money be once more clearly audible through the night , but this time twice repeat .
I have think it to be the blind man 's trumpet , so to speak , summon his crew to the assault , but I now find that it be a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet , and from it effect upon the buccaneer , a signal to warn them of approach danger .
`` There 's Dirk again , '' say one .
`` Twice !
We 'll have to budge , mate . ''
`` Budge , you skulk ! ''
cry Pew .
`` Dirk be a fool and a coward from the first -- you would n't mind him .
They must be close by ; they ca n't be far ; you have your hand on it .
Scatter and look for them , dog !
Oh , shiver my soul , '' he cry , `` if I have eye ! ''
This appeal seem to produce some effect , for two of the fellow begin to look here and there among the lumber , but half-heartedly , I think , and with half an eye to their own danger all the time , while the rest stand irresolute on the road .
`` You have your hand on thousand , you fool , and you hang a leg !
You 'd be as rich a king if you could find it , and you know it 's here , and you stand there skulk .
There be n't one of you dare face Bill , and I do it -- a blind man !
And I 'm to lose my chance for you !
I 'm to be a poor , crawl beggar , sponge for rum , when I might be roll in a coach !
If you have the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still . ''
`` Hang it , Pew , we 've get the doubloon ! ''
grumble one .
`` They might have hide the blessed thing , '' say another .
`` Take the Georges , Pew , and do n't stand here squall . ''
Squalling be the word for it ; Pew 's anger rise so high at these objection till at last , his passion completely take the upper hand , he strike at them right and leave in his blindness and his stick sound heavily on more than one .
These , in their turn , curse back at the blind miscreant , threaten him in horrid term , and try in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp .
This quarrel be the saving of u , for while it be still rag , another sound come from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet -- the tramp of horse gallop .
Almost at the same time a pistol-shot , flash and report , come from the hedge side .
And that be plainly the last signal of danger , for the buccaneer turn at once and run , separate in every direction , one seaward along the cove , one slant across the hill , and so on , so that in half a minute not a sign of them remain but Pew .
Him they have desert , whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill word and blow I know not ; but there he remain behind , tap up and down the road in a frenzy , and grope and call for his comrade .
Finally he take a wrong turn and run a few step past me , towards the hamlet , cry , `` Johnny , Black Dog , Dirk , '' and other name , `` you wo n't leave old Pew , mate -- not old Pew ! ''
Just then the noise of horse top the rise , and four or five rider come in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope .
At this Pew saw his error , turn with a scream , and run straight for the ditch , into which he roll .
But he be on his foot again in a second and make another dash , now utterly bewilder , right under the near of the come horse .
The rider try to save him , but in vain .
Down go Pew with a cry that ring high into the night ; and the four hoof trample and spurn him and pass by .
He fell on his side , then gently collapse upon his face and move no more .
I leap to my foot and hail the rider .
They be pull up , at any rate , horrify at the accident ; and I soon saw what they be .
One , tail out behind the rest , be a lad that have go from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey 's ; the rest be revenue officer , whom he have meet by the way , and with whom he have have the intelligence to return at once .
Some news of the lugger in Kitt 's Hole have find it way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction , and to that circumstance my mother and I owe our preservation from death .
Pew be dead , stone dead .
As for my mother , when we have carry her up to the hamlet , a little cold water and salt and that soon bring her back again , and she be none the worse for her terror , though she still continue to deplore the balance of the money .
In the meantime the supervisor rode on , a fast a he could , to Kitt 's Hole ; but his men have to dismount and grope down the dingle , leading , and sometimes support , their horse , and in continual fear of ambush ; so it be no great matter for surprise that when they get down to the Hole the lugger be already under way , though still close in .
He hail her .
A voice reply , tell him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him , and at the same time a bullet whistle close by his arm .
Soon after , the lugger double the point and disappear .
Mr. Dance stand there , a he say , `` like a fish out of water , '' and all he could do be to dispatch a man to B -- to warn the cutter .
`` And that , '' say he , `` be just about as good a nothing .
They 've get off clean , and there 's an end .
Only , '' he add , `` I 'm glad I tread on Master Pew 's corn , '' for by this time he have hear my story .
I go back with him to the Admiral Benbow , and you can not imagine a house in such a state of smash ; the very clock have be throw down by these fellow in their furious hunt after my mother and myself ; and though nothing have actually be take away except the captain 's money-bag and a little silver from the till , I could see at once that we be ruin .
Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene .
`` They get the money , you say ?
Well , then , Hawkins , what in fortune be they after ?
More money , I suppose ? ''
`` No , sir ; not money , I think , '' reply I . `` In fact , sir , I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket ; and to tell you the truth , I should like to get it put in safety . ''
`` To be sure , boy ; quite right , '' say he .
`` I 'll take it , if you like . ''
`` I think perhaps Dr. Livesey -- '' I begin .
`` Perfectly right , '' he interrupt very cheerily , `` perfectly right -- a gentleman and a magistrate .
And , now I come to think of it , I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire .
Master Pew 's dead , when all 's do ; not that I regret it , but he 's dead , you see , and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty 's revenue , if make it out they can .
Now , I 'll tell you , Hawkins , if you like , I 'll take you along . ''
I thank him heartily for the offer , and we walk back to the hamlet where the horse be .
By the time I have tell mother of my purpose they be all in the saddle .
`` Dogger , '' say Mr. Dance , `` you have a good horse ; take up this lad behind you . ''
As soon a I be mount , hold on to Dogger 's belt , the supervisor give the word , and the party strike out at a bounce trot on the road to Dr. Livesey 's house .
6 The Captain 's Papers WE ride hard all the way till we draw up before Dr. Livesey 's door .
The house be all dark to the front .
Mr. Dance tell me to jump down and knock , and Dogger give me a stirrup to descend by .
The door be open almost at once by the maid .
`` Is Dr. Livesey in ? ''
I ask .
No , she say , he have come home in the afternoon but have go up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire .
`` So there we go , boy , '' say Mr. Dance .
This time , a the distance be short , I do not mount , but run with Dogger 's stirrup-leather to the lodge gate and up the long , leafless , moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall building look on either hand on great old garden .
Here Mr. Dance dismount , and take me along with him , be admit at a word into the house .
The servant lead u down a matted passage and show u at the end into a great library , all line with bookcase and bust upon the top of them , where the squire and Dr. Livesey sit , pipe in hand , on either side of a bright fire .
I have never see the squire so near at hand .
He be a tall man , over six foot high , and broad in proportion , and he have a bluff , rough-and-ready face , all roughen and redden and line in his long travel .
His eyebrow be very black , and move readily , and this give him a look of some temper , not bad , you would say , but quick and high .
`` Come in , Mr. Dance , '' say he , very stately and condescend .
`` Good evening , Dance , '' say the doctor with a nod .
`` And good evening to you , friend Jim .
What good wind brings you here ? ''
The supervisor stand up straight and stiff and tell his story like a lesson ; and you should have see how the two gentleman lean forward and look at each other , and forget to smoke in their surprise and interest .
When they hear how my mother go back to the inn , Dr. Livesey fairly slap his thigh , and the squire cry `` Bravo ! ''
and break his long pipe against the grate .
Long before it be do , Mr. Trelawney -LRB- that , you will remember , be the squire 's name -RRB- have get up from his seat and be stride about the room , and the doctor , a if to hear the good , have take off his powdered wig and sat there look very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll .
At last Mr. Dance finish the story .
`` Mr. Dance , '' say the squire , `` you be a very noble fellow .
And a for rid down that black , atrocious miscreant , I regard it a an act of virtue , sir , like stamp on a cockroach .
This lad Hawkins be a trump , I perceive .
Hawkins , will you ring that bell ?
Mr. Dance must have some ale . ''
`` And so , Jim , '' say the doctor , `` you have the thing that they be after , have you ? ''
`` Here it be , sir , '' say I , and give him the oilskin packet .
The doctor look it all over , a if his finger be itch to open it ; but instead of do that , he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat .
`` Squire , '' say he , `` when Dance have have his ale he must , of course , be off on his Majesty 's service ; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my house , and with your permission , I propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup . ''
`` As you will , Livesey , '' say the squire ; `` Hawkins have earn good than cold pie . ''
So a big pigeon pie be bring in and put on a sidetable , and I make a hearty supper , for I be as hungry a a hawk , while Mr. Dance be far compliment and at last dismissed .
`` And now , squire , '' say the doctor .
`` And now , Livesey , '' say the squire in the same breath .
`` One at a time , one at a time , '' laugh Dr. Livesey .
`` You have hear of this Flint , I suppose ? ''
`` Heard of him ! ''
cry the squire .
`` Heard of him , you say !
He be the bloodthirsty buccaneer that sail .
Blackbeard be a child to Flint .
The Spaniards be so prodigiously afraid of him that , I tell you , sir , I be sometimes proud he be an Englishman .
I 've see his top-sails with these eye , off Trinidad , and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sail with put back -- put back , sir , into Port of Spain . ''
`` Well , I 've hear of him myself , in England , '' say the doctor .
`` But the point be , have he money ? ''
`` Money ! ''
cry the squire .
`` Have you hear the story ?
What be these villain after but money ?
What do they care for but money ?
For what would they risk their rascal carcass but money ? ''
`` That we shall soon know , '' reply the doctor .
`` But you be so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I can not get a word in .
What I want to know be this : Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint bury his treasure , will that treasure amount to much ? ''
`` Amount , sir ! ''
cry the squire .
`` It will amount to this : If we have the clue you talk about , I fit out a ship in Bristol dock , and take you and Hawkins here along , and I 'll have that treasure if I search a year . ''
`` Very well , '' say the doctor .
`` Now , then , if Jim be agreeable , we 'll open the packet '' ; and he lay it before him on the table .
The bundle be sew together , and the doctor have to get out his instrument case and cut the stitch with his medical scissors .
It contain two thing -- a book and a sealed paper .
`` First of all we 'll try the book , '' observe the doctor .
The squire and I be both peer over his shoulder a he open it , for Dr. Livesey have kindly motion me to come round from the side-table , where I have be eat , to enjoy the sport of the search .
On the first page there be only some scrap of write , such a a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice .
One be the same a the tattoo mark , `` Billy Bones his fancy '' ; then there be `` Mr. W. Bones , mate , '' `` No more rum , '' `` Off Palm Key he get itt , '' and some other snatch , mostly single word and unintelligible .
I could not help wonder who it be that have `` get itt , '' and what `` itt '' be that he get .
A knife in his back as like a not .
`` Not much instruction there , '' say Dr. Livesey a he pass on .
The next ten or twelve page be fill with a curious series of entry .
There be a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money , a in common account-books , but instead of explanatory writing , only a varying number of cross between the two .
On the 12th of June , 1745 , for instance , a sum of seventy pound have plainly become due to someone , and there be nothing but six cross to explain the cause .
In a few case , to be sure , the name of a place would be add , a `` Offe Caraccas , '' or a mere entry of latitude and longitude , a `` 62o 17 ' 20 '' , 19o 2 ' 40 '' . ''
The record last over nearly twenty year , the amount of the separate entry grow large a time go on , and at the end a grand total have be make out after five or six wrong addition , and these word append , `` Bones , his pile . ''
`` I ca n't make head or tail of this , '' say Dr. Livesey .
`` The thing be as clear a noonday , '' cry the squire .
`` This be the black-hearted hound 's account-book .
These cross stand for the name of ship or town that they sink or plunder .
The sum be the scoundrel 's share , and where he fear an ambiguity , you see he add something clearer .
` Offe Caraccas , ' now ; you see , here be some unhappy vessel board off that coast .
God help the poor soul that man her -- coral long ago . ''
`` Right ! ''
say the doctor .
`` See what it be to be a traveller .
Right !
And the amount increase , you see , a he rise in rank . ''
There be little else in the volume but a few bearing of place note in the blank leave towards the end and a table for reduce French , English , and Spanish money to a common value .
`` Thrifty man ! ''
cry the doctor .
`` He be n't the one to be cheat . ''
`` And now , '' say the squire , `` for the other . ''
The paper have be seal in several place with a thimble by way of seal ; the very thimble , perhaps , that I have find in the captain 's pocket .
The doctor open the seal with great care , and there fell out the map of an island , with latitude and longitude , sounding , name of hill and bay and inlet , and every particular that would be need to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon it shore .
It be about nine mile long and five across , shape , you might say , like a fat dragon stand up , and have two fine land-locked harbour , and a hill in the centre part mark `` The Spy-glass . ''
There be several addition of a late date , but above all , three cross of red ink -- two on the north part of the island , one in the southwest -- and beside this last , in the same red ink , and in a small , neat hand , very different from the captain 's tottery character , these word : `` Bulk of treasure here . ''
Over on the back the same hand have write this further information : Tall tree , Spy-glass shoulder , bear a point to the N. of N.N.E . Skeleton Island E.S.E . and by E. Ten foot .
The bar silver be in the north cache ; you can find it by the trend of the east hummock , ten fathom south of the black crag with the face on it .
The arm be easy find , in the sand-hill , N. point of north inlet cape , bear E. and a quarter N. J.F . .
That be all ; but brief a it be , and to me incomprehensible , it fill the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight .
`` Livesey , '' say the squire , `` you will give up this wretched practice at once .
Tomorrow I start for Bristol .
In three week ' time -- three week !
-- two week -- ten day -- we 'll have the best ship , sir , and the choice crew in England .
Hawkins shall come a cabin-boy .
You 'll make a famous cabin-boy , Hawkins .
You , Livesey , be ship 's doctor ; I be admiral .
We 'll take Redruth , Joyce , and Hunter .
We 'll have favourable wind , a quick passage , and not the least difficulty in find the spot , and money to eat , to roll in , to play duck and drake with ever after . ''
`` Trelawney , '' say the doctor , `` I 'll go with you ; and I 'll go bail for it , so will Jim , and be a credit to the undertaking .
There 's only one man I 'm afraid of . ''
`` And who 's that ? ''
cry the squire .
`` Name the dog , sir ! ''
`` You , '' reply the doctor ; `` for you can not hold your tongue .
We be not the only men who know of this paper .
These fellow who attack the inn tonight -- bold , desperate blade , for sure -- and the rest who stay aboard that lugger , and more , I dare say , not far off , be , one and all , through thick and thin , bound that they 'll get that money .
We must none of u go alone till we get to sea .
Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile ; you 'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol , and from first to last , not one of u must breathe a word of what we 've find . ''
`` Livesey , '' return the squire , `` you be always in the right of it .
I 'll be as silent a the grave . ''
PART TWO -- The Sea-cook 7 I Go to Bristol IT be longer than the squire imagine ere we be ready for the sea , and none of our first plan -- not even Dr. Livesey 's , of keep me beside him -- could be carry out a we intend .
The doctor have to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice ; the squire be hard at work at Bristol ; and I live on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth , the gamekeeper , almost a prisoner , but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipation of strange island and adventure .
I brood by the hour together over the map , all the detail of which I well remember .
Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper 's room , I approach that island in my fancy from every possible direction ; I explore every acre of it surface ; I climb a thousand time to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass , and from the top enjoy the most wonderful and change prospect .
Sometimes the isle be thick with savage , with whom we fight , sometimes full of dangerous animal that hunt u , but in all my fancy nothing occur to me so strange and tragic a our actual adventure .
So the week pass on , till one fine day there come a letter address to Dr. Livesey , with this addition , `` To be open , in the case of his absence , by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins . ''
Obeying this order , we find , or rather I find -- for the gamekeeper be a poor hand at read anything but print -- the following important news : Old Anchor Inn , Bristol , March 1 , 17 -- Dear Livesey -- As I do not know whether you be at the hall or still in London , I send this in double to both place .
The ship be buy and fit .
She lie at anchor , ready for sea .
You never imagine a sweeter schooner -- a child might sail her -- two hundred ton ; name , HISPANIOLA .
I get her through my old friend , Blandly , who have prove himself throughout the most surprising trump .
The admirable fellow literally slave in my interest , and so , I may say , do everyone in Bristol , as soon a they get wind of the port we sail for -- treasure , I mean .
`` Redruth , '' say I , interrupt the letter , `` Dr. Livesey will not like that .
The squire have be talk , after all . ''
`` Well , who 's a good right ? ''
growl the gamekeeper .
`` A pretty rum go if squire ai n't to talk for Dr. Livesey , I should think . ''
At that I give up all attempt at commentary and read straight on : Blandly himself find the HISPANIOLA , and by the most admirable management get her for the mere trifle .
There be a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudice against Blandly .
They go the length of declare that this honest creature would do anything for money , that the HISPANIOLA belong to him , and that he sell it me absurdly high -- the most transparent calumny .
None of them dare , however , to deny the merit of the ship .
So far there be not a hitch .
The workpeople , to be sure -- rigger and what not -- be most annoyingly slow ; but time cure that .
It be the crew that trouble me .
I wish a round score of men -- in case of native , buccaneer , or the odious French -- and I have the worry of the deuce itself to find so much a half a dozen , till the most remarkable stroke of fortune bring me the very man that I require .
I be stand on the dock , when , by the mere accident , I fell in talk with him .
I find he be an old sailor , keep a public-house , know all the seafaring men in Bristol , have lose his health ashore , and want a good berth a cook to get to sea again .
He have hobble down there that morning , he say , to get a smell of the salt .
I be monstrously touch -- so would you have be -- and , out of pure pity , I engage him on the spot to be ship 's cook .
Long John Silver , he be call , and have lose a leg ; but that I regard a a recommendation , since he lose it in his country 's service , under the immortal Hawke .
He have no pension , Livesey .
Imagine the abominable age we live in !
Well , sir , I think I have only find a cook , but it be a crew I have discover .
Between Silver and myself we get together in a few day a company of the tough old salt imaginable -- not pretty to look at , but fellow , by their face , of the most indomitable spirit .
I declare we could fight a frigate .
Long John even get rid of two out of the six or seven I have already engage .
He show me in a moment that they be just the sort of fresh-water swab we have to fear in an adventure of importance .
I be in the most magnificent health and spirit , eat like a bull , sleep like a tree , yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old tarpaulin tramp round the capstan .
Seaward , ho !
Hang the treasure !
It 's the glory of the sea that have turn my head .
So now , Livesey , come post ; do not lose an hour , if you respect me .
Let young Hawkins go at once to see his mother , with Redruth for a guard ; and then both come full speed to Bristol .
John Trelawney Postscript -- I do not tell you that Blandly , who , by the way , be to send a consort after u if we do n't turn up by the end of August , have find an admirable fellow for sail master -- a stiff man , which I regret , but in all other respect a treasure .
Long John Silver unearth a very competent man for a mate , a man name Arrow .
I have a boatswain who pip , Livesey ; so thing shall go man-o ' - war fashion on board the good ship HISPANIOLA .
I forget to tell you that Silver be a man of substance ; I know of my own knowledge that he have a banker 's account , which have never be overdraw .
He leave his wife to manage the inn ; and a she be a woman of colour , a pair of old bachelor like you and I may be excuse for guess that it be the wife , quite as much a the health , that send him back to roving .
J. T. P.P.S . -- Hawkins may stay one night with his mother .
J. T .
You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me .
I be half beside myself with glee ; and if ever I despise a man , it be old Tom Redruth , who could do nothing but grumble and lament .
Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have change place with him ; but such be not the squire 's pleasure , and the squire 's pleasure be like law among them all .
Nobody but old Redruth would have dare so much a even to grumble .
The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow , and there I find my mother in good health and spirit .
The captain , who have so long be a cause of so much discomfort , be go where the wicked cease from trouble .
The squire have have everything repair , and the public room and the sign repaint , and have add some furniture -- above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar .
He have find her a boy a an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I be go .
It be on see that boy that I understand , for the first time , my situation .
I have think up to that moment of the adventure before me , not at all of the home that I be leave ; and now , at sight of this clumsy stranger , who be to stay here in my place beside my mother , I have my first attack of tear .
I be afraid I lead that boy a dog 's life , for a he be new to the work , I have a hundred opportunity of set him right and put him down , and I be not slow to profit by them .
The night pass , and the next day , after dinner , Redruth and I be afoot again and on the road .
I say good-bye to Mother and the cove where I have live since I be bear , and the dear old Admiral Benbow -- since he be repaint , no longer quite so dear .
One of my last thought be of the captain , who have so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat , his sabre-cut cheek , and his old brass telescope .
Next moment we have turn the corner and my home be out of sight .
The mail pick u up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath .
I be wedge in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman , and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air , I must have doze a great deal from the very first , and then sleep like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage , for when I be awaken at last it be by a punch in the rib , and I open my eye to find that we be stand still before a large building in a city street and that the day have already break a long time .
`` Where be we ? ''
I ask .
`` Bristol , '' say Tom .
`` Get down . ''
Mr. Trelawney have take up his residence at an inn far down the dock to superintend the work upon the schooner .
Thither we have now to walk , and our way , to my great delight , lay along the quay and beside the great multitude of ship of all size and rig and nation .
In one , sailor be sing at their work , in another there be men aloft , high over my head , hang to thread that seem no thicker than a spider 's .
Though I have live by the shore all my life , I seem never to have be near the sea till then .
The smell of tar and salt be something new .
I saw the most wonderful figurehead , that have all be far over the ocean .
I saw , besides , many old sailor , with ring in their ear , and whisker curl in ringlet , and tarry pigtail , and their swaggering , clumsy sea-walk ; and if I have see a many king or archbishop I could not have be more delighted .
And I be go to sea myself , to sea in a schooner , with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seaman , to sea , bound for an unknown island , and to seek for buried treasure !
While I be still in this delightful dream , we come suddenly in front of a large inn and meet Squire Trelawney , all dress out like a sea-officer , in stout blue cloth , come out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor 's walk .
`` Here you be , '' he cry , `` and the doctor come last night from London .
Bravo !
The ship 's company complete ! ''
`` Oh , sir , '' cry I , `` when do we sail ? ''
`` Sail ! ''
say he .
`` We sail tomorrow ! ''
8 At the Sign of the Spy-glass WHEN I have do breakfast the squire give me a note address to John Silver , at the sign of the Spy-glass , and tell me I should easily find the place by follow the line of the dock and keep a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign .
I set off , overjoy at this opportunity to see some more of the ship and seaman , and pick my way among a great crowd of people and cart and bale , for the dock be now at it busy , until I find the tavern in question .
It be a bright enough little place of entertainment .
The sign be newly paint ; the window have neat red curtain ; the floor be cleanly sand .
There be a street on each side and an open door on both , which make the large , low room pretty clear to see in , in spite of cloud of tobacco smoke .
The customer be mostly seafaring men , and they talk so loudly that I hang at the door , almost afraid to enter .
As I be wait , a man come out of a side room , and at a glance I be sure he must be Long John .
His leave leg be cut off close by the hip , and under the left shoulder he carry a crutch , which he manage with wonderful dexterity , hop about upon it like a bird .
He be very tall and strong , with a face as big a a ham -- plain and pale , but intelligent and smile .
Indeed , he seem in the most cheerful spirit , whistle a he move about among the table , with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guest .
Now , to tell you the truth , from the very first mention of Long John in Squire Trelawney 's letter I have take a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I have watch for so long at the old Benbow .
But one look at the man before me be enough .
I have see the captain , and Black Dog , and the blind man , Pew , and I think I know what a buccaneer be like -- a very different creature , accord to me , from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord .
I pluck up courage at once , cross the threshold , and walk right up to the man where he stand , prop on his crutch , talk to a customer .
`` Mr. Silver , sir ? ''
I ask , hold out the note .
`` Yes , my lad , '' say he ; `` such be my name , to be sure .
And who may you be ? ''
And then a he saw the squire 's letter , he seem to me to give something almost like a start .
`` Oh ! ''
say he , quite loud , and offer his hand .
`` I see .
You be our new cabin-boy ; pleased I be to see you . ''
And he take my hand in his large firm grasp .
Just then one of the customer at the far side rise suddenly and make for the door .
It be close by him , and he be out in the street in a moment .
But his hurry have attract my notice , and I recognize him at glance .
It be the tallow-faced man , want two finger , who have come first to the Admiral Benbow .
`` Oh , '' I cry , `` stop him !
It 's Black Dog ! ''
`` I do n't care two copper who he be , '' cry Silver .
`` But he have n't pay his score .
Harry , run and catch him . ''
One of the others who be nearest the door leap up and start in pursuit .
`` If he be Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score , '' cry Silver ; and then , relinquish my hand , `` Who do you say he be ? ''
he ask .
`` Black what ? ''
`` Dog , sir , '' say I . `` Has Mr. Trelawney not tell you of the buccaneer ?
He be one of them . ''
`` So ? ''
cry Silver .
`` In my house !
Ben , run and help Harry .
One of those swab , be he ?
Was that you drink with him , Morgan ?
Step up here . ''
The man whom he call Morgan -- an old , grey-haired , mahogany-faced sailor -- come forward pretty sheepishly , roll his quid .
`` Now , Morgan , '' say Long John very sternly , `` you never clap your eye on that Black -- Black Dog before , do you , now ? ''
`` Not I , sir , '' say Morgan with a salute .
`` You do n't know his name , do you ? ''
`` No , sir . ''
`` By the power , Tom Morgan , it 's as good for you ! ''
exclaim the landlord .
`` If you have be mix up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that .
And what be he say to you ? ''
`` I do n't rightly know , sir , '' answer Morgan .
`` Do you call that a head on your shoulder , or a bless dead-eye ? ''
cry Long John .
`` Do n't rightly know , do n't you !
Perhaps you do n't happen to rightly know who you be speak to , perhaps ?
Come , now , what be he jaw -- v ` yages , cap'n s , ship ?
Pipe up !
What be it ? ''
`` We be a-talkin ' of keel-hauling , '' answer Morgan .
`` Keel-hauling , be you ?
And a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that .
Get back to your place for a lubber , Tom . ''
And then , a Morgan roll back to his seat , Silver add to me in a confidential whisper that be very flattering , a I think , `` He 's quite an honest man , Tom Morgan , on ' y stupid .
And now , '' he run on again , aloud , `` let 's see -- Black Dog ?
No , I do n't know the name , not I .
Yet I kind of think I 've -- yes , I 've see the swab .
He use to come here with a blind beggar , he use . ''
`` That he do , you may be sure , '' say I . `` I know that blind man too .
His name be Pew . ''
`` It be ! ''
cry Silver , now quite excite .
`` Pew !
That be his name for certain .
Ah , he look a shark , he do !
If we run down this Black Dog , now , there 'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney !
Ben 's a good runner ; few seaman run good than Ben .
He should run him down , hand over hand , by the power !
He talk o ' keel-hauling , do he ?
I 'LL keel-haul him ! ''
All the time he be jerk out these phrase he be stump up and down the tavern on his crutch , slap table with his hand , and give such a show of excitement a would have convince an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner .
My suspicion have be thoroughly reawaken on find Black Dog at the Spy-glass , and I watch the cook narrowly .
But he be too deep , and too ready , and too clever for me , and by the time the two men have come back out of breath and confess that they have lose the track in a crowd , and be scold like thief , I would have go bail for the innocence of Long John Silver .
`` See here , now , Hawkins , '' say he , `` here 's a blessed hard thing on a man like me , now , ai n't it ?
There 's Cap'n Trelawney -- what 's he to think ?
Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sit in my own house drinking of my own rum !
Here you come and tell me of it plain ; and here I let him give u all the slip before my blessed deadlight !
Now , Hawkins , you do me justice with the cap'n .
You 're a lad , you be , but you 're as smart a paint .
I see that when you first come in .
Now , here it be : What could I do , with this old timber I hobble on ?
When I be an A B master mariner I 'd have come up alongside of him , hand over hand , and broach him to in a brace of old shake , I would ; but now -- '' And then , all of a sudden , he stop , and his jaw drop a though he have remember something .
`` The score ! ''
he burst out .
`` Three go o ' rum !
Why , shiver my timber , if I have n't forget my score ! ''
And fall on a bench , he laugh until the tear run down his cheek .
I could not help joining , and we laugh together , peal after peal , until the tavern rang again .
`` Why , what a precious old sea-calf I be ! ''
he say at last , wipe his cheek .
`` You and me should get on well , Hawkins , for I 'll take my davy I should be rat ship 's boy .
But come now , stand by to go about .
This wo n't do .
Dooty be dooty , messmate .
I 'll put on my old cockerel hat , and step along of you to Cap'n Trelawney , and report this here affair .
For mind you , it 's serious , young Hawkins ; and neither you nor me 's come out of it with what I should make so bold a to call credit .
Nor you neither , say you ; not smart -- none of the pair of u smart .
But dash my button !
That be a good un about my score . ''
And he begin to laugh again , and that so heartily , that though I do not see the joke a he do , I be again oblige to join him in his mirth .
On our little walk along the quay , he make himself the most interesting companion , tell me about the different ship that we pass by , their rig , tonnage , and nationality , explain the work that be go forward -- how one be discharge , another take in cargo , and a third make ready for sea -- and every now and then tell me some little anecdote of ship or seaman or repeat a nautical phrase till I have learn it perfectly .
I begin to see that here be one of the best of possible shipmate .
When we get to the inn , the squire and Dr. Livesey be seat together , finish a quart of ale with a toast in it , before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection .
Long John tell the story from first to last , with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth .
`` That be how it be , now , be n't it , Hawkins ? ''
he would say , now and again , and I could always bear him entirely out .
The two gentleman regret that Black Dog have get away , but we all agree there be nothing to be do , and after he have be compliment , Long John take up his crutch and depart .
`` All hand aboard by four this afternoon , '' shout the squire after him .
`` Aye , aye , sir , '' cry the cook , in the passage .
`` Well , squire , '' say Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't put much faith in your discovery , a a general thing ; but I will say this , John Silver suit me . ''
`` The man 's a perfect trump , '' declare the squire .
`` And now , '' add the doctor , `` Jim may come on board with u , may he not ? ''
`` To be sure he may , '' say squire .
`` Take your hat , Hawkins , and we 'll see the ship . ''
9 Powder and Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out , and we go under the figurehead and round the stern of many other ship , and their cable sometimes grate underneath our keel , and sometimes swing above u .
At last , however , we get alongside , and be meet and salute a we step aboard by the mate , Mr. Arrow , a brown old sailor with earring in his ear and a squint .
He and the squire be very thick and friendly , but I soon observe that thing be not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain .
This last be a sharp-looking man who seem angry with everything on board and be soon to tell u why , for we have hardly get down into the cabin when a sailor follow u .
`` Captain Smollett , sir , ax to speak with you , '' say he .
`` I be always at the captain 's order .
Show him in , '' say the squire .
The captain , who be close behind his messenger , enter at once and shut the door behind him .
`` Well , Captain Smollett , what have you to say ?
All well , I hope ; all shipshape and seaworthy ? ''
`` Well , sir , '' say the captain , `` good speak plain , I believe , even at the risk of offence .
I do n't like this cruise ; I do n't like the men ; and I do n't like my officer .
That 's short and sweet . ''
`` Perhaps , sir , you do n't like the ship ? ''
inquire the squire , very angry , a I could see .
`` I ca n't speak a to that , sir , not have see her tried , '' say the captain .
`` She seem a clever craft ; more I ca n't say . ''
`` Possibly , sir , you may not like your employer , either ? ''
say the squire .
But here Dr. Livesey cut in .
`` Stay a bit , '' say he , `` stay a bit .
No use of such question a that but to produce ill feeling .
The captain have say too much or he have say too little , and I 'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his word .
You do n't , you say , like this cruise .
Now , why ? ''
`` I be engage , sir , on what we call sealed order , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , '' say the captain .
`` So far so good .
But now I find that every man before the mast know more than I do .
I do n't call that fair , now , do you ? ''
`` No , '' say Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't . ''
`` Next , '' say the captain , `` I learn we be go after treasure -- hear it from my own hand , mind you .
Now , treasure be ticklish work ; I do n't like treasure voyage on any account , and I do n't like them , above all , when they be secret and when -LRB- beg your pardon , Mr. Trelawney -RRB- the secret have be tell to the parrot . ''
`` Silver 's parrot ? ''
ask the squire .
`` It 's a way of speaking , '' say the captain .
`` Blabbed , I mean .
It 's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you be about , but I 'll tell you my way of it -- life or death , and a close run . ''
`` That be all clear , and , I dare say , true enough , '' reply Dr. Livesey .
`` We take the risk , but we be not so ignorant a you believe u .
Next , you say you do n't like the crew .
Are they not good seaman ? ''
`` I do n't like them , sir , '' return Captain Smollett .
`` And I think I should have have the choosing of my own hand , if you go to that . ''
`` Perhaps you should , '' reply the doctor .
`` My friend should , perhaps , have take you along with him ; but the slight , if there be one , be unintentional .
And you do n't like Mr. Arrow ? ''
`` I do n't , sir .
I believe he 's a good seaman , but he 's too free with the crew to be a good officer .
A mate should keep himself to himself -- should n't drink with the men before the mast ! ''
`` Do you mean he drink ? ''
cry the squire .
`` No , sir , '' reply the captain , `` only that he 's too familiar . ''
`` Well , now , and the short and long of it , captain ? ''
ask the doctor .
`` Tell u what you want . ''
`` Well , gentleman , be you determine to go on this cruise ? ''
`` Like iron , '' answer the squire .
`` Very good , '' say the captain .
`` Then , a you 've hear me very patiently , say thing that I could not prove , hear me a few word more .
They be put the powder and the arm in the fore hold .
Now , you have a good place under the cabin ; why not put them there ?
-- first point .
Then , you be bring four of your own people with you , and they tell me some of them be to be berth forward .
Why not give them the berth here beside the cabin ?
-- second point . ''
`` Any more ? ''
ask Mr. Trelawney .
`` One more , '' say the captain .
`` There 's be too much blabbing already . ''
`` Far too much , '' agree the doctor .
`` I 'll tell you what I 've hear myself , '' continue Captain Smollett : `` that you have a map of an island , that there 's cross on the map to show where treasure be , and that the island lie -- '' And then he name the latitude and longitude exactly .
`` I never tell that , '' cry the squire , `` to a soul ! ''
`` The hand know it , sir , '' return the captain .
`` Livesey , that must have be you or Hawkins , '' cry the squire .
`` It do n't much matter who it be , '' reply the doctor .
And I could see that neither he nor the captain pay much regard to Mr. Trelawney 's protestation .
Neither do I , to be sure , he be so loose a talker ; yet in this case I believe he be really right and that nobody have tell the situation of the island .
`` Well , gentleman , '' continue the captain , `` I do n't know who have this map ; but I make it a point , it shall be keep secret even from me and Mr. Arrow .
Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign . ''
`` I see , '' say the doctor .
`` You wish u to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship , man with my friend 's own people , and provide with all the arm and powder on board .
In other word , you fear a mutiny . ''
`` Sir , '' say Captain Smollett , `` with no intention to take offence , I deny your right to put word into my mouth .
No captain , sir , would be justify in go to sea at all if he have ground enough to say that .
As for Mr. Arrow , I believe him thoroughly honest ; some of the men be the same ; all may be for what I know .
But I be responsible for the ship 's safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her .
I see thing go , a I think , not quite right .
And I ask you to take certain precaution or let me resign my berth .
And that 's all . ''
`` Captain Smollett , '' begin the doctor with a smile , `` do ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse ?
You 'll excuse me , I dare say , but you remind me of that fable .
When you come in here , I 'll stake my wig , you mean more than this . ''
`` Doctor , '' say the captain , `` you be smart .
When I come in here I mean to get discharge .
I have no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word . ''
`` No more I would , '' cry the squire .
`` Had Livesey not be here I should have see you to the deuce .
As it be , I have hear you .
I will do a you desire , but I think the bad of you . ''
`` That 's a you please , sir , '' say the captain .
`` You 'll find I do my duty . ''
And with that he take his leave .
`` Trelawney , '' say the doctor , `` contrary to all my notion , I believe you have manage to get two honest men on board with you -- that man and John Silver . ''
`` Silver , if you like , '' cry the squire ; `` but a for that intolerable humbug , I declare I think his conduct unmanly , unsailorly , and downright un-English . ''
`` Well , '' say the doctor , `` we shall see . ''
When we come on deck , the men have begin already to take out the arm and powder , yo-ho-ing at their work , while the captain and Mr. Arrow stand by superintend .
The new arrangement be quite to my liking .
The whole schooner have be overhaul ; six berth have be make astern out of what have be the after-part of the main hold ; and this set of cabin be only join to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side .
It have be originally mean that the captain , Mr. Arrow , Hunter , Joyce , the doctor , and the squire be to occupy these six berth .
Now Redruth and I be to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain be to sleep on deck in the companion , which have be enlarge on each side till you might almost have call it a round-house .
Very low it be still , of course ; but there be room to swing two hammock , and even the mate seem pleased with the arrangement .
Even he , perhaps , have be doubtful a to the crew , but that be only guess , for a you shall hear , we have not long the benefit of his opinion .
We be all hard at work , change the powder and the berth , when the last man or two , and Long John along with them , come off in a shore-boat .
The cook come up the side like a monkey for cleverness , and as soon a he saw what be do , `` So ho , mat ! ''
say he .
`` What 's this ? ''
`` We 're a-changing of the powder , Jack , '' answer one .
`` Why , by the power , '' cry Long John , `` if we do , we 'll miss the morning tide ! ''
`` My order ! ''
say the captain shortly .
`` You may go below , my man .
Hands will want supper . ''
`` Aye , aye , sir , '' answer the cook , and touch his forelock , he disappear at once in the direction of his galley .
`` That 's a good man , captain , '' say the doctor .
`` Very likely , sir , '' reply Captain Smollett .
`` Easy with that , men -- easy , '' he run on , to the fellow who be shift the powder ; and then suddenly observe me examine the swivel we carry amidships , a long brass nine , `` Here you , ship 's boy , '' he cry , `` out o ' that !
Off with you to the cook and get some work . ''
And then a I be hurry off I hear him say , quite loudly , to the doctor , `` I 'll have no favourite on my ship . ''
I assure you I be quite of the squire 's way of thinking , and hat the captain deeply .
10 The Voyage ALL that night we be in a great bustle get thing stow in their place , and boatfuls of the squire 's friend , Mr. Blandly and the like , come off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return .
We never have a night at the Admiral Benbow when I have half the work ; and I be dog-tired when , a little before dawn , the boatswain sound his pipe and the crew begin to man the capstan-bars .
I might have be twice a weary , yet I would not have leave the deck , all be so new and interesting to me -- the brief command , the shrill note of the whistle , the men bustle to their place in the glimmer of the ship 's lantern .
`` Now , Barbecue , tip u a stave , '' cry one voice .
`` The old one , '' cry another .
`` Aye , aye , mate , '' say Long John , who be stand by , with his crutch under his arm , and at once break out in the air and word I know so well : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- '' And then the whole crew bore chorus : -- `` Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''
And at the third `` Ho ! ''
drive the bar before them with a will .
Even at that excite moment it carry me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second , and I seem to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus .
But soon the anchor be short up ; soon it be hang drip at the bow ; soon the sail begin to draw , and the land and shipping to flit by on either side ; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA have begin her voyage to the Isle of Treasure .
I be not go to relate that voyage in detail .
It be fairly prosperous .
The ship prove to be a good ship , the crew be capable seaman , and the captain thoroughly understand his business .
But before we come the length of Treasure Island , two or three thing have happen which require to be know .
Mr. Arrow , first of all , turn out even bad than the captain have fear .
He have no command among the men , and people do what they please with him .
But that be by no mean the bad of it , for after a day or two at sea he begin to appear on deck with hazy eye , red cheek , stutter tongue , and other mark of drunkenness .
Time after time he be order below in disgrace .
Sometimes he fell and cut himself ; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion ; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably .
In the meantime , we could never make out where he get the drink .
That be the ship 's mystery .
Watch him a we please , we could do nothing to solve it ; and when we ask him to his face , he would only laugh if he be drunk , and if he be sober deny solemnly that he ever taste anything but water .
He be not only useless a an officer and a bad influence amongst the men , but it be plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright , so nobody be much surprised , nor very sorry , when one dark night , with a head sea , he disappear entirely and be see no more .
`` Overboard ! ''
say the captain .
`` Well , gentleman , that save the trouble of put him in iron . ''
But there we be , without a mate ; and it be necessary , of course , to advance one of the men .
The boatswain , Job Anderson , be the likeliest man aboard , and though he keep his old title , he serve in a way a mate .
Mr. Trelawney have follow the sea , and his knowledge make him very useful , for he often take a watch himself in easy weather .
And the coxswain , Israel Hands , be a careful , wily , old , experienced seaman who could be trust at a pinch with almost anything .
He be a great confidant of Long John Silver , and so the mention of his name lead me on to speak of our ship 's cook , Barbecue , a the men call him .
Aboard ship he carry his crutch by a lanyard round his neck , to have both hand as free a possible .
It be something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead , and prop against it , yield to every movement of the ship , get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore .
Still more strange be it to see him in the heavy of weather cross the deck .
He have a line or two rig up to help him across the wide space -- Long John 's earring , they be call ; and he would hand himself from one place to another , now use the crutch , now trail it alongside by the lanyard , as quickly a another man could walk .
Yet some of the men who have sail with him before express their pity to see him so reduce .
`` He 's no common man , Barbecue , '' say the coxswain to me .
`` He have good schooling in his young day and can speak like a book when so mind ; and brave -- a lion 's nothing alongside of Long John !
I see him grapple four and knock their head together -- him unarmed . ''
All the crew respect and even obey him .
He have a way of talk to each and do everybody some particular service .
To me he be unweariedly kind , and always glad to see me in the galley , which he keep as clean a a new pin , the dish hang up burnish and his parrot in a cage in one corner .
`` Come away , Hawkins , '' he would say ; `` come and have a yarn with John .
Nobody more welcome than yourself , my son .
Sit you down and hear the news .
Here 's Cap'n Flint -- I call my parrot Cap'n Flint , after the famous buccaneer -- here 's Cap'n Flint predict success to our v ` yage .
Was n't you , cap'n ? ''
And the parrot would say , with great rapidity , `` Pieces of eight !
Pieces of eight !
Pieces of eight ! ''
till you wonder that it be not out of breath , or till John throw his handkerchief over the cage .
`` Now , that bird , '' he would say , `` be , maybe , two hundred year old , Hawkins -- they live forever mostly ; and if anybody 's see more wickedness , it must be the devil himself .
She 's sail with England , the great Cap'n England , the pirate .
She 's be at Madagascar , and at Malabar , and Surinam , and Providence , and Portobello .
She be at the fish up of the wrecked plate ship .
It 's there she learn ` Pieces of eight , ' and little wonder ; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em , Hawkins !
She be at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa , she be ; and to look at her you would think she be a babby .
But you smelt powder -- do n't you , cap'n ? ''
`` Stand by to go about , '' the parrot would scream .
`` Ah , she 's a handsome craft , she be , '' the cook would say , and give her sugar from his pocket , and then the bird would peck at the bar and swear straight on , pass belief for wickedness .
`` There , '' John would add , `` you ca n't touch pitch and not be muck , lad .
Here 's this poor old innocent bird o ' mine swear blue fire , and none the wiser , you may lay to that .
She would swear the same , in a manner of speaking , before chaplain . ''
And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he have that make me think he be the best of men .
In the meantime , the squire and Captain Smollett be still on pretty distant term with one another .
The squire make no bone about the matter ; he despise the captain .
The captain , on his part , never speak but when he be speak to , and then sharp and short and dry , and not a word waste .
He own , when drive into a corner , that he seem to have be wrong about the crew , that some of them be as brisk a he want to see and all have behave fairly well .
As for the ship , he have take a downright fancy to her .
`` She 'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man have a right to expect of his own married wife , sir .
But , '' he would add , `` all I say be , we 're not home again , and I do n't like the cruise . ''
The squire , at this , would turn away and march up and down the deck , chin in air .
`` A trifle more of that man , '' he would say , `` and I shall explode . ''
We have some heavy weather , which only prove the quality of the HISPANIOLA .
Every man on board seem well content , and they must have be hard to please if they have be otherwise , for it be my belief there be never a ship 's company so spoil since Noah put to sea .
Double grog be go on the least excuse ; there be duff on odd day , a , for instance , if the squire hear it be any man 's birthday , and always a barrel of apple stand broach in the waist for anyone to help himself that have a fancy .
`` Never know good come of it yet , '' the captain say to Dr. Livesey .
`` Spoil forecastle hand , make devil .
That 's my belief . ''
But good do come of the apple barrel , a you shall hear , for if it have not be for that , we should have have no note of warning and might all have perish by the hand of treachery .
This be how it come about .
We have run up the trade to get the wind of the island we be after -- I be not allow to be more plain -- and now we be run down for it with a bright lookout day and night .
It be about the last day of our outward voyage by the large computation ; some time that night , or at late before noon of the morrow , we should sight the Treasure Island .
We be head S.S.W . and have a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea .
The HISPANIOLA roll steadily , dip her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray .
All be draw alow and aloft ; everyone be in the brave spirit because we be now so near an end of the first part of our adventure .
Now , just after sundown , when all my work be over and I be on my way to my berth , it occur to me that I should like an apple .
I run on deck .
The watch be all forward look out for the island .
The man at the helm be watch the luff of the sail and whistle away gently to himself , and that be the only sound except the swish of the sea against the bow and around the side of the ship .
In I get bodily into the apple barrel , and find there be scarce an apple leave ; but sit down there in the dark , what with the sound of the water and the rock movement of the ship , I have either fall asleep or be on the point of do so when a heavy man sit down with rather a clash close by .
The barrel shook a he lean his shoulder against it , and I be just about to jump up when the man begin to speak .
It be Silver 's voice , and before I have hear a dozen word , I would not have show myself for all the world , but lay there , tremble and listen , in the extreme of fear and curiosity , for from these dozen word I understand that the life of all the honest men aboard depend upon me alone .
11 What I Heard in the Apple Barrel `` NO , not I , '' say Silver .
`` Flint be cap'n ; I be quartermaster , along of my timber leg .
The same broadside I lose my leg , old Pew lose his deadlight .
It be a master surgeon , him that ampytated me -- out of college and all -- Latin by the bucket , and what not ; but he be hang like a dog , and sun-dried like the rest , at Corso Castle .
That be Roberts ' men , that be , and come of change name to their ship -- ROYAL FORTUNE and so on .
Now , what a ship be christen , so let her stay , I say .
So it be with the CASSANDRA , a bring u all safe home from Malabar , after England take the viceroy of the Indies ; so it be with the old WALRUS , Flint 's old ship , a I 've see amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold . ''
`` Ah ! ''
cry another voice , that of the young hand on board , and evidently full of admiration .
`` He be the flower of the flock , be Flint ! ''
`` Davis be a man too , by all account , '' say Silver .
`` I never sail along of him ; first with England , then with Flint , that 's my story ; and now here on my own account , in a manner of speaking .
I lay by nine hundred safe , from England , and two thousand after Flint .
That ai n't bad for a man before the mast -- all safe in bank .
` Tai n't earn now , it 's save do it , you may lay to that .
Where 's all England 's men now ?
I dunno .
Where 's Flint 's ?
Why , most on 'em aboard here , and glad to get the duff -- be beg before that , some on 'em .
Old Pew , a have lose his sight , and might have think shame , spend twelve hundred pound in a year , like a lord in Parliament .
Where be he now ?
Well , he 's dead now and under hatch ; but for two year before that , shiver my timber , the man be starve !
He beg , and he steal , and he cut throat , and starve at that , by the power ! ''
`` Well , it ai n't much use , after all , '' say the young seaman . ''
` Tai n't much use for fool , you may lay to it -- that , nor nothing , '' cry Silver .
`` But now , you look here : you 're young , you be , but you 're as smart a paint .
I see that when I set my eye on you , and I 'll talk to you like a man . ''
You may imagine how I felt when I hear this abominable old rogue address another in the very same word of flattery a he have use to myself .
I think , if I have be able , that I would have kill him through the barrel .
Meantime , he run on , little suppose he be overheard .
`` Here it be about gentleman of fortune .
They live rough , and they risk swing , but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks , and when a cruise be do , why , it 's hundred of pound instead of hundred of farthing in their pocket .
Now , the most go for rum and a good fling , and to sea again in their shirt .
But that 's not the course I lay .
I put it all away , some here , some there , and none too much anywheres , by reason of suspicion .
I 'm fifty , mark you ; once back from this cruise , I set up gentleman in earnest .
Time enough too , say you .
Ah , but I 've live easy in the meantime , never deny myself o ' nothing heart desire , and slep ' soft and ate dainty all my day but when at sea .
And how do I begin ?
Before the mast , like you ! ''
`` Well , '' say the other , `` but all the other money 's go now , ai n't it ?
You dare n't show face in Bristol after this . ''
`` Why , where might you suppose it be ? ''
ask Silver derisively .
`` At Bristol , in bank and place , '' answer his companion .
`` It be , '' say the cook ; `` it be when we weigh anchor .
But my old missis have it all by now .
And the Spy-glass be sell , lease and goodwill and rigging ; and the old girl 's off to meet me .
I would tell you where , for I trust you , but it 'd make jealousy among the mate . ''
`` And can you trust your missis ? ''
ask the other .
`` Gentlemen of fortune , '' return the cook , `` usually trust little among themselves , and right they be , you may lay to it .
But I have a way with me , I have .
When a mate bring a slip on his cable -- one a know me , I mean -- it wo n't be in the same world with old John .
There be some that be fear of Pew , and some that be fear of Flint ; but Flint his own self be fear of me .
Feared he be , and proud .
They be the rough crew afloat , be Flint 's ; the devil himself would have be fear to go to sea with them .
Well now , I tell you , I 'm not a boasting man , and you see yourself how easy I keep company , but when I be quartermaster , LAMBS be n't the word for Flint 's old buccaneer .
Ah , you may be sure of yourself in old John 's ship . ''
`` Well , I tell you now , '' reply the lad , `` I do n't half a quarter like the job till I have this talk with you , John ; but there 's my hand on it now . ''
`` And a brave lad you be , and smart too , '' answer Silver , shake hand so heartily that all the barrel shook , `` and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clap my eye on . ''
By this time I have begin to understand the meaning of their term .
By a `` gentleman of fortune '' they plainly mean neither more nor less than a common pirate , and the little scene that I have overheard be the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hand -- perhaps of the last one leave aboard .
But on this point I be soon to be relieve , for Silver give a little whistle , a third man stroll up and sit down by the party .
`` Dick 's square , '' say Silver .
`` Oh , I know 'd Dick be square , '' return the voice of the coxswain , Israel Hands .
`` He 's no fool , be Dick . ''
And he turn his quid and spat .
`` But look here , '' he go on , `` here 's what I want to know , Barbecue : how long be we a-going to stand off and on like a bless bumboat ?
I 've have a ` most enough o ' Cap'n Smollett ; he 's haze me long enough , by thunder !
I want to go into that cabin , I do .
I want their pickle and wine , and that . ''
`` Israel , '' say Silver , `` your head ai n't much account , nor ever be .
But you 're able to hear , I reckon ; leastways , your ear be big enough .
Now , here 's what I say : you 'll berth forward , and you 'll live hard , and you 'll speak soft , and you 'll keep sober till I give the word ; and you may lay to that , my son . ''
`` Well , I do n't say no , do I ? ''
growl the coxswain .
`` What I say be , when ?
That 's what I say . ''
`` When !
By the power ! ''
cry Silver .
`` Well now , if you want to know , I 'll tell you when .
The last moment I can manage , and that 's when .
Here 's a first-rate seaman , Cap'n Smollett , sail the blessed ship for u .
Here 's this squire and doctor with a map and such -- I do n't know where it be , do I ?
No more do you , say you .
Well then , I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff , and help u to get it aboard , by the power .
Then we 'll see .
If I be sure of you all , son of double Dutchmen , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate u half-way back again before I strike . ''
`` Why , we 're all seaman aboard here , I should think , '' say the lad Dick .
`` We 're all forecastle hand , you mean , '' snap Silver .
`` We can steer a course , but who 's to set one ?
That 's what all you gentlemen split on , first and last .
If I have my way , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett work u back into the trade at least ; then we 'd have no bless miscalculation and a spoonful of water a day .
But I know the sort you be .
I 'll finish with 'em at the island , a soon 's the blunt 's on board , and a pity it be .
But you 're never happy till you 're drunk .
Split my side , I 've a sick heart to sail with the like of you ! ''
`` Easy all , Long John , '' cry Israel .
`` Who 's a-crossin ' of you ? ''
`` Why , how many tall ship , think ye , now , have I see lay aboard ?
And how many brisk lad dry in the sun at Execution Dock ? ''
cry Silver .
`` And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry .
You hear me ?
I see a thing or two at sea , I have .
If you would on ' y lay your course , and a p ` int to windward , you would ride in carriage , you would .
But not you !
I know you .
You 'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow , and go hang . ''
`` Everybody know you be a kind of a chapling , John ; but there 's others a could hand and steer as well a you , '' say Israel .
`` They like a bit o ' fun , they do .
They be n't so high and dry , nohow , but take their fling , like jolly companion every one . ''
`` So ? ''
say Silver .
`` Well , and where be they now ?
Pew be that sort , and he die a beggar-man .
Flint be , and he die of rum at Savannah .
Ah , they be a sweet crew , they be !
On ` y , where be they ? ''
`` But , '' ask Dick , `` when we do lay 'em athwart , what be we to do with 'em , anyhow ? ''
`` There 's the man for me ! ''
cry the cook admiringly .
`` That 's what I call business .
Well , what would you think ?
Put 'em ashore like maroon ?
That would have be England 's way .
Or cut 'em down like that much pork ?
That would have be Flint 's , or Billy Bones 's . ''
`` Billy be the man for that , '' say Israel . ''
` Dead men do n't bite , ' say he .
Well , he 's dead now hisself ; he know the long and short on it now ; and if ever a rough hand come to port , it be Billy . ''
`` Right you be , '' say Silver ; `` rough and ready .
But mark you here , I 'm an easy man -- I 'm quite the gentleman , say you ; but this time it 's serious .
Dooty be dooty , mate .
I give my vote -- death .
When I 'm in Parlyment and rid in my coach , I do n't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home , unlooked for , like the devil at prayer .
Wait be what I say ; but when the time come , why , let her rip ! ''
`` John , '' cry the coxswain , `` you 're a man ! ''
`` You 'll say so , Israel when you see , '' say Silver .
`` Only one thing I claim -- I claim Trelawney .
I 'll wring his calf 's head off his body with these hand , Dick ! ''
he add , break off .
`` You just jump up , like a sweet lad , and get me an apple , to wet my pipe like . ''
You may fancy the terror I be in !
I should have leap out and run for it if I have find the strength , but my limb and heart alike misgive me .
I hear Dick begin to rise , and then someone seemingly stop him , and the voice of Hands exclaim , `` Oh , stow that !
Do n't you get suck of that bilge , John .
Let 's have a go of the rum . ''
`` Dick , '' say Silver , `` I trust you .
I 've a gauge on the keg , mind .
There 's the key ; you fill a pannikin and bring it up . ''
Terrified a I be , I could not help think to myself that this must have be how Mr. Arrow get the strong water that destroy him .
Dick be go but a little while , and during his absence Israel speak straight on in the cook 's ear .
It be but a word or two that I could catch , and yet I gather some important news , for besides other scrap that tend to the same purpose , this whole clause be audible : `` Not another man of them 'll jine . ''
Hence there be still faithful men on board .
When Dick return , one after another of the trio take the pannikin and drank -- one `` To luck , '' another with a `` Here 's to old Flint , '' and Silver himself say , in a kind of song , `` Here 's to ourselves , and hold your luff , plenty of prize and plenty of duff . ''
Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel , and look up , I find the moon have rise and be silver the mizzen-top and shin white on the luff of the fore-sail ; and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shout , `` Land ho ! ''
12 Council of War THERE be a great rush of foot across the deck .
I could hear people tumble up from the cabin and the forecastle , and slip in an instant outside my barrel , I dive behind the fore-sail , make a double towards the stern , and come out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow .
There all hand be already congregate .
A belt of fog have lift almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon .
Away to the south-west of u we saw two low hill , about a couple of mile apart , and rise behind one of them a third and high hill , whose peak be still bury in the fog .
All three seem sharp and conical in figure .
So much I saw , almost in a dream , for I have not yet recover from my horrid fear of a minute or two before .
And then I hear the voice of Captain Smollett issue order .
The HISPANIOLA be lay a couple of point nearer the wind and now sail a course that would just clear the island on the east .
`` And now , men , '' say the captain , when all be sheet home , `` have any one of you ever see that land ahead ? ''
`` I have , sir , '' say Silver .
`` I 've water there with a trader I be cook in . ''
`` The anchorage be on the south , behind an islet , I fancy ? ''
ask the captain .
`` Yes , sir ; Skeleton Island they call it .
It be a main place for pirate once , and a hand we have on board know all their name for it .
That hill to the nor ` ard they call the Fore-mast Hill ; there be three hill in a row run south ` ard -- fore , main , and mizzen , sir .
But the main -- that 's the big un , with the cloud on it -- they usually call the Spy-glass , by reason of a lookout they keep when they be in the anchorage cleaning , for it 's there they clean their ship , sir , ask your pardon . ''
`` I have a chart here , '' say Captain Smollett .
`` See if that 's the place . ''
Long John 's eye burn in his head a he take the chart , but by the fresh look of the paper I know he be doom to disappointment .
This be not the map we find in Billy Bones 's chest , but an accurate copy , complete in all thing -- name and height and sounding -- with the single exception of the red cross and the write note .
Sharp a must have be his annoyance , Silver have the strength of mind to hide it .
`` Yes , sir , '' say he , `` this be the spot , to be sure , and very prettily draw out .
Who might have do that , I wonder ?
The pirate be too ignorant , I reckon .
Aye , here it be : ` Capt . Kidd 's Anchorage ' -- just the name my shipmate call it .
There 's a strong current run along the south , and then away nor ` ard up the west coast .
Right you be , sir , '' say he , `` to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island .
Leastways , if such be your intention a to enter and careen , and there ai n't no good place for that in these water . ''
`` Thank you , my man , '' say Captain Smollett .
`` I 'll ask you later on to give u a help .
You may go . ''
I be surprise at the coolness with which John avow his knowledge of the island , and I own I be half-frightened when I saw him draw nearer to myself .
He do not know , to be sure , that I have overhear his council from the apple barrel , and yet I have by this time take such a horror of his cruelty , duplicity , and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he lay his hand upon my arm .
`` Ah , '' say he , `` this here be a sweet spot , this island -- a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on .
You 'll bathe , and you 'll climb tree , and you 'll hunt goat , you will ; and you 'll get aloft on them hill like a goat yourself .
Why , it make me young again .
I be go to forget my timber leg , I be .
It 's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toe , and you may lay to that .
When you want to go a bit of explore , you just ask old John , and he 'll put up a snack for you to take along . ''
And clap me in the friendly way upon the shoulder , he hobble off forward and go below .
Captain Smollett , the squire , and Dr. Livesey be talk together on the quarter-deck , and anxious a I be to tell them my story , I durst not interrupt them openly .
While I be still cast about in my thought to find some probable excuse , Dr. Livesey call me to his side .
He have leave his pipe below , and be a slave to tobacco , have mean that I should fetch it ; but as soon a I be near enough to speak and not to be overheard , I break immediately , `` Doctor , let me speak .
Get the captain and squire down to the cabin , and then make some pretence to send for me .
I have terrible news . ''
The doctor change countenance a little , but next moment he be master of himself .
`` Thank you , Jim , '' say he quite loudly , `` that be all I want to know , '' a if he have ask me a question .
And with that he turn on his heel and rejoin the other two .
They speak together for a little , and though none of them start , or raise his voice , or so much a whistled , it be plain enough that Dr. Livesey have communicate my request , for the next thing that I hear be the captain give an order to Job Anderson , and all hand be pip on deck .
`` My lad , '' say Captain Smollett , `` I 've a word to say to you .
This land that we have sight be the place we have be sail for .
Mr. Trelawney , be a very open-handed gentleman , a we all know , have just ask me a word or two , and a I be able to tell him that every man on board have do his duty , alow and aloft , a I never ask to see it do well , why , he and I and the doctor be go below to the cabin to drink YOUR health and luck , and you 'll have grog serve out for you to drink OUR health and luck .
I 'll tell you what I think of this : I think it handsome .
And if you think a I do , you 'll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that do it . ''
The cheer follow -- that be a matter of course ; but it ring out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men be plot for our blood .
`` One more cheer for Cap'n Smollett , '' cry Long John when the first have subside .
And this also be give with a will .
On the top of that the three gentleman go below , and not long after , word be send forward that Jim Hawkins be want in the cabin .
I find them all three seat round the table , a bottle of Spanish wine and some raisin before them , and the doctor smoke away , with his wig on his lap , and that , I know , be a sign that he be agitate .
The stern window be open , for it be a warm night , and you could see the moon shin behind on the ship 's wake .
`` Now , Hawkins , '' say the squire , `` you have something to say .
Speak up . ''
I do a I be bid , and as short a I could make it , tell the whole detail of Silver 's conversation .
Nobody interrupt me till I be do , nor do any one of the three of them make so much a a movement , but they keep their eye upon my face from first to last .
`` Jim , '' say Dr. Livesey , `` take a seat . ''
And they make me sit down at table beside them , pour me out a glass of wine , fill my hand with raisin , and all three , one after the other , and each with a bow , drink my good health , and their service to me , for my luck and courage .
`` Now , captain , '' say the squire , `` you be right , and I be wrong .
I own myself an as , and I await your order . ''
`` No more an as than I , sir , '' return the captain .
`` I never heard of a crew that mean to mutiny but what show sign before , for any man that have an eye in his head to see the mischief and take step accord .
But this crew , '' he add , `` beat me . ''
`` Captain , '' say the doctor , `` with your permission , that 's Silver .
A very remarkable man . ''
`` He 'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm , sir , '' return the captain .
`` But this be talk ; this do n't lead to anything .
I see three or four point , and with Mr. Trelawney 's permission , I 'll name them . ''
`` You , sir , be the captain .
It be for you to speak , '' say Mr. Trelawney grandly .
`` First point , '' begin Mr. Smollett .
`` We must go on , because we ca n't turn back .
If I give the word to go about , they would rise at once .
Second point , we have time before u -- at least until this treasure 's found .
Third point , there be faithful hand .
Now , sir , it 's get to come to blow sooner or later , and what I propose be to take time by the forelock , a the saying be , and come to blow some fine day when they least expect it .
We can count , I take it , on your own home servant , Mr. Trelawney ? ''
`` As upon myself , '' declare the squire .
`` Three , '' reckon the captain ; `` ourselves make seven , count Hawkins here .
Now , about the honest hand ? ''
`` Most likely Trelawney 's own men , '' say the doctor ; `` those he have pick up for himself before he light on Silver . ''
`` Nay , '' reply the squire .
`` Hands be one of mine . ''
`` I do think I could have trust Hands , '' add the captain .
`` And to think that they 're all Englishmen ! ''
break out the squire .
`` Sir , I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up . ''
`` Well , gentleman , '' say the captain , `` the best that I can say be not much .
We must lay to , if you please , and keep a bright lookout .
It 's try on a man , I know .
It would be pleasanter to come to blow .
But there 's no help for it till we know our men .
Lay to , and whistle for a wind , that 's my view . ''
`` Jim here , '' say the doctor , `` can help u more than anyone .
The men be not shy with him , and Jim be a noticing lad . ''
`` Hawkins , I put prodigious faith in you , '' add the squire .
I begin to feel pretty desperate at this , for I felt altogether helpless ; and yet , by an odd train of circumstance , it be indeed through me that safety come .
In the meantime , talk a we please , there be only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we know we could rely ; and out of these seven one be a boy , so that the grown men on our side be six to their nineteen .
PART THREE -- My Shore Adventure 13 How My Shore Adventure Began THE appearance of the island when I come on deck next morning be altogether change .
Although the breeze have now utterly cease , we have make a great deal of way during the night and be now lie becalm about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast .
Grey-coloured wood cover a large part of the surface .
This even tint be indeed break up by streak of yellow sand-break in the low land , and by many tall tree of the pine family , out-topping the others -- some singly , some in clump ; but the general colouring be uniform and sad .
The hill run up clear above the vegetation in spire of naked rock .
All be strangely shape , and the Spy-glass , which be by three or four hundred foot the tallest on the island , be likewise the strange in configuration , run up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on .
The HISPANIOLA be roll scupper under in the ocean swell .
The boom be tear at the block , the rudder be bang to and fro , and the whole ship creaking , groaning , and jump like a manufactory .
I have to cling tight to the backstay , and the world turn giddily before my eye , for though I be a good enough sailor when there be way on , this standing still and be roll about like a bottle be a thing I never learn to stand without a qualm or so , above all in the morning , on an empty stomach .
Perhaps it be this -- perhaps it be the look of the island , with it grey , melancholy wood , and wild stone spire , and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thunder on the steep beach -- at least , although the sun shone bright and hot , and the shore bird be fish and cry all around u , and you would have think anyone would have be glad to get to land after be so long at sea , my heart sank , a the saying be , into my boot ; and from the first look onward , I hat the very thought of Treasure Island .
We have a dreary morning 's work before u , for there be no sign of any wind , and the boat have to be get out and man , and the ship warp three or four mile round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island .
I volunteer for one of the boat , where I have , of course , no business .
The heat be swelter , and the men grumble fiercely over their work .
Anderson be in command of my boat , and instead of keep the crew in order , he grumble as loud a the bad .
`` Well , '' he say with an oath , `` it 's not forever . ''
I think this be a very bad sign , for up to that day the men have go briskly and willingly about their business ; but the very sight of the island have relax the cord of discipline .
All the way in , Long John stood by the steersman and con the ship .
He know the passage like the palm of his hand , and though the man in the chain get everywhere more water than be down in the chart , John never hesitate once .
`` There 's a strong scour with the ebb , '' he say , `` and this here passage have be dig out , in a manner of speaking , with a spade . ''
We bring up just where the anchor be in the chart , about a third of a mile from each shore , the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on the other .
The bottom be clean sand .
The plunge of our anchor send up cloud of bird wheel and cry over the wood , but in less than a minute they be down again and all be once more silent .
The place be entirely land-locked , bury in wood , the tree come right down to high-water mark , the shore mostly flat , and the hilltop stand round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre , one here , one there .
Two little river , or rather two swamp , empty out into this pond , a you might call it ; and the foliage round that part of the shore have a kind of poisonous brightness .
From the ship we could see nothing of the house or stockade , for they be quite bury among tree ; and if it have not be for the chart on the companion , we might have be the first that have ever anchor there since the island arise out of the sea .
There be not a breath of air move , nor a sound but that of the surf boom half a mile away along the beach and against the rock outside .
A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage -- a smell of sodden leaf and rot tree trunk .
I observe the doctor sniffing and sniffing , like someone taste a bad egg .
`` I do n't know about treasure , '' he say , `` but I 'll stake my wig there 's fever here . ''
If the conduct of the men have be alarm in the boat , it become truly threaten when they have come aboard .
They lay about the deck growl together in talk .
The slight order be receive with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obey .
Even the honest hand must have catch the infection , for there be not one man aboard to mend another .
Mutiny , it be plain , hung over u like a thunder-cloud .
And it be not only we of the cabin party who perceive the danger .
Long John be hard at work go from group to group , spend himself in good advice , and a for example no man could have show a good .
He fairly outstrip himself in willingness and civility ; he be all smile to everyone .
If an order be give , John would be on his crutch in an instant , with the cheery `` Aye , aye , sir ! ''
in the world ; and when there be nothing else to do , he keep up one song after another , a if to conceal the discontent of the rest .
Of all the gloomy feature of that gloomy afternoon , this obvious anxiety on the part of Long John appear the bad .
We hold a council in the cabin .
`` Sir , '' say the captain , `` if I risk another order , the whole ship 'll come about our ear by the run .
You see , sir , here it be .
I get a rough answer , do I not ?
Well , if I speak back , pike will be go in two shake ; if I do n't , Silver will see there 's something under that , and the game 's up .
Now , we 've only one man to rely on . ''
`` And who be that ? ''
ask the squire .
`` Silver , sir , '' return the captain ; `` he 's as anxious a you and I to smother thing up .
This be a tiff ; he 'd soon talk 'em out of it if he have the chance , and what I propose to do be to give him the chance .
Let 's allow the men an afternoon ashore .
If they all go , why we 'll fight the ship .
If they none of them go , well then , we hold the cabin , and God defend the right .
If some go , you mark my word , sir , Silver 'll bring 'em aboard again as mild a lamb . ''
It be so decided ; load pistol be serve out to all the sure men ; Hunter , Joyce , and Redruth be take into our confidence and receive the news with less surprise and a good spirit than we have look for , and then the captain go on deck and address the crew .
`` My lad , '' say he , `` we 've have a hot day and be all tired and out of sort .
A turn ashore 'll hurt nobody -- the boat be still in the water ; you can take the gig , and as many a please may go ashore for the afternoon .
I 'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown . ''
I believe the silly fellow must have think they would break their shin over treasure as soon a they be land , for they all come out of their sulk in a moment and give a cheer that start the echo in a faraway hill and send the bird once more flying and squall round the anchorage .
The captain be too bright to be in the way .
He whip out of sight in a moment , leave Silver to arrange the party , and I fancy it be as well he do so .
Had he be on deck , he could no longer so much a have pretend not to understand the situation .
It be as plain a day .
Silver be the captain , and a mighty rebellious crew he have of it .
The honest hand -- and I be soon to see it prove that there be such on board -- must have be very stupid fellow .
Or rather , I suppose the truth be this , that all hand be disaffect by the example of the ringleader -- only some more , some le ; and a few , be good fellow in the main , could neither be lead nor drive any far .
It be one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men .
At last , however , the party be make up .
Six fellow be to stay on board , and the remain thirteen , include Silver , begin to embark .
Then it be that there come into my head the first of the mad notion that contribute so much to save our life .
If six men be leave by Silver , it be plain our party could not take and fight the ship ; and since only six be leave , it be equally plain that the cabin party have no present need of my assistance .
It occur to me at once to go ashore .
In a jiffy I have slip over the side and curl up in the fore-sheets of the near boat , and almost at the same moment she shove off .
