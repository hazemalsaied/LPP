So Peter never tell that dream , nor do he write it down .
Instead , I remember see in his dream book , under the date of September fifteenth , an entry to this effect : -- `` Last nite i dremed a drem .
it wasent a polit drem so i wo n't rite it down . ''
The girl saw this entry but , to their credit be it tell , they never try to find out what the `` drem '' be .
As Peter say , they be `` lady '' in the best and true sense of that much abuse appellation .
Full of fun and frolic and mischief they be , with all the defect of their quality and all the wayward fault of youth .
But no indelicate thought or vulgar word could have be shape or utter in their presence .
Had any of u boys ever be guilty of such , Cecily 's pale face would have colour with the blush of outraged purity , Felicity 's golden head would have lift itself in the haughty indignation of insulted womanhood , and the Story Girl 's splendid eye would have flash with such anger and scorn as would have shrivel the very soul of the wretched culprit .
Dan be once guilty of swearing .
Uncle Alec whip him for it -- the only time he ever so punished any of his child .
But it be because Cecily cry all night that Dan be fill with save remorse and repentance .
He vow next day to Cecily that he would never swear again , and he keep his word .
All at once the Story Girl and Peter begin to forge ahead in the matter of dream .
Their dream suddenly become so lurid and dreadful and picturesque that it be hard for the rest of u to believe that they be not paint the lily rather freely in their account of them .
But the Story Girl be the soul of honour ; and Peter , early in life , have have his foot set in the path of truthfulness by his Aunt Jane and have never be know to stray from it .
When they assure u solemnly that their dream all happen exactly a they describe them we be compel to believe them .
But there be something up , we felt sure of that .
Peter and the Story Girl certainly have a secret between them , which they keep for a whole fortnight .
There be no find it out from the Story Girl .
She have a knack of keep secret , anyhow ; and , moreover , all that fortnight she be strangely cranky and petulant , and we find it be not wise to tease her .
She be not well , so Aunt Olivia tell Aunt Janet .
`` I do n't know what be the matter with the child , '' say the former anxiously .
`` She have n't seem like herself the past two week .
She complain of headache , and she have no appetite , and she be a dreadful colour .
I 'll have to see a doctor about her if she do n't get good soon . ''
`` Give her a good dose of Mexican Tea and try that first , '' say Aunt Janet .
`` I 've save many a doctor 's bill in my family by use Mexican Tea . ''
The Mexican Tea be duly administer , but produce no improvement in the condition of the Story Girl , who , however , go on dreaming after a fashion which soon make her dream book a veritable curiosity of literature .
`` If we ca n't soon find out what make Peter and the Story Girl dream like that , the rest of u might as well give up try to write dream book , '' say Felix discontentedly .
Finally , we do find out .
Felicity worm the secret out of Peter by the employment of Delilah wile , such a have be the undoing of many a miserable male creature since Samson 's day .
She first threaten that she would never speak to him again if he do n't tell her ; and then she promise him that , if he do , she would let him walk beside her to and from Sunday School all the rest of the summer , and carry her book for her .
Peter be not proof against this double attack .
He yield and tell the secret .
I expect the Story Girl would overwhelm him with scorn and indignation .
But she take it very coolly .
`` I know Felicity would get it out of him sometime , '' she say .
`` I think he have do well to hold out this long . ''
Peter and the Story Girl , so it appear , have woo wild dream to their pillow by the simple device of eat rich , indigestible thing before they go to bed .
Aunt Olivia know nothing about it , of course .
She permit them only a plain , wholesome lunch at bed-time .
But during the day the Story Girl would smuggle upstairs various tidbit from the pantry , put half in Peter 's room and half in her own ; and the result be these vision which have be our despair .
`` Last night I eat a piece of mince pie , '' she say , `` and a lot of pickle , and two grape jelly tart .
But I guess I overdo it , because I get real sick and could n't sleep at all , so of course I do n't have any dream .
I should have stop with the pie and pickle and leave the tart alone .
Peter do , and he have an elegant dream that Peg Bowen catch him and put him on to boil alive in that big black pot that hang outside her door .
He wake up before the water get hot , though .
Well , Miss Felicity , you 're pretty smart .
But how will you like to walk to Sunday School with a boy who wear patch trouser ? ''
`` I wo n't have to , '' say Felicity triumphantly .
`` Peter be have a new suit make .
It 's to be ready by Saturday .
I know that before I promise . ''
Having discover how to produce exciting dream , we all promptly follow the example of Peter and the Story Girl .
`` There be no chance for me to have any horrid dream , '' lament Sara Ray , `` because ma wo n't let me have anything at all to eat before I go to bed .
I do n't think it 's fair . ''
`` Ca n't you hide something away through the day a we do ? ''
ask Felicity .
`` No . ''
Sara shake her fawn-coloured head mournfully .
`` Ma always keep the pantry lock , for fear Judy Pineau will treat her friend . ''
For a week we eat unlawful lunch and dream dream after our own heart -- and , I regret to say , bicker and squabble incessantly throughout the daytime , for our digestion go out of order and our temper follow suit .
Even the Story Girl and I have a fight -- something that have never happen before .
Peter be the only one who keep his normal poise .
Nothing could upset that boy 's stomach .
One night Cecily come into the pantry with a large cucumber , and proceed to devour the great part of it .
The grown-ups be away that even , attend a lecture at Markdale , so we eat our snack openly , without any recourse to way that be dark .
I remember I sup that night off a solid hunk of fat pork , top off with a slab of cold plum pudding .
`` I think you do n't like cucumber , Cecily , '' Dan remark .
`` Neither I do , '' say Cecily with a grimace .
`` But Peter say they 're splendid for dream .
He et one that night he have the dream about be catch by cannibal .
I 'd eat three cucumber if I could have a dream like that . ''
Cecily finish her cucumber , and then drink a glass of milk , just a we hear the wheel of Uncle Alec 's buggy rambling over the bridge in the hollow .
Felicity quickly restore pork and pudding to their own place , and by the time Aunt Janet come in we be all in our respective bed .
Soon the house be dark and silent .
I be just drop into an uneasy slumber when I hear a commotion in the girl ' room across the hall .
Their door open and through our own open door I saw Felicity 's white-clad figure flit down the stair to Aunt Janet 's room .
From the room she have leave come moan and cry .
`` Cecily 's sick , '' say Dan , spring out of bed .
`` That cucumber must have disagree with her . ''
In a few minute the whole house be astir .
Cecily be sick -- very , very sick , there be no doubt of that .
She be even bad than Dan have be when he have eat the bad berry .
Uncle Alec , tire a he be from his hard day 's work and even outing , be despatch for the doctor .
Aunt Janet and Felicity administer all the homely remedy they could think of , but to no effect .
Felicity tell Aunt Janet of the cucumber , but Aunt Janet do not think the cucumber alone could be responsible for Cecily 's alarm condition .
`` Cucumbers be indigestible , but I never know of them make any one as sick a this , '' she say anxiously .
`` What make the child eat a cucumber before go to bed ?
I do n't think she like them . ''
`` It be that wretched Peter , '' sob Felicity indignantly .
`` He tell her it would make her dream something extra . ''
`` What on earth do she want to dream for ? ''
demanded Aunt Janet in bewilderment .
`` Oh , to have something worth while to write in her dream book , ma .
We all have dream book , you know , and every one want their own to be the most exciting -- and we 've be eat rich thing to make u dream -- and it do -- but if Cecily -- oh , I 'll never forgive myself , '' say Felicity , incoherently , let all kind of cat out of the bag in her excitement and alarm .
`` Well , I wonder what on earth you young one will do next , '' say Aunt Janet in the helpless tone of a woman who give it up .
Cecily be no good when the doctor come .
Like Aunt Janet , he declare that cucumber alone would not have make her so ill ; but when he find out that she have drunk a glass of milk also the mystery be solve .
`` Why , milk and cucumber together make a rank poison , '' he say .
`` No wonder the child be sick .
There -- there now -- '' see the alarmed face around him , `` do n't be frighten .
As old Mrs. Fraser say , ` It 's no deidly . '
It wo n't kill her , but she 'll probably be a pretty miserable girl for two or three day . ''
She be .
And we be all miserable in company .
Aunt Janet investigate the whole affair and the matter of our dream book be air in family conclave .
I do not know which hurt our feeling most -- the scolding we get from Aunt Janet , or the ridicule which the other grown-ups , especially Uncle Roger , shower on u .
Peter receive an extra `` set down , '' which he consider rank injustice .
`` I do n't tell Cecily to drink the milk , and the cucumber alone would n't have hurt her , '' he grumble .
Cecily be able to be out with u again that day , so Peter felt that he might venture on a grumble . ''
` Sides , she coax me to tell her what would be good for dream .
I just tell her a a favour .
And now your Aunt Janet blame me for the whole trouble . ''
`` And Aunt Janet say we be never to have anything to eat before we go to bed after this except plain bread and milk , '' say Felix sadly .
`` They 'd like to stop u from dream altogether if they could , '' say the Story Girl wrathfully .
`` Well , anyway , they ca n't prevent u from grow up , '' console Dan .
`` We need n't worry about the bread and milk rule , '' add Felicity .
`` Ma make a rule like that once before , and keep it for a week , and then we just slip back to the old way .
That will be what will happen this time , too .
But of course we wo n't be able to get any more rich thing for supper , and our dream will be pretty flat after this . ''
`` Well , let 's go down to the Pulpit Stone and I 'll tell you a story I know , '' say the Story Girl .
We go -- and straightway drank of the water of forgetfulness .
In a brief space we be laugh right merrily , no longer remember our wrong at the hand of those cruel grown-ups .
Our laughter echo back from the barn and the spruce grove , a if elfin denizen of upper air be share in our mirth .
Presently , also , the laughter of the grown-ups mingle with ours .
Aunt Olivia and Uncle Roger , Aunt Janet and Uncle Alec , come stroll through the orchard and join our circle , a they sometimes do when the toil of the day be over , and the magic time ` twixt light and dark bring truce of care and labour .
'T be then we like our grown-ups best , for then they seem half child again .
Uncle Roger and Uncle Alec loll in the grass like boy ; Aunt Olivia , look more like a pansy than ever in the pretty dress of pale purple print , with a knot of yellow ribbon at her throat , sit with her arm about Cecily and smile on u all ; and Aunt Janet 's motherly face lose it every-day look of anxious care .
The Story Girl be in great fettle that night .
Never have her tale sparkle with such wit and archness .
`` Sara Stanley , '' say Aunt Olivia , shake her finger at her after a side-splitting yarn , `` if you do n't watch out you 'll be famous some day . ''
`` These funny story be all right , '' say Uncle Roger , `` but for real enjoyment give me something with a creep in it .
Sara , tell u that story of the Serpent Woman I hear you tell one day last summer . ''
The Story Girl begin it glibly .
But before she have go far with it , I , who be sit beside her , felt an unaccountable repulsion creeping over me .
For the first time since I have know her I want to draw away from the Story Girl .
Looking around on the face of the group , I saw that they all share my feeling .
Cecily have put her hand over her eye .
Peter be star at the Story Girl with a fascinate , horror-strickened gaze .
Aunt Olivia be pale and troubled .
All look a if they be hold prisoner in the bond of a fearsome spell which they would gladly break but could not .
It be not our Story Girl who sit there , tell that weird tale in a sibilant , curdle voice .
She have put on a new personality like a garment , and that personality be a venomous , evil , loathly thing .
I would rather have die than have touch the slim , brown wrist on which she support herself .
The light in her narrowed orb be the cold , merciless gleam of the serpent 's eye .
I felt frighten of this unholy creature who have suddenly come in our dear Story Girl 's place .
When the tale end there be a brief silence .
Then Aunt Janet say severely , but with a sigh of relief , `` Little girl should n't tell such horrible story . ''
This truly Aunt Janetian remark break the spell .
The grown-ups laugh , rather shakily , and the Story Girl -- our own dear Story Girl once more , and no Serpent Woman -- say protestingly , `` Well , Uncle Roger ask me to tell it .
I do n't like tell such story either .
They make me feel dreadful .
Do you know , for just a little while , I felt exactly like a snake . ''
`` You look like one , '' say Uncle Roger .
`` How on earth do you do it ? ''
`` I ca n't explain how I do it , '' say the Story Girl perplexedly .
`` It just do itself . ''
Genius can never explain how it do it .
It would not be genius if it could .
And the Story Girl have genius .
As we leave the orchard I walk along behind Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia .
`` That be an uncanny exhibition for a girl of fourteen , you know , Roger , '' say Aunt Olivia musingly .
`` What be in store for that child ? ''
`` Fame , '' say Uncle Roger .
`` If she ever have a chance , that be , and I suppose her father will see to that .
At least , I hope he will .
You and I , Olivia , never have our chance .
I hope Sara will have hers . ''
This be my first inkling of what I be to understand more fully in late year .
Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia have both cherish certain dream and ambition in youth , but circumstance have deny them their `` chance '' and those dream have never be fulfil .
`` Some day , Olivia , '' go on Uncle Roger , `` you and I may find ourselves the aunt and uncle of the foremost actress of her day .
If a girl of fourteen can make a couple of practical farmer and a pair of matter-of-fact housewife half believe for ten minute that she really be a snake , what wo n't she be able to do when she be thirty ?
Here , you , '' add Uncle Roger , perceive me , `` cut along and get off to your bed .
And mind you do n't eat cucumber and milk before you go . ''
CHAPTER XXIV .
THE BEWITCHMENT OF PAT We be all in the doleful dump -- at least , all we `` young fry '' be , and even the grown-ups be sorry and condescend to take an interest in our trouble .
Pat , our own , dear , frolicsome Paddy , be sick again -- very , very sick .
On Friday he mop and refuse his saucer of new milk at milking time .
The next morning he stretch himself down on the platform by Uncle Roger 's back door , lay his head on his black paw , and refuse to take any notice of anything or anybody .
In vain we stroke and entreat and bring him tidbit .
Only when the Story Girl caress him do he give one plaintive little mew , a if to ask piteously why she could not do something for him .
At that Cecily and Felicity and Sara Ray all begin cry , and we boys felt choky .
Indeed , I catch Peter behind Aunt Olivia 's dairy later in the day , and if ever a boy have be cry I vow that boy be Peter .
Nor do he deny it when I tax him with it , but he would not give in that he be cry about Paddy .
Nonsense !
`` What be you cry for , then ? ''
I say .
`` I 'm cry because -- because my Aunt Jane be dead , '' say Peter defiantly .
`` But your Aunt Jane die two year ago , '' I say skeptically .
`` Well , ai n't that all the more reason for cry ? ''
retort Peter .
`` I 've have to do without her for two year , and that 's bad than if it have just be a few day . ''
`` I believe you be cry because Pat be so sick , '' I say firmly .
`` As if I 'd cry about a cat ! ''
scoffed Peter .
And he march off whistling .
Of course we have try the lard and powder treatment again , smear Pat 's paw and side liberally .
But to our dismay , Pat make no effort to lick it off .
`` I tell you he 's a mighty sick cat , '' say Peter darkly .
`` When a cat do n't care what he look like he 's pretty far go . ''
`` If we only know what be the matter with him we might do something , '' sob the Story Girl , stroke her poor pet 's unresponsive head .
`` I could tell you what 's the matter with him , but you 'd only laugh at me , '' say Peter .
We all look at him .
`` Peter Craig , what do you mean ? ''
ask Felicity . ''
` Zackly what I say . ''
`` Then , if you know what be the matter with Paddy , tell u , '' command the Story Girl , stand up .
She say it quietly ; but Peter obey .
I think he would have obey if she , in that tone and with those eye , have order him to cast himself into the depth of the sea .
I know I should .
`` He 's BEWITCHED -- that 's what 's the matter with him , '' say Peter , half defiantly , half shamefacedly .
`` Bewitched ?
Nonsense ! ''
`` There now , what do I tell you ? ''
complain Peter .
The Story Girl look at Peter , at the rest of u , and then at poor Pat .
`` How could he be bewitch ? ''
she ask irresolutely , `` and who could bewitch him ? ''
`` I do n't know HOW he be bewitch , '' say Peter .
`` I 'd have to be a witch myself to know that .
But Peg Bowen bewitch him . ''
`` Nonsense ! ''
say the Story Girl again .
`` All right , '' say Peter .
`` You do n't have to believe me . ''
`` If Peg Bowen could bewitch anything -- and I do n't believe she could -- why should she bewitch Pat ? ''
ask the Story Girl .
`` Everybody here and at Uncle Alec 's be always kind to her . ''
`` I 'll tell you why , '' say Peter .
`` Thursday afternoon , when you fellows be all in school , Peg Bowen come here .
Your Aunt Olivia give her a lunch -- a good one .
You may laugh at the notion of Peg be a witch , but I notice your folk be always awful good to her when she come , and awful careful never to offend her . ''
`` Aunt Olivia would be good to any poor creature , and so would mother , '' say Felicity .
`` And of course nobody want to offend Peg , because she be spiteful , and she once set fire to a man 's barn in Markdale when he offend her .
But she be n't a witch -- that 's ridiculous . ''
`` All right .
But wait till I tell you .
When Peg Bowen be leave Pat stretch out on the step .
She tramp on his tail .
You know Pat do n't like to have his tail meddle with .
He slew himself round and claw her bare foot .
If you 'd just see the look she give him you 'd know whether she be a witch or not .
And she go off down the lane , mutter and throw her hand round , just like she do in Lem Hill 's cow pasture .
She put a spell on Pat , that 's what she do .
He be sick the next morning . ''
We look at each other in miserable , perplexed silence .
We be only child -- and we believe that there have be such thing a witch once upon a time -- and Peg Bowen WAS an eerie creature .
`` If that 's so -- though I ca n't believe it -- we ca n't do anything , '' say the Story Girl drearily .
`` Pat must die . ''
Cecily begin to weep afresh .
`` I 'd do anything to save Pat 's life , '' she say .
`` I 'd BELIEVE anything . ''
`` There 's nothing we can do , '' say Felicity impatiently .
`` I suppose , '' sob Cecily , `` we might go to Peg Bowen and ask her to forgive Pat and take the spell off him .
She might , if we apologize real humble . ''
At first we be appal by the suggestion .
We do n't believe that Peg Bowen be a witch .
But to go to her -- to seek her out in that mysterious woodland retreat of hers which be invest with all the terror of the unknown !
And that this suggestion should come from timid Cecily , of all people !
But then , there be poor Pat !
`` Would it do any good ? ''
say the Story Girl desperately .
`` Even if she do make Pat sick I suppose it would only make her crosser if we go and accuse her of bewitch him .
Besides , she do n't do anything of the sort . ''
But there be some uncertainty in the Story Girl 's voice .
`` It would n't do any harm to try , '' say Cecily .
`` If she do n't make him sick it wo n't matter if she be cross . ''
`` It wo n't matter to Pat , but it might to the one who go to her , '' say Felicity .
`` She be n't a witch , but she 's a spiteful old woman , and goodness know what she 'd do to u if she catch u .
I 'm scared of Peg Bowen , and I do n't care who know it .
Ever since I can mind ma 's be say , ` If you 're not good Peg Bowen will catch you . ' ''
`` If I think she really make Pat sick and could make him good , I 'd try to pacify her somehow , '' say the Story Girl decidedly .
`` I 'm frightened of her , too -- but just look at poor , darling Paddy . ''
We look at Paddy who continue to stare fixedly before him with unwinking eye .
Uncle Roger come out and look at him also , with what seem to u positively brutal unconcern .
`` I 'm afraid it 's all up with Pat , '' he say .
`` Uncle Roger , '' say Cecily imploringly , `` Peter say Peg Bowen have bewitch Pat for scratch her .
Do you think it can be so ? ''
`` Did Pat scratch Peg ? ''
ask Uncle Roger , with a horror-stricken face .
`` Dear me !
Dear me !
That mystery be solve .
Poor Pat ! ''
Uncle Roger nod his head , a if resign himself and Pat to the bad .
`` Do you really think Peg Bowen be a witch , Uncle Roger ? ''
demand the Story Girl incredulously .
`` Do I think Peg Bowen be a witch ?
My dear Sara , what do YOU think of a woman who can turn herself into a black cat whenever she like ?
Is she a witch ?
Or be she not ?
I leave it to you . ''
`` Can Peg Bowen turn herself into a black cat ? ''
ask Felix , star .
`` It 's my belief that that be the least of Peg Bowen 's accomplishment , '' answer Uncle Roger .
`` It 's the easy thing in the world for a witch to turn herself into any animal you choose to mention .
Yes , Pat be bewitch -- no doubt of that -- not the least in the world . ''
`` What be you tell those child such stuff for ? ''
ask Aunt Olivia , pass on her way to the well .
`` It 's an irresistible temptation , '' answer Uncle Roger , stroll over to carry her pail .
`` You can see your Uncle Roger believe Peg be a witch , '' say Peter .
`` And you can see Aunt Olivia do n't , '' I say , `` and I do n't either . ''
`` See here , '' say the Story Girl resolutely , `` I do n't believe it , but there MAY be something in it .
Suppose there be .
The question be , what can we do ? ''
`` I 'll tell you what I 'D do , '' say Peter .
`` I 'd take a present for Peg , and ask her to make Pat well .
I would n't let on I think she 'd make him sick .
Then she could n't be offend -- and maybe she 'd take the spell off . ''
`` I think we 'd better all give her something , '' say Felicity .
`` I 'm willing to do that .
But who 's go to take the present to her ? ''
`` We must all go together , '' say the Story Girl .
`` I wo n't , '' cry Sara Ray in terror .
`` I would n't go near Peg Bowen 's house for the world , no matter who be with me . ''
`` I 've think of a plan , '' say the Story Girl .
`` Let 's all give her something , a Felicity say .
And let u all go up to her place this evening , and if we see her outside we 'll just go quietly and set the thing down before her with the letter , and say nothing but come respectfully away . ''
`` If she 'll let u , '' say Dan significantly .
`` Can Peg read a letter ? ''
I ask .
`` Oh , yes .
Aunt Olivia say she be a good scholar .
She go to school and be a smart girl until she become crazy .
We 'll write it very plain . ''
`` What if we do n't see her ? ''
ask Felicity .
`` We 'll put the thing on her doorstep then and leave them . ''
`` She may be mile away over the country by this time , '' sigh Cecily , `` and never find them until it 's too late for Pat .
But it 's the only thing to do .
What can we give her ? ''
`` We must n't offer her any money , '' say the Story Girl .
`` She 's very indignant when any one do that .
She say she be n't a beggar .
But she 'll take anything else .
I shall give her my string of blue bead .
She 's fond of finery . ''
`` I 'll give her that sponge cake I make this morning , '' say Felicity .
`` I guess she do n't get sponge cake very often . ''
`` I 've nothing but the rheumatism ring I get a a premium for sell needle last winter , '' say Peter .
`` I 'll give her that .
Even if she have n't get rheumatism it 's a real handsome ring .
It look like solid gold . ''
`` I 'll give her a roll of peppermint candy , '' say Felix .
`` I 'll give one of those little jar of cherry preserve I make , '' say Cecily .
`` I wo n't go near her , '' quaver Sara Ray , `` but I want to do something for Pat , and I 'll send that piece of apple leaf lace I knit last week . ''
I decide to give the redoubtable Peg some apple from my birthday tree , and Dan declare he would give her a plug of tobacco .
`` Oh , wo n't she be insult ? ''
exclaim Felix , rather horrify .
`` Naw , '' grin Dan .
`` Peg chew tobacco like a man .
She 'd rather have it than your rubbishy peppermint , I can tell you .
I 'll run down to old Mrs. Sampson 's and get a plug . ''
`` Now , we must write the letter and take it and the present to her right away , before it get dark , '' say the Story Girl .
We adjourn to the granary to indite the important document , which the Story Girl be to compose .
`` How shall I begin it ? ''
she ask in perplexity .
`` It would never do to say , ` Dear Peg , ' and ` Dear Miss Bowen ' sound too ridiculous . ''
`` Besides , nobody know whether she be Miss Bowen or not , '' say Felicity .
`` She go to Boston when she grow up , and some say she be marry there and her husband desert her , and that 's why she go crazy .
If she 's married , she wo n't like be call Miss. '' `` Well , how be I to address her ? ''
ask the Story Girl in despair .
Peter again come to the rescue with a practical suggestion .
`` Begin it , ` Respected Madam , ' '' he say .
`` Ma have a letter a school trustee once writ to my Aunt Jane and that 's how it begin . ''
`` Respected Madam , '' write the Story Girl .
`` We want to ask a very great favour of you and we hope you will kindly grant it if you can .
Our favourite cat , Paddy , be very sick , and we be afraid he be go to die .
Do you think you could cure him ?
And will you please try ?
We be all so fond of him , and he be such a good cat , and have no bad habit .
Of course , if any of u tramp on his tail he will scratch u , but you know a cat ca n't bear to have his tail tramp on .
It 's a very tender part of him , and it 's his only way of prevent it , and he do n't mean any harm .
If you can cure Paddy for u we will always be very , very grateful to you .
The accompany small offering be a testimonial of our respect and gratitude , and we entreat you to honour u by accept them .
`` Very respectfully yours , `` SARA STANLEY . ''
`` I tell you that last sentence have a fine sound , '' say Peter admiringly .
`` I do n't make that up , '' admit the Story Girl honestly .
`` I read it somewhere and remember it . ''
`` I think it 's TOO fine , '' criticize Felicity .
`` Peg Bowen wo n't know the meaning of such big word . ''
But it be decide to leave them in and we all sign the letter .
Then we get our `` testimonial , '' and start on our reluctant journey to the domain of the witch .
Sara Ray would not go , of course , but she volunteer to stay with Pat while we be away .
We do not think it necessary to inform the grown-ups of our errand , or it nature .
Grown-ups have such peculiar view .
They might forbid our go at all -- and they would certainly laugh at u .
Peg Bowen 's house be nearly a mile away , even by the short cut past the swamp and up the wooded hill .
We go down through the brook field and over the little plank bridge in the hollow , half lose in it surround sea of farewell summer .
When we reach the green gloom of the wood beyond we begin to feel frightened , but nobody would admit it .
We walk very closely together , and we do not talk .
When you be near the retreat of witch and folk of that ilk the le you say the good , for their feeling be so notoriously touchy .
Of course , Peg be n't a witch , but it be best to be on the safe side .
Finally we come to the lane which lead directly to her abode .
We be all very pale now , and our heart be beat .
The red September sun hang low between the tall spruce to the west .
It do not look to me just right for a sun .
In fact , everything look uncanny .
I wish our errand be well over .
A sudden bend in the lane bring u out to the little clearing where Peg 's house be before we be half ready to see it .
In spite of my fear I look at it with some curiosity .
It be a small , shaky building with a sag roof , set amid a perfect jungle of weed .
To our eye , the odd thing about it be that there be no entrance on the ground floor , a there should be in any respectable house .
The only door be in the upper story , and be reach by a flight of rickety step .
There be no sign of life about the place except -- sight of ill omen -- a large black cat , sit on the topmost step .
We think of Uncle Roger 's gruesome hint .
Could that black cat be Peg ?
Nonsense !
But still -- it do n't look like an ordinary cat .
It be so large -- and have such green , malicious eye !
Plainly , there be something out of the common about the beastie !
In a tense , breathless silence the Story Girl place our parcel on the low step , and lay her letter on the top of the pile .
Her brown finger tremble and her face be very pale .
Suddenly the door above u open , and Peg Bowen herself appear on the threshold .
She be a tall , sinewy old woman , wear a short , ragged , drugget skirt which reach scantly below her knee , a scarlet print blouse , and a man 's hat .
Her foot , arm , and neck be bare , and she have a batter old clay pipe in her mouth .
Her brown face be seam with a hundred wrinkle , and her tangled , grizzled hair fell unkemptly over her shoulder .
She be scowl , and her flashing black eye hold no friendly light .
We have bear up bravely enough hitherto , in spite of our inward , unconfessed quakings .
But now our strained nerve give way , and sheer panic seize u .
Peter give a little yelp of pure terror .
We turn and flee across the clearing and into the wood .
Down the long hill we tear , like mad , hunt creature , firmly convince that Peg Bowen be after u .
Wild be that scamper , as nightmare-like a any record in our dream book .
The Story Girl be in front of me , and I can recall the tremendous leap she make over fallen log and little spruce bush , with her long brown curl stream out behind her from their scarlet fillet .
Cecily , behind me , keep gasp out the contradictory sentence , `` Oh , Bev , wait for me , '' and `` Oh , Bev , hurry , hurry ! ''
More by blind instinct than anything else we keep together and find our way out of the wood .
Presently we be in the field beyond the brook .
Over u be a dainty sky of shell pink , placid cow be pasture around u ; the farewell summer nod to u in the friendly breeze .
We halt , with a glad realization that we be back in our own haunt and that Peg Bowen have not catch u .
`` Oh , be n't that an awful experience ? ''
gasp Cecily , shudder .
`` I would n't go through it again -- I could n't , not even for Pat . ''
`` It come on a fellow so suddent , '' say Peter shamefacedly .
`` I think I could a-stood my ground if I 'd know she be go to come out .
But when she pop out like that I think I be do for . ''
`` We should n't have run , '' say Felicity gloomily .
`` It show we be afraid of her , and that always make her awful cross .
She wo n't do a thing for Pat now . ''
`` I do n't believe she could do anything , anyway , '' say the Story Girl .
`` I think we 've just be a lot of geese . ''
We be all , except Peter , more or less inclined to agree with her .
And the conviction of our folly deepen when we reach the granary and find that Pat , watch over by the faithful Sara Ray , be no good .
The Story Girl announce that she would take him into the kitchen and sit up all night with him .
`` He sha 'n ' t die alone , anyway , '' she say miserably , gather his limp body up in her arm .
We do not think Aunt Olivia would give her permission to stay up ; but Aunt Olivia do .
Aunt Olivia really be a duck .
We want to stay with her also , but Aunt Janet would n't hear of such a thing .
She order u off to bed , say that it be positively sinful in u to be so work up over a cat .
Five heart-broken child , who know that there be many bad friend than dumb , furry folk , climb Uncle Alec 's stair to bed that night .
`` There 's nothing we can do now , except pray God to make Pat good , '' say Cecily .
I must candidly say that her tone savour strongly of a last resort ; but this be owe more to early training than to any lack of faith on Cecily 's part .
She know and we know , that prayer be a solemn rite , not to be lightly hold , nor degrade to common us .
Felicity voice this conviction when she say , `` I do n't believe it would be right to pray about a cat . ''
`` I 'd like to know why not , '' retort Cecily , `` God make Paddy just as much a He make you , Felicity King , though perhaps He do n't go to so much trouble .
And I 'm sure He 's abler to help him than Peg Bowen .
Anyhow , I 'm go to pray for Pat with all my might and main , and I 'd like to see you try to stop me .
Of course I wo n't mix it up with more important thing .
I 'll just tack it on after I 've finish ask the blessing , but before I say amen . ''
More petition than Cecily 's be offer up that night on behalf of Paddy .
I distinctly hear Felix -- who always say his prayer in a loud whisper , owe to some lasting conviction of early life that God could not hear him if he do not pray audibly -- mutter pleadingly , after the `` important '' part of his devotion be over , `` Oh , God , please make Pat good by the morning .
PLEASE do . ''
And I , even in these late year of irreverence for the dream of youth , be not in the least ashamed to confess that when I kneel down to say my boyish prayer , I think of our little furry comrade in his extremity , and pray as reverently a I know how for his healing .
Then I go to sleep , comfort by the simple hope that the Great Father would , after `` important thing '' be all attend to , remember poor Pat .
As soon a we be up the next morning we rush off to Uncle Roger 's .
But we meet Peter and the Story Girl in the lane , and their face be a the face of those who bring glad tidings upon the mountain .
`` Pat 's better , '' cry the Story Girl , blithe , triumphant .
`` Last night , just at twelve , he begin to lick his paw .
Then he lick himself all over and go to sleep , too , on the sofa .
When I wake Pat be wash his face , and he have take a whole saucerful of milk .
Oh , be n't it splendid ? ''
`` You see Peg Bowen do put a spell on him , '' say Peter , `` and then she take it off . ''
`` I guess Cecily 's prayer have more to do with Pat 's get good than Peg Bowen , '' say Felicity .
`` She pray for Pat over and over again .
That be why he 's good . ''
`` Oh , all right , '' say Peter , `` but I 'd advise Pat not to scratch Peg Bowen again , that 's all . ''
`` I wish I know whether it be the praying or Peg Bowen that cure Pat , '' say Felix in perplexity .
`` I do n't believe it be either of them , '' say Dan .
`` Pat just get sick and get well again of his own accord . ''
`` I 'm go to believe that it be the praying , '' say Cecily decidedly .
`` It 's so much nicer to believe that God cure Pat than that Peg Bowen do . ''
`` But you ought n't to believe a thing just 'cause it would be more comfortable , '' object Peter .
`` Mind you , I ai n't say God could n't cure Pat .
But nothing and nobody ca n't ever make me believe that Peg Bowen be n't at the bottom of it all . ''
Thus faith , superstition , and incredulity strive together amongst u , a in all history .
CHAPTER XXV .
A CUP OF FAILURE One warm Sunday evening in the moon of golden-rod , we all , grown-ups and child , be sit in the orchard by the Pulpit Stone sing sweet old gospel hymn .
We could all sing more or less , except poor Sara Ray , who have once despairingly confide to me that she do n't know what she 'd ever do when she go to heaven , because she could n't sing a note .
That whole scene come out clearly for me in memory -- the arc of primrose sky over the tree behind the old house , the fruit-laden bough of the orchard , the bank of golden-rod , like a wave of sunshine , behind the Pulpit Stone , the nameless colour see on a fir wood in a ruddy sunset .
I can see Uncle Alec 's tired , brilliant , blue eye , Aunt Janet 's wholesome , matronly face , Uncle Roger 's sweeping blond beard and red cheek , and Aunt Olivia 's full-blown beauty .
Two voice ring out for me above all others in the music that echo through the hall of recollection .
Cecily 's sweet and silvery , and Uncle Alec 's fine tenor .
`` If you 're a King , you sing , '' be a Carlisle proverb in those day .
Aunt Julia have be the flower of the flock in that respect and have become a noted concert singer .
The world have never hear of the rest .
Their music echo only along the hidden way of life , and serve but to lighten the care of the trivial round and common task .
That evening , after they tire of singing , our grown-ups begin talk of their youthful day and doings .
This be always a keen delight to u small fry .
We listen avidly to the tale of our uncle and aunt in the day when they , too -- hard fact to realize -- have be child .
Good and proper a they be now , once , so it seem , they have get into mischief and even have their quarrel and disagreement .
On this particular evening Uncle Roger tell many story of Uncle Edward , and one in which the say Edward have preach sermon at the mature age of ten from the Pulpit Stone fire , a the sequel will show , the Story Girl 's imagination .
`` Ca n't I just see him at it now , '' say Uncle Roger , `` leaning over that old boulder , his cheek red and his eye burn with excitement , bang the top of it a he have see the minister do in church .
It be n't cushion , however , and he always bruise his hand in his self-forgetful earnestness .
We think him a regular wonder .
We love to hear him preach , but we do n't like to hear him pray , because he always insist on pray for each of u by name , and it make u feel wretchedly uncomfortable , somehow .
Alec , do you remember how furious Julia be because Edward pray one day that she might be preserve from vanity and conceit over her singing ? ''
`` I should think I do , '' laugh Uncle Alec .
`` She be sit right there where Cecily be now , and she get up at once and march right out of the orchard , but at the gate she turn to call back indignantly , ' I guess you 'd better wait till you 've pray the conceit out of yourself before you begin on me , Ned King .
I never hear such stuck-up sermon a you preach . '
Ned go on praying and never let on he hear her , but at the end of his prayer he wind up with ` Oh , God , I pray you to keep an eye on u all , but I pray you to pay particular attention to my sister Julia , for I think she need it even more than the rest of u , world without end , Amen . ' ''
Our uncle roar with laughter over the recollection .
We all laugh , indeed , especially over another tale in which Uncle Edward , lean too far over the `` pulpit '' in his earnestness , lose his balance altogether and tumble ingloriously into the grass below .
`` He light on a big Scotch thistle , '' say Uncle Roger , chuckling , `` and besides that , he skin his forehead on a stone .
But he be determine to finish his sermon , and finish it he do .
He climb back into the pulpit , with the tear roll over his cheek , and preach for ten minute longer , with sob in his voice and drop of blood on his forehead .
He be a plucky little beggar .
No wonder he succeed in life . ''
`` And his sermon and prayer be always just about as outspoken a those Julia object to , '' say Uncle Alec .
`` Well , we 're all get on in life and Edward be gray ; but when I think of him I always see him a little , rosy , curly-headed chap , lay down the law to u from the Pulpit Stone .
It seem like the other day that we be all here together , just a these child be , and now we be scatter everywhere .
Julia in California , Edward in Halifax , Alan in South America , Felix and Felicity and Stephen go to the land that be very far off . ''
There be a little space of silence ; and then Uncle Alec begin , in a low , impressive voice , to repeat the wonderful verse of the ninetieth Psalm -- verse which be thenceforth bind up for u with the beauty of that night and the memory of our kindred .
Very reverently we all listen to the majestic word .
`` Lord , thou hast be our dwell place in all generation .
Before the mountain be bring forth , or ever thou hadst form the earth and the world , even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God ... For a thousand year in thy sight be but a yesterday when it be past , and a a watch in the night ... For all our day be pass away in thy wrath ; we spend our year a a tale that be tell .
The day of our year be threescore and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore year yet be their strength , labour and sorrow ; for it be soon cut off and we fly away ... So teach u to number our day that we may apply our heart unto wisdom ... Oh , satisfy u early with thy mercy ; that we may rejoice and be glad all our day ... And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon u ; and establish thou the work of our hand upon u ; yea , the work of our hand establish thou it . ''
The dusk crept into the orchard like a dim , bewitch personality .
You could see her -- feel her -- hear her .
She tiptoe softly from tree to tree , ever draw nearer .
Presently her filmy wing hover over u and through them gleam the early star of the autumn night .
The grown-ups rise reluctantly and stroll away ; but we child linger for a moment to talk over an idea the Story Girl broach -- a good idea , we think enthusiastically , and one that promise to add considerable spice to life .
We be on the lookout for some new amusement .
Dream book have begin to pall .
We no longer write in them very regularly , and our dream be not what they use to be before the mischance of the cucumber .
So the Story Girl 's suggestion come pat to the psychological moment .
` I 've think of a splendid plan , '' she say .
`` It just flash into my mind when the uncle be talk about Uncle Edward .
And the beauty of it be we can play it on Sundays , and you know there be so few thing it be proper to play on Sundays .
But this be a Christian game , so it will be all right . ''
`` It be n't like the religious fruit basket game , be it ? ''
ask Cecily anxiously .
We have good reason to hope that it be n't .
One desperate Sunday afternoon , when we have nothing to read and the time seem endless , Felix have suggest that we have a game of fruit-basket ; only instead of take the name of fruit , we be to take the name of Bible character .
This , he argue , would make it quite lawful and proper to play on Sunday .
We , too desirous of be convince , also think so ; and for a merry hour Lazarus and Martha and Moses and Aaron and sundry other worthy of Holy Writ have a lively time of it in the King orchard .
Peter have a Scriptural name of his own , do not want to take another ; but we would not allow this , because it would give him an unfair advantage over the rest of u .
It would be so much easy to call out your own name than fit your tongue to an unfamiliar one .
So Peter retaliate by choose Nebuchadnezzar , which no one could ever utter three time before Peter shriek it out once .
In the midst of our hilarity , however , Uncle Alec and Aunt Janet come down upon u .
It be best to draw a veil over what follow .
Suffice it to say that the recollection give point to Cecily 's question .
`` No , it be n't that sort of game at all , '' say the Story Girl .
`` It be this ; each of you boys must preach a sermon , a Uncle Edward use to do .
One of you next Sunday , and another the next , and so on .
And whoever preach the best sermon be to get a prize . ''
Dan promptly declare he would n't try to preach a sermon ; but Peter , Felix and I think the suggestion a very good one .
Secretly , I believe I could cut quite a fine figure preach a sermon .
`` Who 'll give the prize ? ''
ask Felix .
`` I will , '' say the Story Girl .
`` I 'll give that picture father send me last week . ''
As the say picture be an excellent copy of one of Landseer 's stag , Felix and I be well pleased ; but Peter aver that he would rather have the Madonna that look like his Aunt Jane , and the Story Girl agree that if his sermon be the best she would give him that .
`` But who 's to be the judge ? ''
I say , `` and what kind of a sermon would you call the best ? ''
`` The one that make the most impression , '' answer the Story Girl promptly .
`` And we girl must be the judge , because there 's nobody else .
Now , who be to preach next Sunday ? ''
It be decide that I should lead off , and I lay awake for an extra hour that night think what text I should take for the following Sunday .
The next day I buy two sheet of foolscap from the schoolmaster , and after tea I betook myself to the granary , bar the door , and fell to write my sermon .
I do not find it a easy a task a I have anticipate ; but I peg grimly away at it , and by dint of severe labour for two evening I eventually get my four page of foolscap fill , although I have to pad the subject-matter not a little with verse of quotable hymn .
I have decide to preach on mission , a be a topic more within my grasp than abstruse theological doctrine or evangelical discourse ; and , mindful of the need of make an impression , I draw a harrowing picture of the miserable plight of the heathen who in their darkness bow down to wood and stone .
Then I urge our responsibility concern them , and meant to wind up by recite , in a very solemn and earnest voice , the verse beginning , `` Can we whose soul be light . ''
When I have complete my sermon I go over it very carefully again and write with red ink -- Cecily make it for me out of an aniline dye -- the word `` thump '' wherever I deem it advisable to chastise the pulpit .
I have that sermon still , all it red thump unfaded , lie beside my dream book ; but I be not go to inflict it on my reader .
I be not so proud of it a I once be .
I be really puff up with earthly vanity over it at that time .
Felix , I think , would be hard put to it to beat it .
As for Peter , I do not consider him a rival to be fear .
It be unsupposable that a hired boy , with little education and less experience of church-going , should be able to preach good than could I , in whose family there be a real minister .
The sermon write , the next thing be to learn it off by heart and then practise it , thump include , until I be letter and gesture perfect .
I preach it over several time in the granary with only Paddy , sit immovably on a puncheon , for audience .
Paddy stand the test fairly well .
At least , he make an adorable listener , save at such time a imaginary rat distract his attention .
Mr. Marwood have at least three absorbed listener the next Sunday morning .
Felix , Peter and I be all among the chiels who be take mental note on the art of preach a sermon .
Not a motion , or glance , or intonation escape u .
To be sure , none of u could remember the text when we get home ; but we know just how you should throw back your head and clutch the edge of the pulpit with both hand when you announce it .
In the afternoon we all repair to the orchard , Bibles and hymn book in hand .
We do not think it necessary to inform the grown-ups of what be in the wind .
You could never tell what kink a grown-up would take .
They might not think it proper to play any sort of a game on Sunday , not even a Christian game .
Least say be soonest mend where grown-ups be concern .
I mount the pulpit step , feel rather nervous , and my audience sit gravely down on the grass before me .
Our opening exercise consist solely of sing and reading .
We have agree to omit prayer .
Neither Felix , Peter nor I felt equal to pray in public .
But we take up a collection .
The proceeds be to go to mission .
Dan pass the plate -- Felicity 's rosebud plate -- look a preternaturally solemn a Elder Frewen himself .
Every one put a cent on it .
Well , I preach my sermon .
And it fell horribly flat .
I realize that , before I be half way through it .
I think I preach it very well ; and never a thump do I forget or misplace .
But my audience be plainly bore .
When I step down from the pulpit , after demand passionately if we whose soul be light and so forth , I felt with secret humiliation that my sermon be a failure .
It have make no impression at all .
Felix would be sure to get the prize .
`` That be a very good sermon for a first attempt , '' say the Story Girl graciously .
`` It sound just like real sermon I have hear . ''
For a moment the charm of her voice make me feel that I have not do so badly after all ; but the other girl , think it their duty to pay me some sort of a compliment also , quickly dispel that please delusion .
`` Every word of it be true , '' say Cecily , her tone unconsciously imply that this be it sole merit .
`` I often feel , '' say Felicity primly , `` that we do n't think enough about the heathen .
We ought to think a great deal more . ''
Sara Ray put the finishing touch to my mortification .
`` It be so nice and short , '' she say .
`` What be the matter with my sermon ? ''
I ask Dan that night .
Since he be neither judge nor competitor I could discuss the matter with him .
`` It be too much like a reg ` lar sermon to be interesting , '' say Dan frankly .
`` I should think the more like a regular sermon it be , the good , '' I say .
`` Not if you want to make an impression , '' say Dan seriously .
`` You must have something sort of different for that .
Peter , now , HE 'LL have something different . ''
`` Oh , Peter !
I do n't believe he can preach a sermon , '' I say .
`` Maybe not , but you 'll see he 'll make an impression , '' say Dan .
Dan be neither the prophet nor the son of a prophet , but he have the second sight for once ; Peter DID make an impression .
CHAPTER XXVI .
PETER MAKES AN IMPRESSION Peter 's turn come next .
He do not write his sermon out .
That , he aver , be too hard work .
Nor do he mean to take a text .
`` Why , who ever heard of a sermon without a text ? ''
ask Felix blankly .
`` I be go to take a SUBJECT instead of a text , '' say Peter loftily .
`` I ai n't go to tie myself down to a text .
And I 'm go to have head in it -- three head .
You have n't a single head in yours , '' he add to me .
`` Uncle Alec say that Uncle Edward say that head be begin to go out of fashion , '' I say defiantly -- all the more defiantly that I felt I should have have head in my sermon .
It would doubtless have make a much deep impression .
But the truth be I have forget all about such thing .
`` Well , I 'm go to have them , and I do n't care if they be unfashionable , '' say Peter .
`` They 're good thing .
Aunt Jane use to say if a man do n't have head and stick to them he 'd go wander all over the Bible and never get anywhere in particular . ''
`` What be you go to preach on ? ''
ask Felix .
`` You 'll find out next Sunday , '' say Peter significantly .
The next Sunday be in October , and a lovely day it be , warm and bland a June .
There be something in the fine , elusive air , that recall beautiful , forgotten thing and suggest delicate future hope .
The wood have wrap fine-woven gossamer about them and the westering hill be crimson and gold .
We sit around the Pulpit Stone and wait for Peter and Sara Ray .
It be the former 's Sunday off and he have go home the night before , but he assure u he would be back in time to preach his sermon .
Presently he arrive and mount the granite boulder a if to the manor born .
He be dress in his new suit and I , perceive this , felt that he have the advantage of me .
When I preach I have to wear my second best suit , for it be one of Aunt Janet 's law that we should take our good suit off when we come home from church .
There be , I saw , compensation for be a hire boy .
Peter make quite a handsome little minister , in his navy blue coat , white collar , and neatly bow tie .
His black eye shone , and his black curl be brush up in quite a ministerial pompadour , but threaten to tumble over at the top in graceless ringlet .
It be decide that there be no use in wait for Sara Ray , who might or might not come , accord to the humour in which her mother be .
Therefore Peter proceed with the service .
He read the chapter and give out the hymn with as much SANG FROID a if he have be do it all his life .
Mr. Marwood himself could not have better the way in which Peter say , `` We will sing the whole hymn , omit the fourth stanza . ''
That be a fine touch which I have not think of .
I begin to think that , after all , Peter might be a foeman worthy of my steel .
When Peter be ready to begin he thrust his hand into his pocket -- a totally unorthodox thing .
Then he plunge in without further ado , speak in his ordinary conversational tone -- another unorthodox thing .
There be no shorthand reporter present to take that sermon down ; but , if necessary , I could preach it over verbatim , and so , I doubt not , could everyone that hear it .
It be not a forgettable kind of sermon .
`` Dearly beloved , '' say Peter , `` my sermon be about the bad place -- in short , about hell . ''
An electric shock seem to run through the audience .
Everybody look suddenly alert .
Peter have , in one sentence , do what my whole sermon have fail to do .
He have make an impression .
`` I shall divide my sermon into three head , '' pursue Peter .
`` The first head be , what you must not do if you do n't want to go to the bad place .
The second head be , what the bad place be like '' -- sensation in the audience -- `` and the third head be , how to escape go there .
`` Now , there 's a great many thing you must not do , and it 's very important to know what they be .
You ought not to lose no time in find out .
In the first place you must n't ever forget to mind what grown-up people tell you -- that be , GOOD grown-up people . ''
`` But how be you go to tell who be the good grown-up people ? ''
ask Felix suddenly , forget that he be in church .
`` Oh , that be easy , '' say Peter .
`` You can always just FEEL who be good and who be n't .
And you must n't tell lie and you must n't murder any one .
You must be specially careful not to murder any one .
You might be forgive for tell lie , if you be real sorry for them , but if you murder any one it would be pretty hard to get forgiven , so you 'd well be on the safe side .
And you must n't commit suicide , because if you do that you would n't have any chance of repent it ; and you must n't forget to say your prayer and you must n't quarrel with your sister . ''
At this point Felicity give Dan a significant poke with her elbow , and Dan be up in arm at once .
`` Do n't you be preach at me , Peter Craig , '' he cry out .
`` I wo n't stand it .
I do n't quarrel with my sister any oftener than she quarrel with me .
You can just leave me alone . ''
`` Who 's touch you ? ''
demand Peter .
`` I do n't mention no name .
A minister can say anything he like in the pulpit , as long a he do n't mention any name , and nobody can answer back . ''
`` All right , but just you wait till to-morrow , '' growl Dan , subside reluctantly into silence under the reproachful look of the girl .
`` You must not play any game on Sunday , '' go on Peter , `` that be , any week-day game -- or whisper in church , or laugh in church -- I do that once but I be awful sorry -- and you must n't take any notice of Paddy -- I mean of the family cat at family prayer , not even if he climb up on your back .
And you must n't call name or make face . ''
`` Amen , '' cry Felix , who have suffer many thing because Felicity so often make face at him .
Peter stop and glare at him over the edge of the Pulpit Stone .
`` You have n't any business to call out a thing like that right in the middle of a sermon , '' he say .
`` They do it in the Methodist church at Markdale , '' protest Felix , somewhat abash .
`` I hear them . ''
`` I know they do .
That 's the Methodist way and it be all right for them .
I have n't a word to say against Methodists .
My Aunt Jane be one , and I might have be one myself if I have n't be so scared of the Judgment Day .
But you ai n't a Methodist .
You 're a Presbyterian , ai n't you ? ''
`` Yes , of course .
I be bear that way . ''
`` Very well then , you 've get to do thing the Presbyterian way .
Do n't let me hear any more of your amen or I 'll amen you . ''
`` Oh , do n't anybody interrupt again , '' implore the Story Girl .
`` It be n't fair .
How can any one preach a good sermon if he be always be interrupt ?
Nobody interrupt Beverley . ''
`` Bev do n't get up there and pitch into u like that , '' mutter Dan .
`` You must n't fight , '' resume Peter undauntedly .
`` That be , you must n't fight for the fun of fighting , nor out of bad temper .
You must not say bad word or swear .
You must n't get drunk -- although of course you would n't be likely to do that before you grow up , and the girl never .
There 's prob ` ly a good many other thing you must n't do , but these I 've name be the most important .
Of course , I 'm not say you 'll go to the bad place for sure if you do them .
I only say you 're run a risk .
The devil be look out for the people who do these thing and he 'll be more likely to get after them than to waste time over the people who do n't do them .
And that 's all about the first head of my sermon . ''
At this point Sara Ray arrive , somewhat out of breath .
Peter look at her reproachfully .
`` You 've miss my whole first head , Sara , '' he say .
`` that be n't fair , when you 're to be one of the judge .
I think I ought to preach it over again for you . ''
`` That be really do once .
I know a story about it , '' say the Story Girl .
`` Who 's interrupt now ? ''
aid Dan slyly .
`` Never mind , tell u the story , '' say the preacher himself , eagerly lean over the pulpit .
`` It be Mr. Scott who do it , '' say the Story Girl .
`` He be preach somewhere in Nova Scotia , and when he be more than half way through his sermon -- and you know sermon be VERY long in those day -- a man walk in .
Mr. Scott stop until he have take his seat .
Then he say , ` My friend , you be very late for this service .
I hope you wo n't be late for heaven .
The congregation will excuse me if I recapitulate the sermon for our friend 's benefit . '
And then he just preach the sermon over again from the beginning .
It be say that that particular man be never know to be late for church again . ''
`` It serve him right , '' say Dan , `` but it be pretty hard line on the rest of the congregation . ''
`` Now , let 's be quiet so Peter can go on with his sermon , '' say Cecily .
Peter square his shoulder and take hold of the edge of the pulpit .
Never a thump have he thump , but I realize that his way of lean forward and fix this one or that one of his hearer with his eye be much more effective .
`` I 've come now to the second head of my sermon -- what the bad place be like . ''
He proceed to describe the bad place .
Later on we discover that he have find his material in an illustrated translation of Dante 's Inferno which have once be give to his Aunt Jane a a school prize .
But at the time we suppose he must be draw from Biblical source .
Peter have be read the Bible steadily ever since what we always refer to a `` the Judgment Sunday , '' and he be by now almost through it .
None of the rest of u have ever read the Bible completely through , and we think Peter must have find his description of the world of the lose in some portion with which we be not acquaint .
Therefore , his utterance carry all the weight of inspiration , and we sit appal before his lurid phrase .
He use his own word to clothe the idea he have find , and the result be a force and simplicity that strike home to our imagination .
Suddenly Sara Ray sprang to her foot with a scream -- a scream that change into strange laughter .
We all , preacher include , look at her aghast .
Cecily and Felicity spring up and catch hold of her .
Sara Ray be really in a bad fit of hysteric , but we know nothing of such a thing in our experience , and we think she have go mad .
She shriek , cry , laugh , and fling herself about .
`` She 's go clean crazy , '' say Peter , come down out of his pulpit with a very pale face .
`` You 've frighten her crazy with your dreadful sermon , '' say Felicity indignantly .
She and Cecily each take Sara by an arm and , half leading , half carrying , get her out of the orchard and up to the house .
The rest of u look at each other in terrified questioning .
`` You 've make rather too much of an impression , Peter , '' say the Story Girl miserably .
`` She need n't have get so scared .
If she 'd only wait for the third head I 'd have show her how easy it be to get clear of go to the bad place and go to heaven instead .
But you girl be always in such a hurry , '' say Peter bitterly .
`` Do you s ` pose they 'll have to take her to the asylum ? ''
say Dan in a whisper .
`` Hush , here 's your father , '' say Felix .
Uncle Alec come stride down the orchard .
We have never before see Uncle Alec angry .
But there be no doubt that he be very angry .
His blue eye fairly blaze at u a he say , `` What have you be do to frighten Sara Ray into such a condition ? ''
`` We -- we be just have a sermon contest , '' explain the Story Girl tremulously .
`` And Peter preach about the bad place , and it frighten Sara .
That be all , Uncle Alec . ''
`` All !
I do n't know what the result will be to that nervous delicate child .
She be shriek in there and nothing will quiet her .
What do you mean by play such a game on Sunday , and make a jest of sacred thing ?
No , not a word -- '' for the Story Girl have attempt to speak .
`` You and Peter march off home .
And the next time I find you up to such doings on Sunday or any other day I 'll give you cause to remember it to your late hour . ''
The Story Girl and Peter go humbly home and we go with them .
`` I CA N'T understand grown-up people , '' say Felix despairingly .
`` When Uncle Edward preach sermon it be all right , but when we do it it be ` make a jest of sacred thing . '
And I hear Uncle Alec tell a story once about be nearly frighten to death when he be a little boy , by a minister preach on the end of the world ; and he say , ` That be something like a sermon .
You do n't hear such sermon nowadays . '
But when Peter preach just such a sermon , it 's a very different story . ''
`` It 's no wonder we ca n't understand the grown-ups , '' say the Story Girl indignantly , `` because we 've never be grown-up ourselves .
But THEY have be child , and I do n't see why they ca n't understand u .
Of course , perhaps we should n't have have the contest on Sundays .
But all the same I think it 's mean of Uncle Alec to be so cross .
Oh , I do hope poor Sara wo n't have to be take to the asylum . ''
Poor Sara do not have to be .
She be eventually quiet down , and be as well a usual the next day ; and she humbly beg Peter 's pardon for spoil his sermon .
Peter grant it rather grumpily , and I fear that he never really quite forgive Sara for her untimely outburst .
Felix , too , felt resentment against her , because he have lose the chance of preach his sermon .
`` Of course I know I would n't have get the prize , for I could n't have make such an impression a Peter , '' he say to u mournfully , `` but I 'd like to have have a chance to show what I could do .
That 's what come of have those cry-baby girl mix up in thing .
Cecily be just as scared a Sara Ray , but she 'd more sense than to show it like that . ''
`` Well , Sara could n't help it , '' say the Story Girl charitably , `` but it do seem a if we 'd have dreadful luck in everything we 've try lately .
I think of a new game this morning , but I 'm almost afraid to mention it , for I suppose something dreadful will come of it , too . ''
`` Oh , tell u , what be it ? ''
everybody entreat .
`` Well , it 's a trial by ordeal , and we 're to see which of u can pass it .
The ordeal be to eat one of the bitter apple in big mouthful without make a single face . ''
Dan make a face to begin with .
`` I do n't believe any of u can do that , '' he say .
`` YOU ca n't , if you take bite big enough to fill your mouth , '' giggle Felicity , with cruelty and without provocation .
`` Well , maybe you could , '' retort Dan sarcastically .
`` You 'd be so afraid of spoil your look that you 'd rather die than make a face , I s ` pose , no matter what you et . ''
`` Felicity make enough face when there 's nothing to make face at , '' say Felix , who have be grimace at over the breakfast table that morning and have n't like it .
`` I think the bitter apple would be real good for Felix , '' say Felicity .
`` They say sour thing make people thin . ''
`` Let 's go and get the bitter apple , '' say Cecily hastily , see that Felix , Felicity and Dan be on the verge of a quarrel more bitter than the apple .
We go to the seedling tree and get an apple apiece .
The game be that every one must take a bite in turn , chew it up , and swallow it , without make a face .
Peter again distinguish himself .
He , and he alone , pass the ordeal , munch those dreadful mouthful without so much a a change of expression on his countenance , while the facial contortion the rest of u go through baffle description .
In every subsequent trial it be the same .
Peter never make a face , and no one else could help make them .
It send him up fifty per cent in Felicity 's estimation .
`` Peter be a real smart boy , '' she say to me .
`` It 's such a pity he be a hired boy . ''
But , if we could not pass the ordeal , we get any amount of fun out of it , at least .
Evening after even the orchard re-echoed to our peal of laughter .
`` Bless the child , '' say Uncle Alec , a he carry the milk pails across the yard .
`` Nothing can quench their spirit for long . ''
CHAPTER XXVII .
THE ORDEAL OF BITTER APPLES I could never understand why Felix take Peter 's success in the Ordeal of Bitter Apples so much to heart .
He have not felt very keenly over the matter of the sermon , and certainly the mere fact that Peter could eat sour apple without make face do not cast any reflection on the honour or ability of the other competitor .
But to Felix everything suddenly become flat , stale , and unprofitable , because Peter continue to hold the championship of bitter apple .
It haunt his waking hour and obsess his night .
I hear him talk in his sleep about it .
If anything could have make him thin the way he worry over this matter would have do it .
For myself , I care not a groat .
I have wish to be successful in the sermon contest , and felt sore whenever I think of my failure .
But I have no burn desire to eat sour apple without grimacing , and I do not sympathize over and above with my brother .
When , however , he take to pray about it , I realize how deeply he felt on the subject , and hop he would be successful .
Felix pray earnestly that he might be enable to eat a bitter apple without make a face .
And when he have pray three night after this manner , he contrive to eat a bitter apple without a grimace until he come to the last bite , which prove too much for him .
But Felix be vastly encourage .
`` Another prayer or two , and I 'll be able to eat a whole one , '' he say jubilantly .
But this devoutly desire consummation do not come to pass .
In spite of prayer and heroic attempt , Felix could never get beyond that last bite .
Not even faith and work in combination could avail .
For a time he could not understand this .
But he think the mystery be solve when Cecily come to him one day and tell him that Peter be pray against him .
`` He 's pray that you 'll never be able to eat a bitter apple without make a face , '' she say .
`` He tell Felicity and Felicity tell me .
She say she think it be real cute of him .
I think that be a dreadful way to talk about praying and I tell her so .
She want me to promise not to tell you , but I would n't promise , because I think it 's fair for you to know what be go on . ''
Felix be very indignant -- and aggrieve as well .
`` I do n't see why God should answer Peter 's prayer instead of mine , '' he say bitterly .
`` I 've go to church and Sunday School all my life , and Peter never go till this summer .
It be n't fair . ''
`` Oh , Felix , do n't talk like that , '' say Cecily , shock .
`` God MUST be fair .
I 'll tell you what I believe be the reason .
Peter pray three time a day regular -- in the morning and at dinner time and at night -- and besides that , any time through the day when he happen to think of it , he just prays , stand up .
Did you ever hear of such goings-on ? ''
`` Well , he 's get to stop praying against me , anyhow , '' say Felix resolutely .
`` I wo n't put up with it , and I 'll go and tell him so right off . ''
Felix march over to Uncle Roger 's , and we trail after , scent a scene .
We find Peter shell bean in the granary , and whistle cheerily , a with a conscience void of offence towards all men .
`` Look here , Peter , '' say Felix ominously , `` they tell me that you 've be pray right along that I could n't eat a bitter apple .
Now , I tell you -- '' `` I never do ! ''
exclaim Peter indignantly .
`` I never mention your name .
I never pray that you could n't eat a bitter apple .
I just pray that I 'd be the only one that could . ''
`` Well , that 's the same thing , '' cry Felix .
`` You 've just be pray for the opposite to me out of spite .
And you 've get to stop it , Peter Craig . ''
`` Well , I just guess I wo n't , '' say Peter angrily .
`` I 've just as good a right to pray for what I want a you , Felix King , even if you be bring up in Toronto .
I s ` pose you think a hired boy have n't any business to pray for particular thing , but I 'll show you .
I 'll just pray for what I please , and I 'd like to see you try and stop me . ''
`` You 'll have to fight me , if you keep on pray against me , '' say Felix .
The girl gasp ; but Dan and I be jubilant , snuffing battle afar off .
`` All right .
I can fight as well a pray . ''
`` Oh , do n't fight , '' implore Cecily .
`` I think it would be dreadful .
Surely you can arrange it some other way .
Let 's all give up the Ordeal , anyway .
There be n't much fun in it .
And then neither of you need pray about it . ''
`` I do n't want to give up the Ordeal , '' say Felix , `` and I wo n't . ''
`` Oh , well , surely you can settle it some way without fighting , '' persist Cecily .
`` I 'm not want to fight , '' say Peter .
`` It 's Felix .
If he do n't interfere with my prayer there 's no need of fight .
But if he do there 's no other way to settle it . ''
`` But how will that settle it ? ''
ask Cecily .
`` Oh , whoever 's lick will have to give in about the praying , '' say Peter .
`` That 's fair enough .
If I 'm licked I wo n't pray for that particular thing any more . ''
`` It 's dreadful to fight about anything so religious a praying , '' sigh poor Cecily .
`` Why , they be always fight about religion in old time , '' say Felix .
`` The more religious anything be the more fighting there be about it . ''
`` A fellow 's get a right to pray a he please , '' say Peter , `` and if anybody try to stop him he 's bound to fight .
That 's my way of look at it . ''
`` What would Miss Marwood say if she know you be go to fight ? ''
ask Felicity .
Miss Marwood be Felix ' Sunday School teacher and he be very fond of her .
But by this time Felix be quite reckless .
`` I do n't care what she would say , '' he retort .
Felicity try another tack .
`` You 'll be sure to get whipped if you fight with Peter , '' she say .
`` You 're too fat to fight . ''
After that , no moral force on earth could have prevent Felix from fight .
He would have face an army with banner .
`` You might settle it by draw lot , '' say Cecily desperately .
`` Drawing lot be wicked that fighting , '' say Dan .
`` It 's a kind of gambling . ''
`` What would Aunt Jane say if she know you be go to fight ? ''
Cecily demand of Peter .
`` Do n't you drag my Aunt Jane into this affair , '' say Peter darkly .
`` You say you be go to be a Presbyterian , '' persist Cecily .
`` Good Presbyterians do n't fight . ''
`` Oh , do n't they !
I hear your Uncle Roger say that Presbyterians be the best for fight in the world -- or the bad , I forget which he say , but it mean the same thing . ''
Cecily have but one more shot in her locker .
`` I think you say in your sermon , Master Peter , that people should n't fight . ''
`` I say they ought n't to fight for fun , or for bad temper , '' retort Peter .
`` This be different .
I know what I 'm fight for but I ca n't think of the word . ''
`` I guess you mean principle , '' I suggest .
`` Yes , that 's it , '' agree Peter .
`` It 's all right to fight for principle .
It 's kind of pray with your fist . ''
`` Oh , ca n't you do something to prevent them from fight , Sara ? ''
plead Cecily , turn to the Story Girl , who be sit on a bin , swing her shapely bare foot to and fro .
`` It do n't do to meddle in an affair of this kind between boy , '' say the Story Girl sagely .
I may be mistake , but I do not believe the Story Girl want that fight stop .
And I be far from be sure that Felicity do either .
It be ultimately arrange that the combat should take place in the fir wood behind Uncle Roger 's granary .
It be a nice , remote , bosky place where no prowl grown-up would be likely to intrude .
And thither we all resort at sunset .
`` I hope Felix will beat , '' say the Story Girl to me , `` not only for the family honour , but because that be a mean , mean prayer of Peter 's .
Do you think he will ? ''
`` I do n't know , '' I confess dubiously .
`` Felix be too fat .
He 'll get out of breath in no time .
And Peter be such a cool customer , and he 's a year old than Felix .
But then Felix have have some practice .
He have fight boy in Toronto .
And this be Peter 's first fight . ''
`` Did you ever fight ? ''
ask the Story Girl .
`` Once , '' I say briefly , dread the next question , which promptly come .
`` Who beat ? ''
It be sometimes a bitter thing to tell the truth , especially to a young lady for whom you have a great admiration .
I have a struggle with temptation in which I frankly confess I might have be worst have it not be for a saving and timely remembrance of a certain resolution make on the day precede Judgment Sunday .
`` The other fellow , '' I say with reluctant honesty .
`` Well , '' say the Story Girl , `` I think it do n't matter whether you get whip or not so long a you fight a good , square fight . ''
Her potent voice make me feel that I be quite a hero after all , and the sting go out of my recollection of that old fight .
When we arrive behind the granary the others be all there .
Cecily be very pale , and Felix and Peter be take off their coat .
There be a pure yellow sunset that evening , and the aisle of the fir wood be flood with it radiance .
A cool , autumnal wind be whistle among the dark bough and scatter blood red leave from the maple at the end of the granary .
`` Now , '' say Dan , `` I 'll count , and when I say three you pitch in , and hammer each other until one of you have have enough .
Cecily , keep quiet .
Now , one -- two -- three ! ''
Peter and Felix `` pitch in , '' with more zeal than discretion on both side .
As a result , Peter get what later develop into a black eye , and Felix 's nose begin to bleed .
Cecily give a shriek and run out of the wood .
We think she have flee because she could not endure the sight of blood , and we be not sorry , for her manifest disapproval and anxiety be damp the excitement of the occasion .
Felix and Peter draw apart after that first onset , and circle about one another warily .
Then , just a they have come to grip again , Uncle Alec walk around the corner of the granary , with Cecily behind him .
He be not angry .
There be a quizzical look in his eye .
But he take the combatant by their shirt collar and drag them apart .
`` This stop right here , boy , '' he say .
`` You know I do n't allow fight . ''
`` Oh , but Uncle Alec , it be this way , '' begin Felix eagerly .
`` Peter -- '' `` No , I do n't want to hear about it , '' say Uncle Alec sternly .
`` I do n't care what you be fight about , but you must settle your quarrel in a different fashion .
Remember my command , Felix .
Peter , Roger be look for you to wash his buggy .
Be off . ''
Peter go off rather sullenly , and Felix , also sullenly , sit down and begin to nurse his nose .
He turn his back on Cecily .
Cecily `` catch it '' after Uncle Alec have go .
Dan call her a tell-tale and a baby , and sneer at her until Cecily begin to cry .
`` I could n't stand by and watch Felix and Peter pound each other all to piece , '' she sob .
`` They 've be such friend , and it be dreadful to see them fight . ''
`` Uncle Roger would have let them fight it out , '' say the Story Girl discontentedly .
`` Uncle Roger believe in boy fight .
He say it 's a harmless a way a any of work off their original sin .
Peter and Felix would n't have be any bad friend after it .
They 'd have be good friend because the praying question would have be settle .
And now it ca n't be -- unless Felicity can coax Peter to give up pray against Felix . ''
For once in her life the Story Girl be not as tactful a her wont .
Or -- be it possible that she say it out of malice prepense ?
At all event , Felicity resent the imputation that she have more influence with Peter than any one else .
`` I do n't meddle with hired boy ' prayer , '' she say haughtily .
`` It be all nonsense fight about such prayer , anyhow , '' say Dan , who probably think that since all chance of a fight be over , he might as well avow his real sentiment a to it folly .
`` Just as much nonsense a pray about the bitter apple in the first place . ''
`` Oh , Dan , do n't you believe there be some good in pray ? ''
say Cecily reproachfully .
`` Yes , I believe there 's some good in some kind of praying , but not in that kind , '' say Dan sturdily .
`` I do n't believe God care whether anybody can eat an apple without make a face or not . ''
`` I do n't believe it 's right to talk of God a if you be well acquaint with Him , '' say Felicity , who felt that it be a good chance to snub Dan .
`` There 's something wrong somewhere , '' say Cecily perplexedly .
`` We ought to pray for what we want , of that I 'm sure -- and Peter want to be the only one who could pass the Ordeal .
It seem a if he must be right -- and yet it do n't seem so .
I wish I could understand it . ''
`` Peter 's prayer be wrong because it be a selfish prayer , I guess , '' say the Story Girl thoughtfully .
`` Felix 's prayer be all right , because it would n't have hurt any one else ; but it be selfish of Peter to want to be the only one .
We must n't pray selfish prayer . ''
`` Oh , I see through it now , '' say Cecily joyfully .
`` Yes , but , '' say Dan triumphantly , `` if you believe God answer prayer about particular thing , it be Peter 's prayer He answer .
What do you make of that ? ''
`` Oh ! ''
the Story Girl shake her head impatiently .
`` There 's no use try to make such thing out .
We only get more mixed up all the time .
Let 's leave it alone and I 'll tell you a story .
Aunt Olivia have a letter today from a friend in Nova Scotia , who live in Shubenacadie .
When I say I think it a funny name , she tell me to go and look in her scrap book , and I would find a story about the origin of the name .
And I do .
Do n't you want to hear it ? ''
Of course we do .
We all sit down at the root of the fir .
Felix , have finally square matter with his nose , turn around and listen also .
He would not look at Cecily , but every one else have forgive her .
The Story Girl lean that brown head of hers against the fir trunk behind her , and look up at the apple-green sky through the dark bough above u .
She wear , I remember , a dress of warm crimson , and she have wound around her head a string of waxberry , that look like a fillet of pearl .
Her cheek be still flush with the excitement of the evening .
In the dim light she be beautiful , with a wild , mystic loveliness , a compelling charm that would not be deny .
`` Many , many moon ago , an Indian tribe live on the bank of a river in Nova Scotia .
One of the young brave be name Accadee .
He be the tall and brave and handsome young man in the tribe -- '' `` Why be it they 're always so handsome in story ? ''
ask Dan .
`` Why be there never no story about ugly people ? ''
`` Perhaps ugly people never have story happen to them , '' suggest Felicity .
`` I think they 're just as interesting a the handsome people , '' retort Dan .
`` Well , maybe they be in real life , '' say Cecily , `` but in story it 's just as easy to make them handsome a not .
I like them best that way .
I just love to read a story where the heroine be beautiful a a dream . ''
`` Pretty people be always conceited , '' say Felix , who be get tire of hold his tongue .
`` The hero in story be always nice , '' say Felicity , with apparent irrelevance .
`` They 're always so tall and slender .
Would n't it be awful funny if any one write a story about a fat hero -- or about one with too big a mouth ? ''
`` It do n't matter what a man LOOKS like , '' I say , feel that Felix and Dan be catch it rather too hotly .
`` He must be a good sort of chap and DO heap of thing .
That 's all that 's necessary . ''
`` Do any of you happen to want to hear the rest of my story ? ''
ask the Story Girl in an ominously polite voice that recall u to a sense of our bad manner .
We apologize and promise to behave good ; she go on , appease : `` Accadee be all these thing that I have mention , and he be the best hunter in the tribe besides .
Never an arrow of his that do not go straight to the mark .
Many and many a snow white moose he shoot , and give the beautiful skin to his sweetheart .
Her name be Shuben and she be as lovely a the moon when it rise from the sea , and as pleasant a a summer twilight .
Her eye be dark and soft , her foot be as light a a breeze , and her voice sound like a brook in the wood , or the wind that come over the hill at night .
She and Accadee be very much in love with each other , and often they hunt together , for Shuben be almost a skilful with her bow and arrow a Accadee himself .
They have love each other ever since they be small pappoose , and they have vow to love each other as long a the river ran .
`` One twilight , when Accadee be out hunting in the wood , he shoot a snow white moose ; and he take off it skin and wrap it around him .
Then he go on through the wood in the starlight ; and he felt so happy and light of heart that he sometimes frisk and caper about just a a real moose would do .
And he be do this when Shuben , who be also out hunting , saw him from afar and think he be a real moose .
She steal cautiously through the wood until she come to the brink of a little valley .
Below her stand the snow white moose .
She draw her arrow to her eye -- ala , she know the art only too well !
-- and take careful aim .
The next moment Accadee fell dead with her arrow in his heart . ''
The Story Girl pause -- a dramatic pause .
It be quite dark in the fir wood .
We could see her face and eye but dimly through the gloom .
A silvery moon be look down on u over the granary .
The star twinkle through the softly wave bough .
Beyond the wood we catch a glimpse of a moonlit world lie in the sharp frost of the October evening .
The sky above it be chill and ethereal and mystical .
But all about u be shadow ; and the weird little tale , tell in a voice fraught with mystery and pathos , have people them for u with furtive folk in belt and wampum , and dark-tressed Indian maiden .
`` What do Shuben do when she find out she have kill Accadee ? ''
ask Felicity .
`` She die of a broken heart before the spring , and she and Accadee be bury side by side on the bank of the river which have ever since bear their name -- the river Shubenacadie , '' say the Story Girl .
The sharp wind blew around the granary and Cecily shiver .
We hear Aunt Janet 's voice call `` Children , child . ''
Shaking off the spell of fir and moonlight and romantic tale , we scramble to our foot and go homeward .
`` I kind of wish I 'd be bear an Injun , '' say Dan .
`` It must have be a jolly life -- nothing to do but hunt and fight . ''
`` It would n't be so nice if they catch you and torture you at the stake , '' say Felicity .
`` No , '' say Dan reluctantly .
`` I suppose there 'd be some drawback to everything , even be an Injun . ''
`` Is n't it cold ? ''
say Cecily , shiver again .
`` It will soon be winter .
I wish summer could last forever .
Felicity like the winter , and so do the Story Girl , but I do n't .
It always seem so long till spring . ''
`` Never mind , we 've have a splendid summer , '' I say , slip my arm about her to comfort some childish sorrow that breathe in her plaintive voice .
Truly , we have have a delectable summer ; and , have have it , it be ours forever .
`` The god themselves can not recall their gift . ''
They may rob u of our future and embitter our present , but our past they may not touch .
With all it laughter and delight and glamour it be our eternal possession .
Nevertheless , we all felt a little of the sadness of the waning year .
There be a distinct weight on our spirit until Felicity take u into the pantry and stay u with apple tart and comfort u with cream .
Then we brighten up .
It be really a very decent world after all .
CHAPTER XXVIII .
THE TALE OF THE RAINBOW BRIDGE Felix , so far a my remembrance go , never attain to success in the Ordeal of Bitter Apples .
He give up try after awhile ; and he also give up pray about it , say in bitterness of spirit that there be no use in pray when other fellow pray against you out of spite .
He and Peter remain on bad term for some time , however .
We be all of u too tire those night to do any special praying .
Sometimes I fear our `` regular '' prayer be slur over , or mumble in anything but reverent haste .
October be a busy month on the hill farm .
The apple have to be pick , and this work fell mainly to u child .
We stay home from school to do it .
It be pleasant work and there be a great deal of fun in it ; but it be hard , too , and our arm and back ache roundly at night .
In the morning it be very delightful ; in the afternoon tolerable ; but in the evening we lag , and the laughter and zest of fresher hour be lack .
Some of the apple have to be pick very carefully .
But with others it do not matter ; we boy would climb the tree and shake the apple down until the girl shriek for mercy .
The day be crisp and mellow , with warm sunshine and a tang of frost in the air , mingle with the woodsy odour of the withering grass .
The hen and turkey prowl about , peck at windfall , and Pat make mad rush at them amid the fallen leave .
The world beyond the orchard be in a royal magnificence of colour , under the vivid blue autumn sky .
The big willow by the gate be a splendid golden dome , and the maple that be scatter through the spruce grove wave blood-red banner over the sombre cone-bearers .
The Story Girl generally have her head garland with their leaf .
They become her vastly .
Neither Felicity nor Cecily could have wear them .
Those two girl be of a domestic type that assort ill with the wildfire in Nature 's vein .
But when the Story Girl wreathe her nut brown tress with crimson leave it seem , a Peter say , that they grow on her -- a if the gold and flame of her spirit have break out in a coronal , a much a part of her a the pale halo seem a part of the Madonna it encircle .
What tales she tell u on those far-away autumn day , people the russet arcade with folk of an elder world .
Many a princess rode by u on her palfrey , many a swagger gallant ruffle it bravely in velvet and plume adown Uncle Stephen 's Walk , many a stately lady , silken clad , walk in that opulent orchard !
When we have fill our basket they have to be carry to the granary loft , and the content store in bin or spread on the floor to ripen far .
We eat a good many , of course , feel that the labourer be worthy of his hire .
The apple from our own birthday tree be store in separate barrel inscribe with our name .
We might dispose of them a we will .
Felicity sell hers to Uncle Alec 's hired man -- and be badly cheat to boot , for he levant shortly afterwards , take the apple with him , have pay her only half her rightful due .
Felicity have not get over that to this day .
Cecily , dear heart , send most of hers to the hospital in town , and no doubt gather in therefrom dividend of gratitude and satisfaction of soul , such a can never be purchase by any mere process of bargain and sale .
The rest of u eat our apple , or carry them to school where we barter them for such treasure a our schoolmate possess and we covet .
There be a dusky , little , pear-shaped apple -- from one of Uncle Stephen 's tree -- which be our favourite ; and next to it a delicious , juicy yellow apple from Aunt Louisa 's tree .
We be also fond of the big sweet apple ; we use to throw them up in the air and let them fall on the ground until they be bruise and batter to the bursting point .
Then we suck on the juice ; sweeter be it than the nectar drunk by blissful god on the Thessalian hill .
Sometimes we work until the cold yellow sunset fade out over the darkening distance , and the hunter 's moon look down on u through the sparkling air .
The constellation of autumn scintillate above u .
Peter and the Story Girl know all about them , and impart their knowledge to u generously .
I recall Peter stand on the Pulpit Stone , one night ere moonrise , and point them out to u , occasionally have a difference of opinion with the Story Girl over the name of some particular star .
Job 's Coffin and the Northern Cross be to the west of u ; south of u flame Fomalhaut .
The Great Square of Pegasus be over our head .
Cassiopeia sit enthrone in her beautiful chair in the north-east ; and north of u the Dippers swung untiringly around the Pole Star .
Cecily and Felix be the only one who could distinguish the double star in the handle of the Big Dipper , and greatly do they plume themselves thereon .
The Story Girl tell u the myth and legend weave around these immemorial cluster , her very voice take on a clear , remote , starry sound a she talk of them .
When she cease , we come back to earth , feeling a if we have be million of mile away in the blue ether , and that all our old familiar surroundings be momentarily forget and strange .
That night when he point out the star to u from the Pulpit Stone be the last time for several week that Peter share our toil and pastime .
The next day he complain of headache and sore throat , and seem to prefer lie on Aunt Olivia 's kitchen sofa to do any work .
As it be not in Peter to be a malingerer he be leave in peace , while we pick apple .
Felix alone , must unjustly and spitefully , declare that Peter be simply shirk .
`` He 's just lazy , that 's what 's the matter with him , '' he say .
`` Why do n't you talk sense , if you must talk ? ''
say Felicity .
`` There 's no sense in call Peter lazy .
You might as well say I have black hair .
Of course , Peter , be a Craig , have his fault , but he 's a smart boy .
His father be lazy but his mother have n't a lazy bone in her body , and Peter take after her . ''
`` Uncle Roger say Peter 's father be n't exactly lazy , '' say the Story Girl .
`` The trouble be , there be so many other thing he like good than work . ''
`` I wonder if he 'll ever come back to his family , '' say Cecily .
`` Just think how dreadful it would be if OUR father have leave u like that ! ''
`` Our father be a King , '' say Felicity loftily , `` and Peter 's father be only a Craig .
A member of our family COULD N'T behave like that . ''
`` They say there must be a black sheep in every family , '' say the Story Girl .
`` There be n't any in ours , '' say Cecily loyally .
`` Why do white sheep eat more than black ? ''
ask Felix .
`` Is that a conundrum ? ''
ask Cecily cautiously .
`` If it be I wo n't try to guess the reason .
I never can guess conundrum . ''
`` It be n't a conundrum , '' say Felix .
`` It 's a fact .
They do -- and there 's a good reason for it . ''
We stop pick apple , sit down on the grass , and try to reason it out -- with the exception of Dan , who declare that he know there be a catch somewhere and he be n't go to be catch .
The rest of u could not see where any catch could exist , since Felix solemnly vow , ` cross his heart , white sheep do eat more than black .
We argue over it seriously , but finally have to give it up .
`` Well , what be the reason ? ''
ask Felicity .
`` Because there 's more of them , '' say Felix , grinning .
I forget what we do to Felix .
A shower come up in the evening and we have to stop picking .
After the shower there be a magnificent double rainbow .
We watch it from the granary window , and the Story Girl tell u an old legend , cull from one of Aunt Olivia 's many scrapbook .
`` Long , long ago , in the Golden Age , when the god use to visit the earth so often that it be nothing uncommon to see them , Odin make a pilgrimage over the world .
Odin be the great god of the northland , you know .
And wherever he go among men he teach them love and brotherhood , and skilful art ; and great city spring up where he have tread , and every land through which he pass be bless because one of the god have come down to men .
But many men and woman follow Odin himself , give up all their worldly possession and ambition ; and to these he promise the gift of eternal life .
All these people be good and noble and unselfish and kind ; but the best and noble of them all be a youth name Ving ; and this youth be beloved by Odin above all others , for his beauty and strength and goodness .
Always he walk on Odin 's right hand , and always the first light of Odin 's smile fell on him .
Tall and straight be he a a young pine , and his long hair be the colour of ripe wheat in the sun ; and his blue eye be like the northland heavens on a starry night .
`` In Odin 's band be a beautiful maiden name Alin .
She be a fair and delicate a a young birch tree in spring among the dark old pine and fir , and Ving love her with all his heart .
His soul thrill with rapture at the thought that he and she together should drink from the fountain of immortality , a Odin have promise , and be one thereafter in eternal youth .
`` At last they come to the very place where the rainbow touch the earth .
And the rainbow be a great bridge , built of living colour , so dazzling and wonderful that beyond it the eye could see nothing , only far away a great , blinding , sparkle glory , where the fountain of life sprang up in a shower of diamond fire .
But under the Rainbow Bridge roll a terrible flood , deep and wide and violent , full of rock and rapid and whirlpool .
`` There be a Warder of the bridge , a god , dark and stern and sorrowful .
And to him Odin give command that he should open the gate and allow his follower to cross the Rainbow Bridge , that they might drink of the fountain of life beyond .
And the Warder set open the gate . ''
` Pass on and drink of the fountain , ' he say .
` To all who taste of it shall immortality be give .
But only to that one who shall drink of it first shall be permit to walk at Odin 's right hand forever . '
`` Then the company pass through in great haste , all fire with a desire to be the first to drink of the fountain and win so marvellous a boon .
Last of all come Ving .
He have linger behind to pluck a thorn from the foot of a beggar child he have meet on the highway , and he have not hear the Warder 's word .
But when , eager , joyous , radiant , he set his foot on the rainbow , the stern , sorrowful Warder take him by the arm and draw him back . ''
` Ving , strong , noble , and valiant , ' he say , ` Rainbow Bridge be not for thee . '
`` Very dark grow Ving 's face .
Hot rebellion rise in his heart and rush over his pale lip . ''
` Why dost thou keep back the draught of immortality from me ? '
he demand passionately .
`` The Warder point to the dark flood that roll under the bridge . ''
` The path of the rainbow be not for thee , ' he say , ` but yonder way be open .
Ford that flood .
On the furthest bank be the fountain of life . ' ''
` Thou mock me , ' mutter Ving sullenly .
` No mortal could cross that flood .
Oh , Master , ' he pray , turn beseechingly to Odin , ` thou didst promise to me eternal life a to the others .
Wilt thou not keep that promise ?
Command the Warder to let me pass .
He must obey thee . '
`` But Odin stand silent , with his face turn from his beloved , and Ving 's heart be fill with unspeakable bitterness and despair . ''
` Thou mayest return to earth if thou fearest to essay the flood , ' say the Warder . ''
` Nay , ' say Ving wildly , ` earthly life without Alin be more dreadful than the death which await me in yon dark river . '
`` And he plunge fiercely in .
He swim , and struggle , he buffetted the turmoil .
The wave go over his head again and again , the whirlpool catch him and fling him on the cruel rock .
The wild , cold spray beat on his eye and blind him , so that he could see nothing , and the roar of the river deafen him so that he could hear nothing ; but he felt keenly the wound and bruise of the cruel rock , and many a time he would have give up the struggle have not the thought of sweet Alin 's love eye bring him the strength and desire to struggle as long a it be possible .
Long , long , long , to him seem that bitter and perilous passage ; but at last he win through to the furthest side .
Breathless and reeling , his vesture torn , his great wound bleeding , he find himself on the shore where the fountain of immortality sprang up .
He stagger to it brink and drank of it clear stream .
Then all pain and weariness fell away from him , and he rise up , a god , beautiful with immortality .
And a he do there come rush over the Rainbow Bridge a great company -- the band of fellow traveller .
But all be too late to win the double boon .
Ving have win to it through the danger and suffering of the dark river . ''
The rainbow have fade out , and the darkness of the October dusk be fall .
`` I wonder , '' say Dan meditatively , a we go away from that redolent spot , `` what it would be like to live for ever in this world . ''
`` I expect we 'd get tire of it after awhile , '' say the Story Girl .
`` But , '' she add , `` I think it would be a goodly while before I would . ''
CHAPTER XXIX .
THE SHADOW FEARED OF MAN We be all up early the next morning , dress by candlelight .
But early a it be we find the Story Girl in the kitchen when we go down , sit on Rachel Ward 's blue chest and look important .
`` What do you think ? ''
she exclaim .
`` Peter have the measles !
He be dreadfully sick all night , and Uncle Roger have to go for the doctor .
He be quite light-headed , and do n't know any one .
Of course he 's far too sick to be take home , so his mother have come up to wait on him , and I 'm to live over here until he be well . ''
This be mingle bitter and sweet .
We be sorry to hear that Peter have the measles ; but it would be jolly to have the Story Girl live with u all the time .
What orgies of story tell we should have !
`` I suppose we 'll all have the measles now , '' grumble Felicity .
`` And October be such an inconvenient time for measles -- there 's so much to do . ''
`` I do n't believe any time be very convenient to have the measles , '' Cecily say .
`` Oh , perhaps we wo n't have them , '' say the Story Girl cheerfully .
`` Peter catch them at Markdale , the last time he be home , his mother say . ''
`` I do n't want to catch the measles from Peter , '' say Felicity decidedly .
`` Fancy catch them from a hired boy ! ''
`` Oh , Felicity , do n't call Peter a hired boy when he 's sick , '' protest Cecily .
During the next two day we be very busy -- too busy to tell tale or listen to them .
Only in the frosty dusk do we have time to wander afar in realm of gold with the Story Girl .
She have recently be dig into a couple of old volume of classic myth and northland folklore which she have find in Aunt Olivia 's attic ; and for u , god and goddess , laugh nymph and mocking satyr , norn and valkyrie , elf and troll , and `` green folk '' generally , be real creature once again , inhabit the orchard and wood and meadow around u , until it seem a if the Golden Age have return to earth .
Then , on the third day , the Story Girl come to u with a very white face .
She have be over to Uncle Roger 's yard to hear the late bulletin from the sick room .
Hitherto they have be of a non-committal nature ; but now it be only too evident that she have bad news .
`` Peter be very , very sick , '' she say miserably .
`` He have catch cold someway -- and the measles have strike in -- and -- and -- '' the Story Girl wring her brown hand together -- `` the doctor be afraid he -- he -- wo n't get good . ''
We all stand around , stricken , incredulous .
`` Do you mean , '' say Felix , find voice at length , `` that Peter be go to die ? ''
The Story Girl nod miserably .
`` They 're afraid so . ''
Cecily sit down by her half fill basket and begin to cry .
Felicity say violently that she do n't believe it .
`` I ca n't pick another apple to-day and I ai n't go to try , '' say Dan .
None of u could .
We go to the grown-ups and tell them so ; and the grown-ups , with unaccustomed understanding and sympathy , tell u that we need not .
Then we roam about in our wretchedness and try to comfort one another .
We avoid the orchard ; it be for u too full of happy memory to accord with our bitterness of soul .
Instead , we resort to the spruce wood , where the hush and the sombre shadow and the soft , melancholy sighing of the wind in the branch over u do not jar harshly on our new sorrow .
We could not really believe that Peter be go to die -- to DIE .
Old people die .
Grown-up people die .
Even child of whom we have hear die .
But that one of US -- of our merry little band -- should die be unbelievable .
We could not believe it .
And yet the possibility strike u in the face like a blow .
We sit on the mossy stone under the dark old evergreen and give ourselves up to wretchedness .
We all , even Dan , cry , except the Story Girl .
`` I do n't see how you can be so unfeeling , Sara Stanley , '' say Felicity reproachfully .
`` You 've always be such friend with Peter -- and make out you think so much of him -- and now you ai n't shed a tear for him . ''
I look at the Story Girl 's dry , piteous eye , and suddenly remember that I have never see her cry .
When she tell u sad tale , in a voice laden with all the tear that have ever be shed , she have never shed one of her own .
`` I ca n't cry , '' she say drearily .
`` I wish I could .
I 've a dreadful feeling here -- '' she touch her slender throat -- `` and if I could cry I think it would make it good .
But I ca n't . ''
`` Maybe Peter will get good after all , '' say Dan , swallow a sob .
`` I 've hear of lot of people who go and get well after the doctor say they be go to die . ''
`` While there 's life there 's hope , you know , '' say Felix .
`` We should n't cross bridge till we come to them . ''
`` Those be only proverbs , '' say the Story Girl bitterly .
`` Proverbs be all very fine when there 's nothing to worry you , but when you 're in real trouble they 're not a bit of help . ''
`` Oh , I wish I 'd never say Peter be n't fit to associate with , '' moan Felicity .
`` If he ever get well I 'll never say such a thing again -- I 'll never THINK it .
He 's just a lovely boy and twice as smart a lot that be n't hire out . ''
`` He be always so polite and good-natured and obliging , '' sigh Cecily .
`` He be just a real gentleman , '' say the Story Girl .
`` There ai n't many fellow a fair and square a Peter , '' say Dan .
`` And such a worker , '' say Felix .
`` Uncle Roger say he never have a boy he could depend on like Peter , '' I say .
`` It 's too late to be say all these nice thing about him now , '' say the Story Girl .
`` He wo n't ever know how much we think of him .
It 's too late . ''
`` If he get good I 'll tell him , '' say Cecily resolutely .
`` I wish I have n't box his ear that day he try to kiss me , '' go on Felicity , who be evidently rake her conscience for past offence in regard to Peter .
`` Of course I could n't be expect to let a hir -- to let a boy kiss me .
But I need n't have be so cross about it .
I might have be more dignified .
And I tell him I just hat him .
That be n't true , but I s ` pose he 'll die think it be .
Oh , dear me , what make people say thing they 've get to be so sorry for afterwards ? ''
`` I suppose if Peter d-d-dies he 'll go to heaven anyhow , '' sob Cecily .
`` He 's be real good all this summer , but he be n't a church member . ''
`` He 's a Presbyterian , you know , '' say Felicity reassuringly .
Her tone express her conviction that that would carry Peter through if anything would .
`` We 're none of u church member .
But of course Peter could n't be send to the bad place .
That would be ridiculous .
What would they do with him there , when he 's so good and polite and honest and kind ? ''
`` Oh , I think he 'll be all right , too , '' sigh Cecily , `` but you know he never do go to church and Sunday School before this summer . ''
`` Well , his father run away , and his mother be too busy earn a living to bring him up right , '' argue Felicity .
`` Do n't you suppose that anybody , even God , would make allowance for that ? ''
`` Of course Peter will go to heaven , '' say the Story Girl .
`` He 's not grow up enough to go anywhere else .
Children always go to heaven .
But I do n't want him to go there or anywhere else .
I want him to stay right here .
I know heaven must be a splendid place , but I 'm sure Peter would rather be here , have fun with u . ''
`` Sara Stanley , '' rebuke Felicity .
`` I should think you would n't say such thing at such a solemn time .
You 're such a queer girl . ''
`` Would n't you rather be here yourself than in heaven ? ''
say the Story Girl bluntly .
`` Would n't you now , Felicity King ?
Tell the truth , ` cross your heart . ''
But Felicity take refuge from this inconvenient question in tear .
`` If we could only DO something to help Peter ! ''
I say desperately .
`` It seem dreadful not to be able to do a single thing . ''
`` There 's one thing we can do , '' say Cecily gently .
`` We can pray for him . ''
`` So we can , '' I agree .
`` I 'm go to pray like sixty , '' say Felix energetically .
`` We 'll have to be awful good , you know , '' warn Cecily .
`` There 's no use pray if you 're not good . ''
`` That will be easy , '' sigh Felicity .
`` I do n't feel a bit like be bad .
If anything happen to Peter I feel sure I 'll never be naughty again .
I wo n't have the heart . ''
We do , indeed , pray most sincerely for Peter 's recovery .
We do not , a in the case of Paddy , `` tack it on after more important thing , '' but put it in the very forefront of our petition .
Even skeptical Dan prayed , his skepticism fall away from him like a discarded garment in this valley of the shadow , which sift out heart and try souls , until we all , grown-up or child , realize our weakness , and , find that our own puny strength be a a reed shake in the wind , creep back humbly to the God we have vainly dream we could do without .
Peter be no good the next day .
Aunt Olivia report that his mother be broken-hearted .
We do not again ask to be release from work .
Instead , we go at it with feverish zeal .
If we work hard there be less time for grief and grievious thought .
We pick apple and drag them to the granary doggedly .
In the afternoon Aunt Janet bring u a lunch of apple turnover ; but we could not eat them .
Peter , a Felicity remind u with a burst of tear , have be so fond of apple turnover .
And , oh , how good we be !
How angelically and unnaturally good !
Never be there such a band of kind , sweet-tempered , unselfish child in any orchard .
Even Felicity and Dan , for once in their life , get through the day without any exchange of left-handed compliment .
Cecily confide to me that she never mean to put her hair up in curler on Saturday night again , because it be pretend .
She be so anxious to repent of something , sweet girl , and this be all she could think of .
During the afternoon Judy Pineau bring up a tear-blotted note from Sara Ray .
Sara have not be allow to visit the hill farm since Peter have develop measles .
She be an unhappy little exile , and could only relieve her anguish of soul by daily letter to Cecily , which the faithful and oblige Judy Pineau bring up for her .
These epistle be a gushingly underline a if Sara have be a correspondent of early Victorian day .
Cecily do not write back , because Mrs. Ray have decree that no letter must be take down from the hill farm l they carry infection .
Cecily have offer to bake every epistle thoroughly in the oven before send it ; but Mrs. Ray be inexorable , and Cecily have to content herself by send long verbal message with Judy Pineau .
`` My OWN DEAREST Cecily , '' run Sara 's letter .
`` I have just hear the sad news about POOR DEAR PETER .
I ca n't describe MY FEELINGS .
They be DREADFUL .
I have be cry ALL THE AFTERNOON .
I wish I could FLY to you , but ma will not let me .
She be afraid I will catch the measles , but I would rather have the measles A DOZEN TIMES OVER than be sepparated from you all like this .
But I have felt , ever since the Judgment Sunday that I MUST OBEY MA BETTER than I use to do .
If ANYTHING HAPPENS to Peter and you be let see him BEFORE IT HAPPENS give him MY LOVE and tell him HOW SORRY I AM , and that I hope we will ALL meet in A BETTER WORLD Everything in school be about the same .
The master be awful cross by spell .
Jimmy Frewen walk home with Nellie Bowan last night from prayer-meeting and HER ONLY FOURTEEN .
Do n't you think it horrid BEGINNING SO YOUNG ?
YOU AND ME would NEVER do anything like that till we be GROWN UP , would we ?
Willy Fraser look SO LONESOME in school these day .
I must stop for ma say I waste FAR TOO MUCH TIME write letter .
Tell Judy ALL THE NEWS for me .
`` Your OWN TRUE FRIEND , `` SARA RAY .
`` P.S . Oh I DO hope Peter will get good .
Ma be go to get me a new brown dress for the winter .
`` S. R. '' When even come we go to our seat under the whispering , sigh fir tree .
It be a beautiful night -- clear , windless , frosty .
Some one gallop down the road on horseback , lustily sing a comic song .
How dare he ?
We felt that it be an insult to our wretchedness .
If Peter be go to -- go to -- well , if anything happen to Peter , we felt so miserably sure that the music of life would be still for u for ever .
How could any one in the world be happy when we be so unhappy ?
Presently Aunt Olivia come down the long twilight arcade .
Her bright hair be uncover and she look slim and queen-like in her light dress .
We think Aunt Olivia very pretty then .
Looking back from a mature standpoint I realize that she must have be an unusually beautiful woman ; and she look her prettiest a she stand under the sway bough in the last faint light of the autumn dusk and smile down at our woebegone face .
`` Dear , sorrowful little people , I bring you glad tidings of great joy , '' she say .
`` The doctor have just be here , and he find Peter much good , and think he will pull through after all . ''
We gaze up at her in silence for a few moment .
When we have hear the news of Paddy 's recovery we have be noisy and jubilant ; but we be very quiet now .
We have be too near something dark and terrible and menacing ; and though it be thus suddenly remove the chill and shadow of it be about u still .
Presently the Story Girl , who have be stand up , lean against a tall fir , slip down to the ground in a huddled fashion and break into a very passion of weep .
I have never hear any one cry so , with dreadful , rend sob .
I be use to hear girl cry .
It be as much Sara Ray 's normal state a any other , and even Felicity and Cecily avail themselves occasionally of the privilege of sex .
But I have never hear any girl cry like this .
It give me the same unpleasant sensation which I have felt one time when I have see my father cry .
`` Oh , do n't , Sara , do n't , '' I say gently , pat her convulsed shoulder .
`` You ARE a queer girl , '' say Felicity -- more tolerantly than usual however -- `` you never cry a speck when you think Peter be go to die -- and now when he be go to get good you cry like that . ''
`` Sara , child , come with me , '' say Aunt Olivia , bend over her .
The Story Girl get up and go away , with Aunt Olivia 's arm around her .
The sound of her cry die away under the fir , and with it seem to go the dread and grief that have be our portion for hour .
In the reaction our spirit rise with a bound .
`` Oh , ai n't it great that Peter 's go to be all right ? ''
say Dan , spring up .
`` I never be so glad of anything in my whole life , '' declare Felicity in shameless rapture .
`` Ca n't we send word somehow to Sara Ray to-night ? ''
ask Cecily , the ever-thoughtful .
`` She 's feel so bad -- and she 'll have to feel that way till to-morrow if we ca n't . ''
`` Let 's all go down to the Ray gate and holler to Judy Pineau till she come out , '' suggest Felix .
Accordingly , we go and `` holler , '' with a right good will .
We be much take aback to find that Mrs. Ray come to the gate instead of Judy , and rather sourly demand what we be yell about .
When she hear our news , however , she have the decency to say she be glad , and to promise she would convey the good tidings to Sara -- `` who be already in bed , where all child of her age should be , '' add Mrs. Ray severely .
WE have no intention of go to bed for a good two hour yet .
Instead , after devoutly thank goodness that our grown-ups , in spite of some imperfection , be not of the Mrs. Ray type , we betook ourselves to the granary , light a huge lantern which Dan have make out of a turnip , and proceed to devour all the apple we might have eat through the day but have not .
We be a blithe little crew , sit there in the light of our goblin lantern .
We have in very truth be give beauty for ash and the oil of joy for mourn .
Life be a a red rise once more .
`` I 'm go to make a big batch of patty-pan , first thing in the morning , '' say Felicity jubilantly .
`` Is n't it queer ?
Last night I felt just like pray , and tonight I feel just like cook . ''
`` We must n't forget to thank God for make Peter better , '' say Cecily , a we finally go to the house .
`` Do you s ` pose Peter would n't have get well anyway ? ''
say Dan .
`` Oh , Dan , what make you ask such question ? ''
exclaim Cecily in real distress .
`` I dunno , '' say Dan .
`` They just kind of come into my head , like .
But of course I mean to thank God when I say my prayer to-night .
That 's only decent . ''
CHAPTER XXX .
A COMPOUND LETTER Once Peter be out of danger he recover rapidly , but he find his convalescence rather tedious ; and Aunt Olivia suggest to u one day that we write a `` compound letter '' to amuse him , until he could come to the window and talk to u from a safe distance .
The idea appeal to u ; and , the day be Saturday and the apple all pick , we betook ourselves to the orchard to compose our epistle , Cecily have first send word by a convenient caller to Sara Ray , that she , too , might have a letter ready .
Later , I , have at that time a mania for preserve all document relate to our life in Carlisle , copy those letter in the blank page at the back of my dream book .
Hence I can reproduce them verbatim , with the bouquet they have retain through all the long year since they be pen in that autumnal orchard on the hill , with it fading leaf and frosted grass , and the `` mild , delightsome melancholy '' of the late October day enfold .
CECILY 'S LETTER `` DEAR PETER : -- I be so very glad and thankful that you be go to get good .
We be so afraid you would not last Tuesday , and we felt dreadful , even Felicity .
We all pray for you .
I think the others have stop now , but I keep it up every night still , for fear you might have a relaps .
-LRB- I do n't know if that be spell right .
I have n't the dixonary handy , and if I ask the others Felicity will laugh at me , though she can not spell lot of word herself . -RRB-
I be save some of the Honourable Mr. Whalen 's pear for you .
I 've get them hide where nobody can find them .
There 's only a dozen because Dan et all the rest , but I guess you will like them .
We have get all the apple pick , and be all ready to take the measles now , if we have to , but I hope we wo n't .
If we have to , though , I 'd rather catch them from you than from any one else , because we be acquaint with you .
If I do take the measles and anything happen to me Felicity be to have my cherry vase .
I 'd rather give it to the Story Girl , but Dan say it ought to be keep in the family , even if Felicity be a crank .
I have n't anything else valuable , since I give Sara Ray my forget-me-not jug , but if you would like anything I 've get let me know and I 'll leave instruction for you to have it .
The Story Girl have tell u some splendid story lately .
I wish I be clever like her .
Ma say it do n't matter if you 're not clever as long a you be good , but I be not even very good .
`` I think this be all my news , except that I want to tell you how much we all think of you , Peter .
When we hear you be sick we all say nice thing about you , but we be afraid it be too late , and I say if you get good I 'd tell you .
It be easy to write it than to tell it out to your face .
We think you be smart and polite and oblige and a great worker and a gentleman .
`` Your true friend , `` CECILY KING .
`` P.S . .
If you answer my letter do n't say anything about the pear , because I do n't want Dan to find out there 's any left .
C. K. '' FELICITY 'S LETTER `` DEAR PETER : -- Aunt Olivia say for u all to write a compound letter to cheer you up .
We be all awful glad you be get well .
It give u an awful scare when we hear you be go to die .
But you will soon be all right and able to get out again .

I be go to bake some nice thing for you and send them over , now that the doctor say you can eat them .
And I 'll send you my rosebud plate to eat off of .
I 'm only lend it , you know , not give it .
I let very few people use it because it be my great treasure .
Mind you do n't break it .
Aunt Olivia must always wash it , not your mother .
`` I do hope the rest of u wo n't catch the measles .
It must look horrid to have red spot all over your face .
We all feel pretty well yet .
The Story Girl say a many queer thing a ever .
Felix think he be get thin , but he be fatter than ever , and no wonder , with all the apple he eat .
He have give up try to eat the bitter apple at last .
Beverley have grow half an inch since July , by the mark on the hall door , and he be awful pleased about it .
I tell him I guess the magic seed be take effect at last , and he get mad .
He never get mad at anything the Story Girl say , and yet she be so sarkastic by time .
Dan be pretty hard to get along with a usul , but I try to bear pashently with him .
Cecily be well and say she be n't go to curl her hair any more .
She be so conscienshus .
I be glad my hair curl of itself , ai n't you ?
`` We have n't see Sara Ray since you get sick .
She be awful lonesome , and Judy say she cry nearly all the time but that be nothing new .
I 'm awful sorry for Sara but I 'm glad I 'm not her .
She be go to write you a letter too .
You 'll let me see what she put in it , wo n't you ?
You 'd better take some Mexican Tea now .

`` I be go to get a lovely dark blue dress for the winter .
It be ever so much pretty than Sara Ray 's brown one .
Sara Ray 's mother have no taste .
The Story Girl 's father be send her a new red dress , and a red velvet cap from Paris .
She be so fond of red .
I ca n't bear it , it look so common .
Mother say I can get a velvet hood too .
Cecily say she do n't believe it 's right to wear velvet when it 's so expensive and the heathen be cry for the gospel .
She get that idea from a Sunday School paper but I be go to get my hood all the same .
`` Well , Peter , I have no more news so I will close for this time .
`` hop you will soon be quite well , I remain `` yours sincerely , `` FELICITY KING .
`` P.S . .
The Story Girl peek over my shoulder and say I ought to have sign it ` yours affeckshunately , ' but I know well , because the Family Guide have tell lot of time how you should sign yourself when you be write to a young man who be only a friend .
F. K. '' FELIX ' LETTER `` DEAR PETER : -- I be awful glad you be get well .
We all felt bad when we think you would n't , but I felt bad than the others because we have n't be on very good term lately and I have say mean thing about you .
I 'm sorry and , Peter , you can pray for anything you like and I wo n't ever object again .
I 'm glad Uncle Alec interfere and stop the fight .
If I have lick you and you have die of the measles it would have be a dreadful thing .
`` We have all the apple in and have n't much to do just now and we be have lot of fun but we wish you be here to join in .

I guess work so hard picking apple be a good thing to make you thin .
The girl be all well .
Felicity put on a many air a ever , but she make great thing to eat .
I have have some splendid dream since we give up write them down .
That be always the way .
We ai n't go to school till we 're sure we be not go to have the measles .
This be all I can think of , so I will draw to a close .
Remember , you can pray for anything you like .
FELIX KING . ''
SARA RAY 'S LETTER `` DEAR PETER : -- I never write to A BOY before , so PLEASE excuse ALL mistake .
I be SO glad you be get well .
We be SO afraid you be GOING TO DIE .
I CRIED ALL NIGHT about it .
But now that you be OUT OF DANGER will you tell me WHAT IT REALLY FEELS LIKE to think you be go to die ?
Does it FEEL QUEER ?
Were you VERY badly frighten ?
`` Ma wo n't let me go up the hill AT ALL now .
I would DIE if it be not for Judy Pinno .
-LRB- The French name be SO HARD TO SPELL . -RRB-
JUDY IS VERY OBLIGING and I feel that she SIMPATHISES WITH ME .
In my LONELY HOURS I read my dream book and Cecily 's old letter and they be SUCH A COMFORT to me .
I have be read one of the school library book too .
I be PRETTY GOOD but I wish they have get more LOVE STORIES because they be so exciting .
But the master would not let them .
`` If you have DIED , Peter , and YOUR FATHER have hear it would n't he have FELT DREADFUL ?
We be have BEAUTIFUL WEATHER and the seenary be fine since the leaf turn .
I think there be nothing so pretty a Nature after all .
`` I hope ALL DANGER from the measles will soon be over and we can ALL MEET AGAIN AT THE HOME ON THE HILL .

`` P. S. Do n't let Felicity see this letter .
S. R. '' DAN 'S LETTER `` DEAR OLD PETE : -- Awful glad you cheat the doctor .

The Story Girl be get hers from Paris and Felicity be awful jealous though she pretend she be n't .
I can see through her .

She want some tobacco and some pickle .
Ma give her some pickle but say we do n't have no tobacco and Peg go off mad but I guess she would n't bewitch anything on account of the pickle .
`` I ai n't any hand to write letter so I guess I 'll stop .
Hope you 'll be out soon .
DAN . ''
THE STORY GIRL 'S LETTER `` DEAR PETER : -- Oh , how glad I be that you be get good !
Those day when we think you would n't be the hard of my whole life .
It seem too dreadful to be true that perhaps you would die .
And then when we hear you be go to get good that seem too good to be true .
Oh , Peter , hurry up and get well , for we be have such good time and we miss you so much .
I have coax Uncle Alec not to burn his potato stalk till you be well , because I remember how you always like to see the potato stalk burn .
Uncle Alec consent , though Aunt Janet say it be high time they be burn .
Uncle Roger burn his last night and it be such fun .
`` Pat be splendid .
He have never have a sick spell since that bad one .
I would send him over to be company for you , but Aunt Janet say no , because he might carry the measles back .
I do n't see how he could , but we must obey Aunt Janet .
She be very good to u all , but I know she do not approve of me .
She say I 'm my father 's own child .
I know that do n't mean anything complimentary because she look so queer when she saw that I have hear her , but I do n't care .
I 'm glad I 'm like father .
I have a splendid letter from him this week , with the darling picture in it .
He be paint a new picture which be go to make him famous .
I wonder what Aunt Janet will say then .
`` Do you know , Peter , yesterday I think I saw the Family Ghost at last .
I be come through the gap in the hedge , and I saw somebody in blue stand under Uncle Alec 's tree .
How my heart beat !
My hair should have stand up on end with terror but it do n't .
I felt to see , and it be lie down quite flat .
But it be only a visitor after all .
I do n't know whether I be glad or disappointed .
I do n't think it would be a pleasant experience to see the ghost .
But after I have see it think what a heroine I would be !
`` Oh , Peter , what do you think ?
I have get acquaint with the Awkward Man at last .
I never think it would be so easy .
Yesterday Aunt Olivia want some fern , so I go back to the maple wood to get them for her , and I find some lovely one by the spring .
And while I be sit there , look into the spring who should come along but the Awkward Man himself .
He sit right down beside me and begin to talk .
I never be so surprised in my life .
We have a very interesting talk , and I tell him two of my best story , and a great many of my secret into the bargain .
They may say what they like , but he be not one bit shy or awkward , and he have beautiful eye .
He do not tell me any of his secret , but I believe he will some day .
Of course I never say a word about his Alice-room .
But I give him a hint about his little brown book .
I say I love poetry and often felt like write it , and then I say , ` Do you ever feel like that , Mr. Dale ? '
He say , yes , he sometimes felt that way , but he do not mention the brown book .
I think he might have .
But after all I do n't like people who tell you everything the first time you meet them , like Sara Ray .
When he go away he say , ' I hope I shall have the pleasure of meeting you again , ' just a seriously and politely a if I be a grown-up young lady .
I be sure he could never have say it if I have be really grow up .
I tell him it be likely he would and that he be n't to mind if I have a longer skirt on next time , because I 'd be just the same person .
`` I tell the child a beautiful new fairy story to-day .
I make them go to the spruce wood to hear it .
A spruce wood be the proper place to tell fairy story in .
Felicity say she ca n't see that it make any difference where you tell them , but oh , it do .
I wish you have be there to hear it too , but when you be well I will tell it over again for you .
`` I be go to call the southernwood ` appleringie ' after this .
Beverley say that be what they call it in Scotland , and I think it sound so much more poetical than southernwood .
Felicity say the right name be ` Boy 's Love , ' but I think that sound silly .
`` Oh , Peter , shadow be such pretty thing .
The orchard be full of them this very minute .
Sometimes they be so still you would think them asleep .
Then they go laugh and skip .
Outside , in the oat field , they be always chase each other .
They be the wild shadow .
The shadow in the orchard be the tame shadow .
`` Everything seem to be rather tired grow except the spruce and chrysanthemum in Aunt Olivia 's garden .
The sunshine be so thick and yellow and lazy , and the cricket sing all day long .
The bird be nearly all go and most of the maple leaf have fall .
`` Just to make you laugh I 'll write you a little story I hear Uncle Alec tell last night .
It be about Elder Frewen 's grandfather take a pair of rope rein to lead a piano home .
Everybody laugh except Aunt Janet .
Old Mr. Frewen be HER grandfather too , and she would n't laugh .
One day when old Mr. Frewen be a young man of eighteen his father come home and say , ` Sandy , I buy a piano at Simon Ward 's sale to-day .
You 're to go to-morrow and bring it home . '
So next day Sandy start off on horseback with a pair of rope rein to lead the piano home .
He think it be some kind of livestock .
`` And then Uncle Roger tell about old Mark Ward who get up to make a speech at a church missionary social when he be drunk .
-LRB- Of course he do n't get drunk at the social .
He go there that way . -RRB-
And this be his speech . ''
` Ladies and gentleman , Mr. Chairman , I ca n't express my thought on this grand subject of mission .
It 's in this poor human critter ' -- pat himself on the breast -- ` but he ca n't git it out . '
`` I 'll tell you these story when you get well .
I can tell them ever so much good than I can write them .
`` I know Felicity be wonder why I 'm write such a long letter , so perhaps I 'd better stop .
If your mother read it to you there be a good deal of it she may not understand , but I think your Aunt Jane would .
`` I remain `` your very affectionate friend , `` SARA STANLEY . ''
I do not keep a copy of my own letter , and I have forget everything that be in it , except the first sentence , in which I tell Peter I be awful glad he be get well .
Peter 's delight on receive our letter know no bound .
He insist on answer them and his letter , painstakingly disinfect , be duly deliver to u .
Aunt Olivia have write it at his dictation , which be a gain , as far a spell and punctuation go .
But Peter 's individuality seem merge and lose in Aunt Olivia 's big , dash script .
Not until the Story Girl read the letter to u in the granary by jack-o-lantern light , in a mimicry of Peter 's very voice , do we savour the real bouquet of it .
PETER 'S LETTER `` DEAR EVERYBODY , BUT ESPECIALLY FELICITY : -- I be awful glad to get your letter .
It make you real important to be sick , but the time seem awful long when you 're get good .
Your letter be all great , but I like Felicity 's best , and next to hers the Story Girl 's .
Felicity , it will be awful good of you to send me thing to eat and the rosebud plate .
I 'll be awful careful of it .
I hope you wo n't catch the measles , for they be not nice , especially when they strike in , but you would look all right , even if you do have red spot on your face .
I would like to try the Mexican Tea , because you want me to , but mother say no , she do n't believe in it , and Burtons Bitters be a great deal healthier .
If I be you I would get the velvet hood all right .
The heathen live in warm country so they do n't want hood .
`` I 'm glad you be still pray for me , Cecily , for you ca n't trust the measles .
And I 'm glad you 're keep you know what for me .
I do n't believe anything will happen to you if you do take the measles ; but if anything do I 'd like that little red book of yours , The Safe Compass , just to remember you by .
It 's such a good book to read on Sundays .
It be interesting and religious , too .
So be the Bible .
I have n't quite finish the Bible before I take the measles , but ma be read the last chapter to me .
There 's an awful lot in that book .
I ca n't understand the whole of it , since I 'm only a hired boy , but some part be real easy .
`` I 'm awful glad you have such a good opinion of me .
I do n't deserve it , but after this I 'll try to .
I ca n't tell you how I feel about all your kindness .
I 'm like the fellow the Story Girl write about who could n't get it out .
I have the picture the Story Girl give me for my sermon on the wall at the foot of my bed .
I like to look at it , it look so much like Aunt Jane .
`` Felix , I 've give up pray that I 'd be the only one to eat the bitter apple , and I 'll never pray for anything like that again .
It be a horrid mean prayer .
I do n't know it then , but after the measles strike in I find out it be .
Aunt Jane would n't have like it .
After this I 'm go to pray prayer I need n't be ashamed of .
`` Sara Ray , I do n't know what it feel like to be go to die because I do n't know I be go to die till I get well .
Mother say I be luny most of the time after they strike in .
It be just because they strike in I be luny .
I ai n't luny naturally , Felicity .
I will do what you ask in your postscript , Sara , although it will be hard .
`` I 'm glad Peg Bowen do n't catch you , Dan .
Maybe she bewitch me that night we be at her place , and that be why the measles strike in .
I 'm awful glad Mr. King be go to leave the potato stalk until I get well , and I 'm oblige to the Story Girl for coax him .
I guess she will find out about Alice yet .
There be some part of her letter I could n't see through , but when the measles strike in , they leave you stupid for a spell .
Anyhow , it be a fine letter , and they be all fine , and I 'm awful glad I have so many nice friend , even if I be only a hired boy .
Perhaps I 'd never have find it out if the measles have n't strike in .
So I 'm glad they do but I hope they never will again .
`` Your obedient servant , `` PETER CRAIG . ''
CHAPTER XXXI .
ON THE EDGE OF LIGHT AND DARK We celebrate the November day when Peter be permit to rejoin u by a picnic in the orchard .
Sara Ray be also allow to come , under protest ; and her joy over be among u once more be almost pathetic .
She and Cecily cry in one another 's arm a if they have be part for year .
We have a beautiful day for our picnic .
November dream that it be May .
The air be soft and mellow , with pale , aerial mist in the valley and over the leafless beech on the western hill .
The sere stubble field brood in glamour , and the sky be pearly blue .
The leaf be still thick on the apple tree , though they be russet hue , and the after-growth of grass be richly green , unharmed a yet by the nipping frost of previous night .
The wind make a sweet , drowsy murmur in the bough , a of bee among apple blossom .
`` It 's just like spring , be n't it ? ''
ask Felicity .
The Story Girl shake her head .
`` No , not quite .
It look like spring , but it be n't spring .
It 's a if everything be rest -- get ready to sleep .
In spring they 're get ready to grow .
Ca n't you FEEL the difference ? ''
`` I think it 's just like spring , '' insist Felicity .
In the sun-sweet place before the Pulpit Stone we boys have put up a board table .
Aunt Janet allow u to cover it with an old tablecloth , the worn place in which the girl artfully conceal with frost-whitened fern .
We have the kitchen dish , and the table be gaily decorate with Cecily 's three scarlet geranium and maple leaf in the cherry vase .
As for the viand , they be fit for the god on high Olympus .
Felicity have spend the whole previous day and the forenoon of the picnic day in concoct them .
Her crown achievement be a rich little plum cake , on the white frosting of which the word `` Welcome Back '' be letter in pink candy .
This be put before Peter 's place , and almost overcame him .
`` To think that you 'd go to so much trouble for me ! ''
he say , with a glance of adore gratitude at Felicity .
Felicity get all the gratitude , although the Story Girl have originate the idea and seed the raisin and beat the egg , while Cecily have trudge all the way to Mrs. Jameson 's little shop below the church to buy the pink candy .
But that be the way of the world .
`` We ought to have grace , '' say Felicity , a we sit down at the festal board .
`` Will any one say it ? ''
She look at me , but I blush to the root of my hair and shake my head sheepishly .
An awkward pause ensue ; it look a if we would have to proceed without grace , when Felix suddenly shut his eye , bend his head , and say a very good grace without any appearance of embarrassment .
We look at him when it be over with an increase of respect .
`` Where on earth do you learn that , Felix ? ''
I ask .
`` It 's the grace Uncle Alec say at every meal , '' answer Felix .
We felt rather ashamed of ourselves .
Was it possible that we have pay so little attention to Uncle Alec 's grace that we do not recognize it when we hear it on other lip ?
`` Now , '' say Felicity jubilantly , `` let 's eat everything up . ''
In truth , it be a merry little feast .
We have go without our dinner , in order to `` save our appetite , '' and we do ample justice to Felicity 's good thing .
Paddy sit on the Pulpit Stone and watch u with great yellow eye , know that tidbit would come his way later on .
Many witty thing be say -- or at least we think them witty -- and uproarious be the laughter .
Never have the old King orchard know a blither merrymaking or light heart .
The picnic over , we play game until the early fall dusk , and then we go with Uncle Alec to the back field to burn the potato stalk -- the crown delight of the day .
The stalk be in heap all over the field , and we be allow the privilege of set fire to them .
'T be glorious !
In a few minute the field be alight with blazing bonfire , over which roll great , pungent cloud of smoke .
From pile to pile we run , shriek with delight , to poke each up with a long stick and watch the gush of rose-red spark stream off into the night .
In what a whirl of smoke and firelight and wild , fantastic , hurtle shadow we be !
When we grow tire of our sport we go to the windward side of the field and perched ourselves on the high pole fence that skirt a dark spruce wood , full of strange , furtive sound .
Over u be a great , dark sky , blossom with silver star , and all around lay dusky , mysterious reach of meadow and wood in the soft , empurple night .
Away to the east a shimmering silveryness beneath a palace of aerial cloud foretokened moonrise .
But directly before u the potato field , with it wreathe smoke and sullen flame , the gigantic shadow of Uncle Alec crossing and recrossing it , remind u of Peter 's famous description of the bad place , and probably suggest the Story Girl 's remark .
`` I know a story , '' she say , infuse just the right shade of weirdness into her voice , `` about a man who saw the devil .
Now , what 's the matter , Felicity ? ''
`` I can never get use to the way you mention the -- the -- that name , '' complain Felicity .
`` To hear you speak of the Old Scratch any one would think he be just a common person . ''
`` Never mind .
Tell u the story , '' I say curiously .
`` It be about Mrs. John Martin 's uncle at Markdale , '' say the Story Girl .
`` I hear Uncle Roger tell it the other night .
He do n't know I be sit on the cellar hatch outside the window , or I do n't suppose he would have tell it .
Mrs. Martin 's uncle 's name be William Cowan , and he have be dead for twenty year ; but sixty year ago he be a young man , and a very wild , wicked young man .
He do everything bad he could think of , and never go to church , and he laugh at everything religious , even the devil .
He do n't believe there be a devil at all .
One beautiful summer Sunday even his mother plead with him to go to church with her , but he would not .
He tell her that he be go fishing instead , and when church time come he swagger past the church , with his fishing rod over his shoulder , sing a godless song .
Half way between the church and the harbour there be a thick spruce wood , and the path run through it .
When William Cowan be half way through it SOMETHING come out of the wood and walk beside him . ''
I have never hear anything more horribly suggestive than that innocent word `` something , '' a enunciate by the Story Girl .
I felt Cecily 's hand , icy cold , clutch mine .
`` What -- what -- be IT like ? ''
whispered Felix , curiosity get the good of his terror .
`` IT be tall , and black , and hairy , '' say the Story Girl , her eye glow with uncanny intensity in the red glare of the fire , `` and IT lift one great , hairy hand , with claw on the end of it , and clap William Cowan , first on one shoulder and then on the other , and say , ` Good sport to you , brother . '
William Cowan give a horrible scream and fell on his face right there in the wood .
Some of the men around the church door hear the scream , and they rush down to the wood .
They saw nothing but William Cowan , lie like a dead man on the path .
They take him up and carry him home ; and when they undress him to put him to bed , there , on each shoulder , be the mark of a big hand , BURNED INTO THE FLESH .
It be week before the burn heal , and the scar never go away .
Always , as long a William Cowan live , he carry on his shoulder the print of the devil 's hand . ''
I really do not know how we should ever have get home , have we be leave to our own device .
We be cold with fright .
How could we turn our back on the eerie spruce wood , out of which SOMETHING might pop at any moment ?
How cross those long , shadowy field between u and our rooftree ?
How venture through the darkly mysterious bracken hollow ?
Fortunately , Uncle Alec come along at this crisis and say he think we 'd well come home now , since the fire be nearly out .
We slide down from the fence and start , take care to keep close together and in front of Uncle Alec .
`` I do n't believe a word of that yarn , '' say Dan , try to speak with his usual incredulity .
`` I do n't see how you can help believe it , '' say Cecily .
`` It be n't a if it be something we 'd read of , or that happen far away .
It happen just down at Markdale , and I 've see that very spruce wood myself . ''
`` Oh , I suppose William Cowan get a fright of some kind , '' concede Dan , `` but I do n't believe he saw the devil . ''
`` Old Mr. Morrison at Lower Markdale be one of the men who undress him , and he remember see the mark , '' say the Story Girl triumphantly .
`` How do William Cowan behave afterwards ? ''
I ask .
`` He be a changed man , '' say the Story Girl solemnly .
`` Too much change .
He never be know to laugh again , or even smile .
He become a very religious man , which be a good thing , but he be dreadfully gloomy and think everything pleasant sinful .
He would n't even eat any more than be actually necessary to keep him alive .
Uncle Roger say that if he have be a Roman Catholic he would have become a monk , but , a he be a Presbyterian , all he could do be to turn into a crank . ''
`` Yes , but your Uncle Roger be never clap on the shoulder and call brother by the devil , '' say Peter .
`` If he have , he might n't have be so precious jolly afterwards himself . ''
`` I do wish to goodness , '' say Felicity in exasperation , `` that you 'd stop talk of the -- the -- of such subject in the dark .
I 'm so scared now that I keep think father 's step behind u be SOMETHING 'S .
Just think , my own father ! ''
The Story Girl slip her arm through Felicity 's .
`` Never mind , '' she say soothingly .
`` I 'll tell you another story -- such a beautiful story that you 'll forget all about the devil . ''
She tell u one of Hans Andersen 's most exquisite tale ; and the magic of her voice charm away all our fear , so that when we reach the bracken hollow , a lake of shadow surround by the silver shore of moonlit field , we all go through it without a thought of His Satanic Majesty at all .
And beyond u , on the hill , the homelight be glow from the farmhouse window like a beacon of old love .
CHAPTER XXXII .
THE OPENING OF THE BLUE CHEST November waken from her dream of May in a bad temper .
The day after the picnic a cold autumn rain set in , and we get up to find our world a drench , wind-writhen place , with sodden field and dour sky .
The rain be weep on the roof a if it be shed the tear of old sorrow ; the willow by the gate toss it gaunt branch wildly , a if it be some passionate , spectral thing , wring it fleshless hand in agony ; the orchard be haggard and uncomely ; nothing seem the same except the staunch , trusty , old spruce .
It be Friday , but we be not to begin go to school again until Monday , so we spend the day in the granary , sort apple and hear tale .
In the even the rain cease , the wind come around to the northwest , freeze suddenly , and a chilly yellow sunset beyond the dark hill seem to herald a brighter morrow .
Felicity and the Story Girl and I walk down to the post-office for the mail , along a road where fall leave go eddy fitfully up and down before u in weird , uncanny dance of their own .
The evening be full of eerie sound -- the creaking of fir bough , the whistle of the wind in the tree-tops , the vibration of strip of dried bark on the rail fence .
But we carry summer and sunshine in our heart , and the bleak unloveliness of the outer world only intensify our inner radiance .
Felicity wear her new velvet hood , with a coquettish little collar of white fur about her neck .
Her golden curl frame her lovely face , and the wind sting the pink of her cheek to crimson .
On my left hand walk the Story Girl , her red cap on her jaunty brown head .
She scatter her word along the path like the pearl and diamond of the old fairy tale .
I remember that I strut along quite insufferably , for we meet several of the Carlisle boy and I felt that I be an exceptionally lucky fellow to have such beauty on one side and such charm on the other .
There be one of father 's thin letter for Felix , a fat , foreign letter for the Story Girl , address in her father 's minute handwriting , a drop letter for Cecily from some school friend , with `` In Haste '' write across the corner , and a letter for Aunt Janet , postmark Montreal .
`` I ca n't think who that be from , '' say Felicity .
`` Nobody in Montreal ever write to mother .
Cecily 's letter be from Em Frewen .
She always put ` In Haste ' on her letter , no matter what be in them . ''
When we reach home , Aunt Janet open and read her Montreal letter .
Then she lay it down and look about her in astonishment .
`` Well , do ever any mortal ! ''
she say .
`` What in the world be the matter ? ''
say Uncle Alec .
`` This letter be from James Ward 's wife in Montreal , '' say Aunt Janet solemnly .
`` Rachel Ward be dead .
And she tell James ' wife to write to me and tell me to open the old blue chest . ''
`` Hurrah ! ''
shout Dan .
`` Donald King , '' say his mother severely , `` Rachel Ward be your relation and she be dead .
What do you mean by such behaviour ? ''
`` I never be acquaint with her , '' say Dan sulkily .
`` And I be n't hurrah because she be dead .
I hurrah because that blue chest be to be open at last . ''
`` So poor Rachel be go , '' say Uncle Alec .
`` She must have be an old woman -- seventy-five I suppose .
I remember her a a fine , bloom young woman .
Well , well , and so the old chest be to be open at last .
What be to be do with it content ? ''
`` Rachel leave instruction about them , '' answer Aunt Janet , refer to the letter .
`` The wedding dress and veil and letter be to be burn .
There be two jug in it which be to be send to James ' wife .
The rest of the thing be to be give around among the connection .
Each member be to have one , ` to remember her by . ' ''
`` Oh , ca n't we open it right away this very night ? ''
say Felicity eagerly .
`` No , indeed ! ''
Aunt Janet fold up the letter decidedly .
`` That chest have be lock up for fifty year , and it 'll stand be lock up one more night .
You child would n't sleep a wink to-night if we open it now .
You 'd go wild with excitement . ''
`` I 'm sure I wo n't sleep anyhow , '' say Felicity .
`` Well , at least you 'll open it the first thing in the morning , wo n't you , ma ? ''
`` No , I 'll do nothing of the sort , '' be Aunt Janet 's pitiless decree .
`` I want to get the work out of the way first -- and Roger and Olivia will want to be here , too .
We 'll say ten o'clock to-morrow forenoon . ''
`` That 's sixteen whole hour yet , '' sigh Felicity .
`` I 'm go right over to tell the Story Girl , '' say Cecily .
`` Wo n't she be excite ! ''
We be all excite .
We spend the even speculating on the possible content of the chest , and Cecily dream miserably that night that the moth have eat everything in it .
The morning dawn on a beautiful world .
A very slight fall of snow have come in the night -- just enough to look like a filmy veil of lace flung over the dark evergreens , and the hard frozen ground .
A new blossom time seem to have revisit the orchard .
The spruce wood behind the house appear to be weave out of enchantment .
There be nothing more beautiful than a thickly grow wood of fir lightly powder with new-fallen snow .
As the sun remain hide by gray cloud , this fairy-beauty last all day .
The Story Girl come over early in the morning , and Sara Ray , to whom faithful Cecily have send word , be also on hand .
Felicity do not approve of this .
`` Sara Ray be n't any relation to our family , '' she scold to Cecily , `` and she have no right to be present . ''
`` She 's a particular friend of mine , '' say Cecily with dignity .
`` We have her in everything , and it would hurt her feeling dreadfully to be leave out of this .
Peter be no relation either , but he be go to be here when we open it , so why should n't Sara ? ''
`` Peter ai n't a member of the family YET , but maybe he will be some day .
Hey , Felicity ? ''
say Dan .
`` You 're awful smart , be n't you , Dan King ? ''
say Felicity , redden .
`` Perhaps you 'd like to send for Kitty Marr , too -- though she DOES laugh at your big mouth . ''
`` It seem a if ten o'clock would never come , '' sigh the Story Girl .
`` The work be all do , and Aunt Olivia and Uncle Roger be here , and the chest might just as well be open right away . ''
`` Mother SAID ten o'clock and she 'll stick to it , '' say Felicity crossly .
`` It 's only nine now . ''
`` Let u put the clock on half an hour , '' say the Story Girl .
`` The clock in the hall be n't go , so no one will know the difference . ''
We all look at each other .
`` I would n't dare , '' say Felicity irresolutely .
`` Oh , if that 's all , I 'll do it , '' say the Story Girl .
When ten o'clock struck Aunt Janet come into the kitchen , remark innocently that it have n't seem anytime since nine .
We must have look horribly guilty , but none of the grown-ups suspect anything .
Uncle Alec bring in the axe , and pry off the cover of the old blue chest , while everybody stand around in silence .
Then come the unpacking .
It be certainly an interesting performance .
Aunt Janet and Aunt Olivia take everything out and lay it on the kitchen table .
We child be forbid to touch anything , but fortunately we be not forbid the use of our eye and tongue .
`` There be the pink and gold vas Grandmother King give her , '' say Felicity , a Aunt Olivia unwrap from their tissue paper swathe a pair of slender , old-fashioned , twisted vas of pink glass , over which little gold leaf be scatter .
`` Are n't they handsome ? ''
`` And oh , '' exclaim Cecily in delight , `` there 's the china fruit basket with the apple on the handle .
Does n't it look real ?
I 've think so much about it .
Oh , mother , please let me hold it for a minute .
I 'll be as careful a careful . ''
`` There come the china set Grandfather King give her , '' say the Story Girl wistfully .
`` Oh , it make me feel sad .
Think of all the hope that Rachel Ward must have put away in this chest with all her pretty thing . ''
Following these , come a quaint little candlestick of blue china , and the two jug which be to be send to James ' wife .
`` They ARE handsome , '' say Aunt Janet rather enviously .
`` They must be a hundred year old .
Aunt Sara Ward give them to Rachel , and she have them for at least fifty year .
I should have think one would have be enough for James ' wife .
But of course we must do just a Rachel wish .
I declare , here 's a dozen tin patty pan ! ''
`` Tin patty pan be n't very romantic , '' say the Story Girl discontentedly .
`` I notice that you be as fond a any one of what be bake in them , '' say Aunt Janet .
`` I 've hear of those patty pan .
An old servant Grandmother King have give them to Rachel .
Now we be come to the linen .
That be Uncle Edward Ward 's present .
How yellow it have grow . ''
We child be not greatly interested in the sheet and tablecloth and pillow-cases which now come out of the capacious depth of the old blue chest .
But Aunt Olivia be quite enrapture over them .
`` What sewing ! ''
she say .
`` Look , Janet , you 'd almost need a magnify glass to see the stitch .
And the dear , old-fashioned pillow-slips with button on them ! ''
`` Here be a dozen handkerchief , '' say Aunt Janet .
`` Look at the initial in the corner of each .
Rachel learn that stitch from a nun in Montreal .
It look a if it be weave into the material . ''
`` Here be her quilt , '' say Aunt Olivia .
`` Yes , there be the blue and white counterpane Grandmother Ward give her -- and the Rising Sun quilt her Aunt Nancy make for her -- and the braided rug .
The colour be not fade one bit .
I want that rug , Janet . ''
Underneath the linen be Rachel Ward 's wedding clothes .
The excitement of the girl wax red hot over these .
There be a Paisley shawl in the wrapping in which it have come from the store , and a wide scarf of some yellowed lace .
There be the embroidered petticoat which have cost Felicity such painful blush , and a dozen beautifully work set of the fine muslin `` undersleeves '' which have be the fashion in Rachel Ward 's youth .
`` This be to have be her appear out dress , '' say Aunt Olivia , lift out a shot green silk .
`` It be all cut to piece -- but what a pretty soft shade it be !
Look at the skirt , Janet .
How many yard must it measure around ? ''
`` Hoopskirts be in then , '' say Aunt Janet .
`` I do n't see her wed hat here .
I be always tell that she pack it away , too . ''
`` So be I .
But she could n't have .
It certainly be n't here .
I have hear that the white plume on it cost a small fortune .
Here be her black silk mantle .
It seem like sacrilege to meddle with these clothes . ''
`` Do n't be foolish , Olivia .
They must be unpack at least .
And they must all be burn since they have cut so badly .
This purple cloth dress be quite good , however .
It can be make over nicely , and it would become you very well , Olivia . ''
`` No , thank you , '' say Aunt Olivia , with a little shudder .
`` I should feel like a ghost .
Make it over for yourself , Janet . ''
`` Well , I will , if you do n't want it .
I be not troubled with fancy .
That seem to be all except this box .
I suppose the wedding dress be in it . ''
`` Oh , '' breathe the girl , crowd about Aunt Olivia , a she lift out the box and cut the cord around it .
Inside be lie a dress of soft silk , that have once be white but be now yellow with age , and , enfold it like a mist , a long , white bridal veil , redolent with some strange , old-time perfume that have keep it sweetness through all the year .
`` Poor Rachel Ward , '' say Aunt Olivia softly .
`` Here be her point lace handkerchief .
She make it herself .
It be like a spider 's web .
Here be the letter Will Montague write her .
And here , '' she add , take up a crimson velvet case with a tarnished gilt clasp , `` be their photograph -- his and hers . ''
We look eagerly at the daguerreotype in the old case .
`` Why , Rachel Ward be n't a bit pretty ! ''
exclaim the Story Girl in poignant disappointment .
No , Rachel Ward be not pretty , that have to be admit .
The picture show a fresh young face , with strongly mark , irregular feature , large black eye , and black curl hang around the shoulder in old-time style .
`` Rachel be n't pretty , '' say Uncle Alec , `` but she have a lovely colour , and a beautiful smile .
She look far too sober in that picture . ''
`` She have a beautiful neck and bust , '' say Aunt Olivia critically .
`` Anyhow , Will Montague be really handsome , '' say the Story Girl .
`` A handsome rogue , '' growl Uncle Alec .
`` I never like him .
I be only a little chap of ten but I saw through him .
Rachel Ward be far too good for him . ''
We would dearly have like to get a peep into the letter , too .
But Aunt Olivia would not allow that .
They must be burn unread , she declare .
She take the wedding dress and veil , the picture case , and the letter away with her .
The rest of the thing be put back into the chest , pending their ultimate distribution .
Aunt Janet give each of u boys a handkerchief .
The Story Girl get the blue candlestick , and Felicity and Cecily each get a pink and gold vase .
Even Sara Ray be make happy by the gift of a little china plate , with a loudly coloured picture of Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh in the middle of it .
Moses wear a scarlet cloak , while Aaron disport himself in bright blue .
Pharaoh be array in yellow .
The plate have a scallop border with a wreath of green leaf around it .
`` I shall never use it to eat off , '' say Sara rapturously .
`` I 'll put it up on the parlour mantelpiece . ''
`` I do n't see much use in have a plate just for ornament , '' say Felicity .
`` It 's nice to have something interest to look at , '' retort Sara , who felt that the soul must have food as well a the body .
`` I 'm go to get a candle for my candlestick , and use it every night to go to bed with , '' say the Story Girl .
`` And I 'll never light it without think of poor Rachel Ward .
But I DO wish she have be pretty . ''
`` Well , '' say Felicity , with a glance at the clock , `` it 's all over , and it have be very interesting .
But that clock have get to be put back to the right time some time through the day .
I do n't want bedtime come a whole half-hour before it ought to . ''
In the afternoon , when Aunt Janet be over at Uncle Roger 's , see him and Aunt Olivia off to town , the clock be right .
The Story Girl and Peter come over to stay all night with u , and we make taffy in the kitchen , which the grown-ups kindly give over to u for that purpose .
`` Of course it be very interesting to see the old chest unpack , '' say the Story Girl a she stir the content of a saucepan vigorously .
`` But now that it be over I believe I be sorry that it be open .
It be n't mysterious any longer .
We know all about it now , and we can never imagine what thing be in it any more . ''
`` It 's good to know than to imagine , '' say Felicity .
`` Oh , no , it be n't , '' say the Story Girl quickly .
`` When you know thing you have to go by fact .
But when you just dream about thing there 's nothing to hold you down . ''
`` You 're let the taffy scorch , and THAT 'S a fact you 'd better go by , '' say Felicity sniffing .
`` Have n't you get a nose ? ''
When we go to bed , that wonderful white enchantress , the moon , be make an elf-land of the snow-misted world outside .
From where I lay I could see the sharp top of the spruce against the silvery sky .
The frost be abroad , and the wind be still and the land lay in glamour .
Across the hall , the Story Girl be tell Felicity and Cecily the old , old tale of Argive Helen and `` evil-hearted Paris . ''
`` But that 's a bad story , '' say Felicity when the tale be end .
`` She leave her husband and run away with another man . ''
`` I suppose it be bad four thousand year ago , '' admit the Story Girl .
`` But by this time the bad must have all go out of it .
It 's only the good that could last so long . ''
Our summer be over .
It have be a beautiful one .
We have know the sweetness of common joy , the delight of dawn , the dream and glamour of noontide , the long , purple peace of carefree night .
We have have the pleasure of bird song , of silver rain on green field , of storm among the tree , of blossom meadow , and of the converse of whisper leaf .
We have have brotherhood with wind and star , with book and tale , and hearth fire of autumn .
Ours have be the little , love task of every day , blithe companionship , share thought , and adventure .
Rich be we in the memory of those opulent month that have go from u -- rich than we then know or suspect .
And before u be the dream of spring .
It be always safe to dream of spring .
For it be sure to come ; and if it be not just a we have picture it , it will be infinitely sweeter .

DING-DONG !
Ding-dong !
Ding-dong !
The town crier have ring his bell , at a distant corner , and little Annie stand on her father 's doorstep , try to hear what the man with the loud voice be talk about .
Let me listen too .
O , he be tell the people that an elephant , and a lion , and a royal tiger , and a horse with horn , and other strange beast from foreign country , have come to town , and will receive all visitor who choose to wait upon them !
Perhaps little Annie would like to go .
Yes ; and I can see that the pretty child be weary of this wide and pleasant street , with the green tree fling their shade across the quiet sunshine , and the pavement and the sidewalk all as clean a if the housemaid have just sweep them with her broom .
She feel that impulse to go stroll away -- that longing after the mystery of the great world -- which many child feel , and which I felt in my childhood .
Little Annie shall take a ramble with me .
See !
I do but hold out my hand , and , like some bright bird in the sunny air , with her blue silk frock flutter upwards from her white pantalets , she come bound on tiptoe across the street .
Smooth back your brown curl , Annie ; and let me tie on your bonnet , and we will set forth !
What a strange couple to go on their ramble together !
One walk in black attire , with a measured step , and a heavy brow , and his thoughtful eye bend down , while the gay little girl trip lightly along , a if she be force to keep hold of my hand , lest her foot should dance away from the earth .
Yet there be sympathy between u .
If I pride myself on anything , it be because I have a smile that child love ; and , on the other hand , there be few grown lady that could entice me from the side of little Annie ; for I delight to let my mind go hand in hand with the mind of a sinless child .
So , come , Annie ; but if I moralize a we go , do not listen to me ; only look about you , and be merry !
Now we turn the corner .
Here be hack with two horse , and stage-coaches with four , thunder to meet each other , and truck and cart move at a slow pace , be heavily lade with barrel from the wharf , and here be rattle gig , which perhaps will be smash to piece before our eye .
Hitherward , also , come a man trundle a wheelbarrow along the pavement .
Is not little Annie afraid of such a tumult ?
No ; she do not even shrink close to my side , but pass on with fearless confidence , a happy child amidst a great throng of grown people , who pay the same reverence to her infancy that they would to extreme old age .
Nobody jostle her ; all turn aside to make way for little Annie ; and , what be most singular , she appear conscious of her claim to such respect .
Now her eye brighten with pleasure !
A street-musician have seat himself on the step of yonder church , and pours forth his strain to the busy town , a melody that have go astray among the tramp of footstep , the buzz of voice , and the war of pass wheel .
Who heed the poor organ-grinder ?
None but myself and little Annie , whose foot begin to move in unison with the lively tune , a if she be loath that music should be waste without a dance .
But where would Annie find a partner ?
Some have the gout in their toe , or the rheumatism in their joint ; some be stiff with age ; some feeble with disease ; some be so lean that their bone would rattle , and others of such ponderous size that their agility would crack the flagstone ; but many , many have leaden foot , because their heart be far heavy than lead .
It be a sad thought that I have chance upon .
What a company of dancer should we be !
For I , too , be a gentleman of sober footstep , and therefore , little Annie , let u walk sedately on .
It be a question with me , whether this giddy child , or my sage self , have most pleasure in look at the shop-windows .
We love the silk of sunny hue , that glow within the darkened premise of the spruce drygoods ' men ; we be pleasantly dazzle by the burnish silver , and the chased gold , the ring of wedlock and the costly love-ornaments , glisten at the window of the jeweller ; but Annie , more than I , seek for a glimpse of her passing figure in the dusty looking-glasses at the hardware store .
All that be bright and gay attracts u both .
Here be a shop to which the recollection of my boyhood , as well a present partiality , give a peculiar magic .
How delightful to let the fancy revel on the dainty of a confectioner ; those pie , with such white and flaky paste , their content be a mystery , whether rich mince , with whole plum intermix , or piquant apple , delicately rose-flavored ; those cake , heart-shaped or round , pile in a lofty pyramid ; those sweet little circlet , sweetly name kiss ; those dark , majestic mass , fit to be bridal-loaves at the wedding of an heiress , mountain in size , their summit deeply snow-covered with sugar !
Then the mighty treasure of sugar-plums , white and crimson and yellow , in large glass vas ; and candy of all variety ; and those little cockle , or whatever they be call , much prize by child for their sweetness , and more for the motto which they enclose , by love-sick maid and bachelor !
O , my mouth water , little Annie , and so doth yours ; but we will not be tempt , except to an imaginary feast ; so let u hasten onward , devour the vision of a plum-cake .
Here be pleasure , a some people would say , of a more exalted kind , in the window of a bookseller .
Is Annie a literary lady ?
Yes ; she be deeply read in Peter Parley 's tome , and have an increase love for fairy-tales , though seldom meet with nowadays , and she will subscribe , next year , to the Juvenile Miscellany .
But , truth to tell , she be apt to turn away from the printed page , and keep gazing at the pretty picture , such a the gay-colored one which make this shopwindow the continual loitering-place of child .
What would Annie think , if , in the book which I mean to send her , on New Year 's day , she should find her sweet little self , bind up in silk or morocco with gilt edge , there to remain till she become a woman grow with child of her own to read about their mother 's childhood !
That would be very queer .
Little Annie be weary of picture , and pull me onward by the hand , till suddenly we pause at the most wondrous shop in all the town .
O , my star !
Is this a toy-shop , or be it fairy-land ?
For here be gilded chariot , in which the king and queen of the fairy might ride side by side , while their courtier , on these small horse , should gallop in triumphal procession before and behind the royal pair .
Here , too , be dish of china-ware , fit to be the dining set of those same princely personage , when they make a regal banquet in the stately ball of their palace , full five foot high , and behold their noble feast adown the long perspective of the table .
Betwixt the king and queen should sit my little Annie , the pretty fairy of them all .
Here stand a turbaned Turk , threaten u with his sabre , like an ugly heathen a he be .
And next a Chinese mandarin , who nod his head at Annie and myself .
Here we may review a whole army of horse and foot , in red and blue uniform , with drum , fife , trumpet , and all kind of noiseless music ; they have halt on the shelf of this window , after their weary march from Liliput .
But what care Annie for soldier ?
No conquer queen be she , neither a Semiramis nor a Catharine , her whole heart be set upon that doll , who gaze at u with such a fashionable stare .
This be the little girl 's true plaything .
Though make of wood , a doll be a visionary and ethereal personage , endow by childish fancy with a peculiar life ; the mimic lady be a heroine of romance , an actor and a sufferer in a thousand shadowy scene , the chief inhabitant of that wild world with which child ape the real one .
Little Annie do not understand what I be say , but look wishfully at the proud lady in the window .
We will invite her home with u a we return .
Meantime , good by , Dame Doll !
A toy yourself , you look forth from your window upon many lady that be also toys , though they walk and speak , and upon a crowd in pursuit of toy , though they wear grave visage .
O , with your never-closing eye , have you but an intellect to moralize on all that flit before them , what a wise doll would you be !
Come , little Annie , we shall find toys enough , go where we may .
Now we elbow our way among the throng again .
It be curious , in the most crowded part of a town , to meet with living creature that have their birthplace in some far solitude , but have acquire a second nature in the wilderness of men .
Look up , Annie , at that canary-bird , hang out of the window in his cage .
Poor little fellow !
His golden feather be all tarnish in this smoky sunshine ; he would have glisten twice as brightly among the summer islands ; but still he have become a citizen in all his taste and habit , and would not sing half so well without the uproar that drown his music .
What a pity that he do not know how miserable he be !
There be a parrot , too , call out , `` Pretty Poll !
Pretty Poll ! ''
a we pass by .
Foolish bird , to be talk about her prettiness to stranger , especially a she be not a pretty Poll , though gaudily dress in green and yellow .
If she have say , `` Pretty Annie , '' there would have be some sense in it .
See that gray squirrel at the door of the fruit-shop , whirl round and round so merrily within his wire wheel !
Being condemn to the treadmill , he make it an amusement .
Admirable philosophy !
Here come a big , rough dog , a countryman 's dog in search of his master ; smell at everybody 's heel , and touch little Annie 's hand with his cold nose , but hurry away , though she would fain have pat him .
Success to your search , Fidelity !
And there sit a great yellow cat upon a window-sill , a very corpulent and comfortable cat , gaze at this transitory world , with owl 's eye , and make pithy comment , doubtless , or what appear such , to the silly beast .
O sage pus , make room for me beside you , and we will be a pair of philosopher !
Here we see something to remind u of the town crier , and his ding-dong bell !
Look !
look at that great cloth spread out in the air , picture all over with wild beast , a if they have meet together to choose a king , accord to their custom in the day of AEsop .
But they be choose neither a king nor a president ; else we should hear a most horrible snarling !
They have come from the deep wood , and the wild mountain , and the desert sand , and the polar snow , only to do homage to my little Annie .
As we enter among them , the great elephant make u a bow , in the best style of elephantine courtesy , bend lowly down his mountain bulk , with trunk abase , and leg thrust out behind .
Annie return the salute , much to the gratification of the elephant , who be certainly the best-bred monster in the caravan .
The lion and the lioness be busy with two beef-bones .
The royal tiger , the beautiful , the untamable , keep pace his narrow cage with a haughty step , unmindful of the spectator , or recall the fierce deed of his former life , when he be wont to leap forth upon such inferior animal , from the jungle of Bengal .
Here we see the very same wolf , -- do not go near him , Annie !
-- the self-same wolf that devour little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother .
In the next cage , a hyena from Egypt , who have doubtless howl around the pyramid , and a black bear from our own forest be fellow-prisoners , and most excellent friend .
Are there any two living creature who have so few sympathy that they can not possibly be friend ?
Here sit a great white bear , whom common observer would call a very stupid beast , though I perceive him to be only absorb in contemplation ; he be think of his voyage on an iceberg , and of his comfortable home in the vicinity of the north pole , and of the little cubs whom he leave roll in the eternal snow .
In fact , he be a bear of sentiment .
But , O , those unsentimental monkey the ugly , grin , ape , chatter , ill-natured , mischievous , and queer little brute .
Annie do not love the monkey .
Their ugliness shock her pure , instinctive delicacy of taste , and make her mind unquiet , because it bear a wild and dark resemblance to humanity .
But here be a little pony , just big enough for Annie to ride , and round and round he gallop in a circle , keep time with his trample hoof to a band of music .
And here , -- with a laced coat and a cocked hat , and a rid whip in his hand , -- here come a little gentleman , small enough to be king of the fairy , and ugly enough to be king of the gnome , and take a fly leap into the saddle .
Merrily , merrily play the music , and merrily gallop the pony , and merrily rid the little old gentleman .
Come , Annie , into the street again ; perchance we may see monkey on horseback there !
Mercy on u , what a noisy world we quiet people live in !
Did Annie ever read the Cries of London City ?
With what lusty lung doth yonder man proclaim that his wheelbarrow be full of lobster !
Here come another mount on a cart , and blow a hoarse and dreadful blast from a tin horn , as much a to say , `` Fresh fish ! ''
And hark !
a voice on high , like that of a muezzin from the summit of a mosque , announce that some chimney-sweeper have emerge from smoke and soot , and darksome cavern , into the upper air .
What care the world for that ?
But , well-a-day , we hear a shrill voice of affliction , the scream of a little child , rise louder with every repetition of that smart , sharp , slap sound , produce by an open hand on tender flesh .
Annie sympathize , though without experience of such direful woe .
Lo !
the town crier again , with some new secret for the public ear .
Will he tell u of an auction , or of a lost pocketbook , or a show of beautiful wax figure , or of some monstrous beast more horrible than any in the caravan ?
I guess the latter .
See how he uplift the bell in his right hand , and shake it slowly at first , then with a hurried motion , till the clapper seem to strike both side at once , and the sound be scattered forth in quick succession , far and near .
Ding-dong !
Ding-dong !
Ding-dong !
Now he raise his clear , loud voice , above all the din of the town ; it drown the buzzing talk of many tongue , and draw each man 's mind from his own business ; it roll up and down the echoing street and ascend to the hushed chamber of the sick , and penetrate downward to the cellar kitchen , where the hot cook turn from the fire to listen .
Who , of all that address the public ear , whether in church , or court-house , or hall of state , have such an attentive audience a the town crier ?
What saith the people 's orator ?
`` Strayed from her home , a LITTLE GIRL , of five year old , in a blue silk frock and white pantalets , with brown curl hair and hazel eye .
Whoever will bring her back to her afflicted mother -- '' Stop , stop , town crier !
The lost be find .
O , my pretty Annie , we forget to tell your mother of our ramble , and she be in despair , and have send the town crier to bellow up and down the street , afrighting old and young , for the loss of a little girl who have not once let go my hand !
Well , let u hasten homeward ; and a we go , forget not to thank Heaven , my Annie , that , after wander a little way into the world , you may return at the first summons , with an untainted and unwearied heart , and be a happy child again .
But I have go too far astray for the town crier to call me back .
Sweet have be the charm of childhood on my spirit , throughout my ramble with little Annie !
Say not that it have be a waste of precious moment , an idle matter , a babble of childish talk , and a revery of childish imagination , about topic unworthy of a grown man 's notice .
Has it be merely this ?
Not so ; not so .
They be not truly wise who would affirm it .
As the pure breath of child revive the life of age men , so be our moral nature revive by their free and simple thought , their native feeling , their airy mirth , for little cause or none , their grief , soon rouse and soon allay .
Their influence on u be at least reciprocal with ours on them .
When our infancy be almost forget , and our boyhood long depart , though it seem but a yesterday ; when life settle darkly down upon u , and we doubt whether to call ourselves young any more , then it be good to steal away from the society of beard men , and even of gentler woman , and spend an hour or two with child .
After drink from those fountain of still fresh existence , we shall return into the crowd , a I do now , to struggle onward and do our part in life , perhaps as fervently a ever , but , for a time , with a kinder and purer heart , and a spirit more lightly wise .
_BOOK_TITLE_ : Nathaniel_Hawthorne___Snow_Flakes_ ( From_ '' Twice_Told_Tales '' ) .txt.out
There be snow in yonder cold gray sky of the morning !
- and , through the partially frost window-panes , I love to watch the gradual beginning of the storm .
A few feathery flake be scatter widely through the air , and hover downward with uncertain flight , now almost alight on the earth , now whirl again aloft into remote region of the atmosphere .
These be not the big flake , heavy with moisture , which melt a they touch the ground , and be portentous of a soaking rain .
It be to be , in good earnest , a wintry storm .
The two or three people , visible on the side-walks , have an aspect of endurance , a blue-nosed , frosty fortitude , which be evidently assume in anticipation of a comfortless and blustering day .
By nightfall , or at least before the sun shed another glimmer smile upon u , the street and our little garden will be heap with mountain snow-drifts .
The soil , already frozen for week past , be prepare to sustain whatever burden may be lay upon it ; and , to a northern eye , the landscape will lose it melancholy bleakness and acquire a beauty of it own , when Mother Earth , like her child , shall have put on the fleecy garb of her winter 's wear .
The cloud-spirits be slowly weave her white mantle .
As yet , indeed , there be barely a rime like hoarfrost over the brown surface of the street ; the withered green of the grass-plat be still discernible ; and the slated roof of the house do but begin to look gray , instead of black .
All the snow that have yet fall within the circumference of my view , be it heap up together , would hardly equal the hillock of a grave .
Thus gradually , by silent and stealthy influence , be great change work .
These little snow-particles , which the storm-spirit fling by handful through the air , will bury the great earth under their accumulated mass , nor permit her to behold her sister sky again for dreary month .
We , likewise , shall lose sight of our mother 's familiar visage , and must content ourselves with look heavenward the oftener .
Now , leave the storm to do his appoint office , let u sit down , pen in hand , by our fireside .
Gloomy a it may seem , there be an influence productive of cheerfulness , and favorable to imaginative thought , in the atmosphere of a snowy day .
The native of a southern clime may woo the muse beneath the heavy shade of summer foliage , recline on bank of turf , while the sound of sing bird and warble rivulet chime in with the music of his soul .
In our brief summer , I do not think , but only exist in the vague enjoyment of a dream .
My hour of inspiration -- if that hour ever come -- be when the green log hiss upon the hearth , and the bright flame , brighter for the gloom of the chamber , rustle high up the chimney , and the coal drop tinkle down among the grow heap of ash .
When the casement rattle in the gust , and the snow-flakes or the sleety raindrops pelt hard against the window-panes , then I spread out my sheet of paper , with the certainty that thought and fancy will gleam forth upon it , like star at twilight , or like violet in May , -- perhaps to fade a soon .
However transitory their glow , they at least shine amid the darksome shadow which the cloud of the outward sky fling through the room .
Blessed , therefore , and reverently welcome by me , her true-born son , be New England 's winter , which make u , one and all , the nursling of the storm , and sing a familiar lullaby even in the wild shriek of the December blast .
Now look we forth again , and see how much of his task the storm-spirit have do .
Slow and sure !
He have the day , perchance the week , before him , and may take his own time to accomplish Nature 's burial in snow .
A smooth mantle be scarcely yet throw over the withered grass-plat , and the dry stalk of annual still thrust themselves through the white surface in all part of the garden .
The leafless rose-bushes stand shiver in a shallow snow-drift , look , poor thing !
as disconsolate a if they possess a human consciousness of the dreary scene .
This be a sad time for the shrub that do not perish with the summer ; they neither live nor die ; what they retain of life seem but the chill sense of death .
Very sad be the flower shrub in midwinter !
The roof of the house be now all white , save where the eddying wind have keep them bare at the bleak corner .
To discern the real intensity of the storm , we must fix upon some distant object , -- a yonder spire , -and observe how the riotous gust fight with the descending snow throughout the intervening space .
Sometimes the entire prospect be obscure ; then , again , we have a distinct , but transient glimpse of the tall steeple , like a giant 's ghost ; and now the dense wreaths sweep between , a if demon be fling snowdrift at each other , in mid-air .
Look next into the street , where we have see an amuse parallel to the combat of those fancied demon in the upper region .
It be a snow-battle of school-boys .
What a pretty satire on war and military glory might be write , in the form of a child 's story , by describe the snowball-fights of two rival school , the alternate defeat and victory of each , and the final triumph of one party , or perhaps of neither !
What pitch battle , worthy to be chant in Homeric strain !
What storming of fortress , build all of massive snowblocks !
What feat of individual prowess , and embody onset of martial enthusiasm !
And when some well-contested and decisive victory have put a period to the war , both army should unite to build a lofty monument of snow upon the battle-field , and crown it with the victor 's statue , hewn of the same frozen marble .
In a few day or week thereafter , the passer-by would observe a shapeless mound upon the level common ; and , unmindful of the famous victory , would ask , `` How come it there ?
Who rear it ?
And what mean it ? ''
The shattered pedestal of many a battle monument have provoke these question , when none could answer .
Turn we again to the fireside , and sit musing there , lend our ear to the wind , till perhaps it shall seem like an articulate voice , and dictate wild and airy matter for the pen .
Would it might inspire me to sketch out the personification of a New England winter !
And that idea , if I can seize the snow-wreathed figure that flit before my fancy , shall be the theme of the next page .
How do Winter herald his approach ?
By the shriek blast of latter autumn , which be Nature 's cry of lamentation , a the destroyer rush among the shiver grove where she have linger , and scatter the sear leave upon the tempest .
When that cry be hear , the people wrap themselves in cloak , and shake their head disconsolately , say , `` Winter be at hand ! ''
Then the axe of the woodcutter echo sharp and diligently in the forest ; then the coal-merchants rejoice , because each shriek of Nature in her agony add something to the price of coal per ton ; then the peat-smoke spread it aromatic fragrance through the atmosphere .
A few day more ; and at eventide , the child look out of the window , and dimly perceive the flaunting of a snowy mantle in the air .
It be stern Winter 's vesture .
They crowd around the hearth , and cling to their mother 's gown , or press between their father 's knee , affright by the hollow roaring voice , that bellow a-down the wide flue of the chimney .
It be the voice of Winter ; and when parent and child bear it , they shudder and exclaim , `` Winter be come !
Cold Winter have begin his reign already ! ''
Now , throughout New England , each hearth become an altar , send up the smoke of a continued sacrifice to the immitigable deity who tyrannize over forest , country side , and town .
Wrapped in his white mantle , his staff a huge icicle , his beard and hair a wind-tossed snow-drift , he travel over the land , in the midst of the northern blast ; and woe to the homeless wanderer whom he find upon his path !
There he lie stark and stiff , a human shape of ice , on the spot where Winter overtake him .
On stride the tyrant over the rush river and broad lake , which turn to rock beneath his footstep .
His dreary empire be establish ; all around stretch the desolation of the Pole .
Yet not ungrateful be his New England child , -- for Winter be our sire , though a stern and rough one , -- not ungrateful even for the severity , which have nourish our unyielding strength of character .
And let u thank him , too , for the sleigh-rides , cheer by the music of merry bell ; for the crackling and rustle hearth , when the ruddy firelight gleam on hardy Manhood and the bloom cheek of Woman ; for all the home enjoyment , and the kindred virtue , which flourish in a frozen soil .
Not that we grieve , when , after some seven month of storm and bitter frost , Spring , in the guise of a flower-crowned virgin , be see drive away the hoary despot , pelt him with violet by the handful , and strew green grass on the path behind him .
Often , ere he will give up his empire , old Winter rush fiercely back , and hurl a snow-drift at the shrink form of Spring ; yet , step by step , he be compel to retreat northward , and spend the summer month within the Arctic circle .
Such fantasy , intermix among graver toil of mind , have make the winter 's day pas pleasantly .
Meanwhile , the storm have rag without abatement , and now , a the brief afternoon decline , be toss denser volume to and fro about the atmosphere .
On the window-sill , there be a layer of snow , reach half-way up the low pane of glass .
The garden be one unbroken bed .
Along the street be two or three spot of uncovered earth , where the gust have whirl away the snow , heap it elsewhere to the fence-tops , or pile huge bank against the door of house .
A solitary passenger be see , now stride mid-leg deep across a drift , now scud over the bare ground , while his cloak be swell with the wind .
And now the jingling of bell , a sluggish sound , responsive to the horse 's toilsome progress through the unbroken drift , announce the passage of a sleigh , with a boy cling behind , and duck his head to escape detection by the driver .
Next come a sledge , laden with wood for some unthrifty housekeeper , whom winter have surprise at a cold hearth .
But what dismal equipage now struggle along the uneven street ?
A sable hearse , bestrewn with snow , be bear a dead man through the storm to his frozen bed .
O , how dreary be a burial in winter , when the bosom of Mother Earth have no warmth for her poor child !
Evening -- the early eve of December -- begin to spread it deepen veil over the comfortless scene ; the firelight gradually brighten , and throw my flickering shadow upon the wall and ceiling of the chamber ; but still the storm rage and rattle , against the window .
Alas !
I shiver , and think it time to be disconsolate .
But , take a farewell glance at dead Nature in her shroud , I perceive a flock of snow-birds , skim lightsomely through the tempest , and flit from drift to drift , as sportively a swallow in the delightful prime of summer .
Whence come they ?
Where do they build their nest , and seek their food ?
Why , have airy wing , do they not follow summer around the earth , instead of make themselves the playmate of the storm , and flutter on the dreary verge of the winter 's eve ?
_BOOK_TITLE_ : Nathaniel_Hawthorne___Sunday_at_Home_ ( From_ '' Twice_Told_Tales '' ) .txt.out
Every Sabbath morning in the summer time I thrust back the curtain , to watch the sunrise steal down a steeple , which stand opposite my chamber-window .
First , the weathercock begin to flash ; then , a fainter lustre give the spire an airy aspect ; next it encroach on the tower , and cause the index of the dial to glisten like gold , a it point to the gilded figure of the hour .
Now , the lofty window gleam , and now the low .
The carved framework of the portal be mark strongly out .
At length , the morning glory , in it descent from heaven , come down the stone step , one by one ; and there stand the steeple , glow with fresh radiance , while the shade of twilight still hide themselves among the nook of the adjacent building .
Methinks , though the same sun brightens it every fair morning , yet the steeple have a peculiar robe of brightness for the Sabbath .
By dwell near a church , a person soon contract an attachment for the edifice .
We naturally personify it , and conceive it massive wall and it dim emptiness to be instinct with a calm , and meditative , and somewhat melancholy spirit .
But the steeple stand foremost , in our thought , as well a locally .
It impress u a a giant , with a mind comprehensive and discriminate enough to care for the great and small concern of all the town .
Hourly , while it speak a moral to the few that think , it remind thousand of busy individual of their separate and most secret affair .
It be the steeple , too , that fling abroad the hurried and irregular accent of general alarm ; neither have gladness and festivity find a good utterance , than by it tongue ; and when the dead be slowly pass to their home , the steeple have a melancholy voice to bid them welcome .
Yet , in spite of this connection with human interest , what a moral loneliness , on week-days , brood round about it stately height !
It have no kindred with the house above which it tower ; it look down into the narrow thoroughfare , the lonelier , because the crowd be elbow their passage at it base .
A glance at the body of the church deepen this impression .
Within , by the light of distant window , amid refracted shadow , we discern the vacant pew and empty gallery , the silent organ , the voiceless pulpit , and the clock , which tell to solitude how time be pass .
Time , -- where man live not , -- what be it but eternity ?
And in the church , we might suppose , be garner up , throughout the week , all thought and feeling that have reference to eternity , until the holy day come round again , to let them forth .
Might not , then , it more appropriate site be in the outskirt of the town , with space for old tree to wave around it , and throw their solemn shadow over a quiet green ?
We will say more of this , hereafter .
But , on the Sabbath , I watch the early sunshine , and fancy that a holy brightness mark the day , when there shall be no buzz of voice on the exchange , nor traffic in the shop , nor crowd , nor business , anywhere but at church .
Many have fancy so .
For my own part , whether I see it scatter down among tangled wood , or beam broad across the field , or hem in between brick building , or trace out the figure of the casement on my chamber-floor , still I recognize the Sabbath sunshine .
And ever let me recognize it !
Some illusion , and this among them , be the shadow of great truth .
Doubts may flit around me , or seem to close their evil wing , and settle down ; but so long a I imagine that the earth be hallow , and the light of heaven retain it sanctity , on the Sabbath , -- while that bless sunshine life within me , -- never can my soul have lose the instinct of it faith .
If it have go astray , it will return again .
I love to spend such pleasant Sabbaths , from morning till night , behind the curtain of my open window .
Are they spend amiss ?
Every spot , so near the church a to be visit by the circle shadow of the steeple , should be deem consecrated ground , to-day .
With strong truth be it say , that a devout heart may consecrate a den of thief , a an evil one may convert a temple to the same .
My heart , perhaps , have not such holy , nor , I would fain trust , such impious potency .
It must suffice , that , though my form be absent , my inner man go constantly to church , while many , whose bodily presence fill the accustomed seat , have leave their soul at home .
But I be there , even before my friend , the sexton .
At length , he come , -- a man of kindly , but sombre aspect , in dark gray clothes , and hair of the same mixture , -- he come and apply his key to the wide portal .
Now my thought may go in among the dusty pew , or ascend the pulpit without sacrilege , but soon come forth again to enjoy the music of the bell .
How glad , yet solemn too !
All the steeple in town be talk together , aloft in the sunny air , and rejoice among themselves , while their spire point heavenward .
Meantime , here be the child assemble to the Sabbath school , which be keep somewhere within the church .
Often , while look at the arched portal , I have be gladden by the sight of a score of these little girl and boy , in pink , blue , yellow , and crimson frock , burst suddenly forth into the sunshine , like a swarm of gay butterfly that have be shut up in the solemn gloom .
Or I might compare them to cherubs , haunt that holy place .
About a quarter of an hour before the second ringing of the bell , individual of the congregation begin to appear .
The early be invariably an old woman in black , whose bent frame and rounded shoulder be evidently lade with some heavy affliction , which she be eager to rest upon the altar .
Would that the Sabbath come twice as often , for the sake of that sorrowful old soul !
There be an elderly man , also , who arrive in good season , and lean against the corner of the tower , just within the line of it shadow , look downward with a darksome brow .
I sometimes fancy that the old woman be the happier of the two .
After these , others drop in singly , and by two and three , either disappear through the doorway or take their stand in it vicinity .
At last , and always with an unexpected sensation , the bell turn in the steeple overhead , and throw out an irregular clangor , jar the tower to it foundation .
As if there be magic in the sound , the sidewalk of the street , both up and down along , be immediately throng with two long line of people , all converge hitherward , and stream into the church .
Perhaps the far-off roar of a coach draw nearer , -- a deep thunder by it contrast with the surround stillness , -- until it set down the wealthy worshipper at the portal , among their humble brother .
Beyond that entrance , in theory at least , there be no distinction of earthly rank ; nor indeed , by the goodly apparel which be flaunt in the sun , would there seem to be such , on the hither side .
Those pretty girl !
Why will they disturb my pious meditation !
Of all day in the week , they should strive to look least fascinate on the Sabbath , instead of heighten their mortal loveliness , a if to rival the blessed angel , and keep our thought from heaven .
Were I the minister himself , I must need look .
One girl be white muslin from the waist upwards , and black silk downwards to her slipper ; a second blush from topknot to shoe-tie , one universal scarlet ; another shine of a pervading yellow , a if she have make a garment of the sunshine .
The great part , however , have adopt a milder cheerfulness of hue .
Their veil , especially when the wind raise them , give a lightness to the general effect , and make them appear like airy phantom , a they flit up the step , and vanish into the sombre doorway .
Nearly all -- though it be very strange that I should know it -- wear white stocking , white a snow , and neat slipper , lace crosswise with black ribbon , pretty high above the ankle .
A white stocking be infinitely more effective than a black one .
Here come the clergyman , slow and solemn , in severe simplicity , need no black silk gown to denote his office .
His aspect claim my reverence , but can not win my love .
Were I to picture Saint Peter , keep fast the gate of heaven , and frowning , more stern than pitiful , on the wretched applicant , that face should be my study .
By middle age , or sooner , the creed have generally work upon the heart , or be a-tempered by it .
As the minister pass into the church , the bell hold it iron tongue , and all the low murmur of the congregation die away .
The gray sexton look up and down the street , and then at my window-curtain , where , through the small peephole , I half fancy that he have catch my eye .
Now , every loiterer have go in , and the street lie asleep in the quiet sun , while a feeling of loneliness come over me , and bring also an uneasy sense of neglected privilege and duty .
O , I ought to have go to church !
The hustle of the rise congregation reach my ear .
They be stand up to pray .
Could I bring my heart into unison with those who be pray in yonder church , and lift it heavenward , with a fervor of supplication , but no distinct request , would not that be the safe kind of prayer ?
`` Lord , look down upon me in mercy ! ''
With that sentiment gush from my soul , might I not leave all the rest to Him ?
Hark !
the hymn .
This , at least , be a portion of the service which I can enjoy good than if I sit within the wall , where the full choir and the massive melody of the organ , would fall with a weight upon me .
At this distance , it thrill through my frame , and play upon my heartstrings , with a pleasure both of the sense and spirit .
Heaven be praise , I know nothing of music , a a science ; and the most elaborate harmony , if they please me , please as simply a a nurse 's lullaby .
The strain have cease , but prolongs itself in my mind , with fanciful echo , till I start from my revery , and find that the sermon have commence .
It be my misfortune seldom to fructify , in a regular way , by any but printed sermon .
The first strong idea , which the preacher utters , give birth to a train of thought , and lead me onward , step by step , quite out of hearing of the good man 's voice , unless he be indeed a son of thunder .
At my open window , catch now and then a sentence of the `` parson 's saw , '' I be as well situate a at the foot of the pulpit stair .
The broken and scatter fragment of this one discourse will be the text of many sermon , preach by those colleague pastor , -- colleague , but often disputant , -- my Mind and Heart .
The former pretend to be a scholar , and perplexes me with doctrinal point ; the latter take me on the score of feeling ; and both , like several other preacher , spend their strength to very little purpose .
I , their sole auditor , can not always understand them .
Suppose that a few hour have pass , and behold me still behind my curtain , just before the close of the afternoon service .
The hour-hand on the dial have pass beyond four o'clock .
The decline sun be hide behind the steeple , and throw it shadow straight across the street , so that my chamber be darken , a with a cloud .
Around the church-door all be solitude , and an impenetrable obscurity beyond the threshold .
A commotion be hear .
The seat be slam down , and the pew-doors throw back , -- a multitude of foot be trample along the unseen aisle , -- and the congregation burst suddenly through the portal .
Foremost , scamper a rabble of boy , behind whom move a dense and dark phalanx of grown men , and lastly , a crowd of female , with young child , and a few scattered husband .
This instantaneous outbreak of life into loneliness be one of the pleasant scene of the day .
Some of the good people be rub their eye , thereby intimate that they have be wrap , a it be , in a sort of holy trance , by the fervor of their devotion .
There be a young man , a third-rate coxcomb , whose first care be always to flourish a white handkerchief , and brush the seat of a tight pair of black silk pantaloon , which shine a if varnish .
They must have be make of the stuff call `` everlasting , '' or perhaps of the same piece a Christian 's garment in the Pilgrim 's Progress , for he put them on two summer ago , and have not yet wear the gloss off .
I have take a great liking to those black silk pantaloon .
But , now , with nod and greeting among friend , each matron take her husband 's arm , and pace gravely homeward , while the girl also flutter away , after arrange sunset walk with their favored bachelor .
The Sabbath eve be the eve of love .
At length , the whole congregation be disperse .
No ; here , with face as glossy a black satin , come two sable lady and a sable gentleman , and close in their rear the minister , who soften his severe visage , and bestow a kind word on each .
Poor soul !
To them the most captivating picture of bliss in heaven be -- `` There we shall be white ! ''
All be solitude again .
But , hark !
-- a broken warbling of voice , and now , attune it grandeur to their sweetness , a stately peal of the organ .
Who be the chorister ?
Let me dream that the angel , who come down from heaven , this bless morn , to blend themselves with the worship of the truly good , be play and sing their farewell to the earth .
On the wing of that rich melody they be borne upward .
This , gentle reader , be merely a flight of poetry .
A few of the sing men and sing woman have linger behind their fellow , and raise their voice fitfully , and blow a careless note upon the organ .
Yet , it lift my soul high than all their former strain .
They be go , the son and daughter of music , -- and the gray sexton be just close the portal .
For six day more , there will be no face of man in the pew , and aisle , and gallery , nor a voice in the pulpit , nor music in the choir .
Was it worth while to rear this massive edifice , to be a desert in the heart of the town , and populous only for a few hour of each seventh day ?
O , but the church be a symbol of religion !
May it site , which be consecrate on the day when the first tree be fell , be keep holy forever , a spot of solitude and peace , amid the trouble and vanity of our week-day world !
There be a moral , and a religion too , even in the silent wall .

THE WAYSIDE .
INTRODUCTORY .
A short time ago , I be favor with a fly visit from my young friend Eustace Bright , whom I have not before meet with since quit the breezy mountain of Berkshire .
It be the winter vacation at his college , Eustace be allow himself a little relaxation , in the hope , he tell me , of repair the inroad which severe application to study have make upon his health ; and I be happy to conclude , from the excellent physical condition in which I saw him , that the remedy have already be attend with very desirable success .
He have now run up from Boston by the noon train , partly impel by the friendly regard with which he be pleased to honor me , and partly , a I soon find , on a matter of literary business .
It delight me to receive Mr . Bright , for the first time , under a roof , though a very humble one , which I could really call my own .
Nor do I fail -LRB- a be the custom of landed proprietor all about the world -RRB- to parade the poor fellow up and down over my half a dozen acre ; secretly rejoice , nevertheless , that the disarray of the inclement season , and particularly the six inch of snow then upon the ground , prevent him from observe the ragged neglect of soil and shrubbery into which the place have lapse .
It be idle , however , to imagine that an airy guest from Monument Mountain , Bald Summit , and old Graylock , shaggy with primeval forest , could see anything to admire in my poor little hillside , with it growth of frail and insect-eaten locust tree .
Eustace very frankly call the view from my hill top tame ; and so , no doubt , it be , after rough , broken , rugged , headlong Berkshire , and especially the northern part of the county , with which his college residence have make him familiar .
But to me there be a peculiar , quiet charm in these broad meadow and gentle eminence .
They be good than mountain , because they do not stamp and stereotype themselves into the brain , and thus grow wearisome with the same strong impression , repeat day after day .
A few summer week among mountain , a lifetime among green meadow and placid slope , with outline forever new , because continually fade out of the memory -- such would be my sober choice .
I doubt whether Eustace do not internally pronounce the whole thing a bore , until I lead him to my predecessor 's little ruined , rustic summer house , midway on the hillside .
It be a mere skeleton of slender , decay tree trunk , with neither wall nor a roof ; nothing but a tracery of branch and twig , which the next wintry blast will be very likely to scatter in fragment along the terrace .
It look , and be , as evanescent a a dream ; and yet , in it rustic network of bough , it have somehow enclose a hint of spiritual beauty , and have become a true emblem of the subtile and ethereal mind that plan it .
I make Eustace Bright sit down on a snow bank , which have heap itself over the mossy seat , and gaze through the arched window opposite , he acknowledge that the scene at once grow picturesque .
`` Simple a it look , '' say he , `` this little edifice seem to be the work of magic .
It be full of suggestiveness , and , in it way , be as good a a cathedral .
Ah , it would be just the spot for one to sit in , of a summer afternoon , and tell the child some more of those wild story from the classic myth ! ''
`` It would , indeed , '' answer I . `` The summer house itself , so airy and so broken , be like one of those old tale , imperfectly remember ; and these live branch of the Baldwin apple tree , thrust so rudely in , be like your unwarrantable interpolation .
But , by the by , have you add any more legend to the series , since the publication of the ` Wonder-Book ' ? ''
`` Many more , '' say Eustace ; `` Primrose , Periwinkle , and the rest of them , allow me no comfort of my life unless I tell them a story every day or two .
I have run away from home partly to escape the importunity of these little wretch !
But I have write out six of the new story , and have bring them for you to look over . ''
`` Are they as good a the first ? ''
I inquire .
`` Better chosen , and good handle , '' reply Eustace Bright .
`` You will say so when you read them . ''
`` Possibly not , '' I remark .
`` I know from my own experience , that an author 's last work be always his best one , in his own estimate , until it quite lose the red heat of composition .
After that , it fall into it true place , quietly enough .
But let u adjourn to my study , and examine these new story .
It would hardly be do yourself justice , be you to bring me acquaint with them , sit here on this snow bank ! ''
So we descend the hill to my small , old cottage , and shut ourselves up in the south-eastern room , where the sunshine come in , warmly and brightly , through the good half of a winter 's day .
Eustace put his bundle of manuscript into my hand ; and I skim through it pretty rapidly , try to find out it merit and demerit by the touch of my finger , a a veteran story-teller ought to know how to do .
It will be remember that Mr . Bright condescend to avail himself of my literary experience by constitute me editor of the `` Wonder-Book . ''
As he have no reason to complain of the reception of that erudite work by the public , he be now dispose to retain me in a similar position with respect to the present volume , which he entitle TANGLEWOOD TALES .
Not , a Eustace hint , that there be any real necessity for my service a introducer , inasmuch a his own name have become establish in some good degree of favor with the literary world .
But the connection with myself , he be kind enough to say , have be highly agreeable ; nor be he by any mean desirous , a most people be , of kick away the ladder that have perhaps help him to reach his present elevation .
My young friend be willing , in short , that the fresh verdure of his grow reputation should spread over my straggling and half-naked bough ; even a I have sometimes think of train a vine , with it broad leafiness , and purple fruitage , over the worm-eaten post and rafter of the rustic summer house .
I be not insensible to the advantage of his proposal , and gladly assure him of my acceptance .
Merely from the title of the story I saw at once that the subject be not less rich than those of the former volume ; nor do I at all doubt that Mr . Bright 's audacity -LRB- so far a that endowment might avail -RRB- have enable him to take full advantage of whatever capability they offer .
Yet , in spite of my experience of his free way of handle them , I do not quite see , I confess , how he could have obviate all the difficulty in the way of render them presentable to child .
These old legend , so brim over with everything that be most abhorrent to our Christianized moral sense some of them so hideous , others so melancholy and miserable , amid which the Greek tragedian seek their theme , and mould them into the stern form of grief that ever the world saw ; be such material the stuff that child 's plaything should be make of !
How be they to be purify ?
How be the blessed sunshine to be throw into them ?
But Eustace tell me that these myth be the most singular thing in the world , and that he be invariably astonish , whenever he begin to relate one , by the readiness with which it adapt itself to the childish purity of his auditor .
The objectionable characteristic seem to be a parasitical growth , have no essential connection with the original fable .
They fall away , and be think of no more , the instant he put his imagination in sympathy with the innocent little circle , whose wide-open eye be fix so eagerly upon him .
Thus the story -LRB- not by any strained effort of the narrator 's , but in harmony with their inherent germ -RRB- transform themselves , and re-assume the shape which they might be suppose to possess in the pure childhood of the world .
When the first poet or romancer tell these marvellous legend -LRB- such be Eustace Bright 's opinion -RRB- , it be still the Golden Age .
Evil have never yet exist ; and sorrow , misfortune , crime , be mere shadow which the mind fancifully create for itself , a a shelter against too sunny reality ; or , at most , but prophetic dream to which the dreamer himself do not yield a waking credence .
Children be now the only representative of the men and woman of that happy era ; and therefore it be that we must raise the intellect and fancy to the level of childhood , in order to re-create the original myth .
I let the youthful author talk a much and as extravagantly a he please , and be glad to see him commence life with such confidence in himself and his performance .
A few year will do all that be necessary towards show him the truth in both respect .
Meanwhile , it be but right to say , he do really appear to have overcome the moral objection against these fable , although at the expense of such liberty with their structure a must be leave to plead their own excuse , without any help from me .
Indeed , except that there be a necessity for it -- and that the inner life of the legend can not be come at save by make them entirely one 's own property -- there be no defense to be make .
Eustace inform me that he have tell his story to the child in various situation -- in the wood , on the shore of the lake , in the dell of Shadow Brook , in the playroom , at Tanglewood fireside , and in a magnificent palace of snow , with ice window , which he help his little friend to build .
His auditor be even more delighted with the content of the present volume than with the specimen which have already be give to the world .
The classically learned Mr. Pringle , too , have listen to two or three of the tale , and censure them even more bitterly than he do THE THREE GOLDEN APPLES ; so that , what with praise , and what with criticism , Eustace Bright think that there be good hope of at least a much success with the public a in the case of the `` WonderBook . ''
I make all sort of inquiry about the child , not doubt that there would be great eagerness to hear of their welfare , among some good little folk who have write to me , to ask for another volume of myth .
They be all , I be happy to say -LRB- unless we except Clover -RRB- , in excellent health and spirit .
Primrose be now almost a young lady , and , Eustace tell me , be just as saucy a ever .
She pretend to consider herself quite beyond the age to be interested by such idle story a these ; but , for all that , whenever a story be to be tell , Primrose never fail to be one of the listener , and to make fun of it when finish .
Periwinkle be very much grown , and be expect to shut up her baby house and throw away her doll in a month or two more .
Sweet Fern have learn to read and write , and have put on a jacket and pair of pantaloon -- all of which improvement I be sorry for .
Squash Blossom , Blue Eye , Plantain , and Buttercup have have the scarlet fever , but come easily through it .
Huckleberry , Milkweed , and Dandelion be attack with the whooping cough , but bore it bravely , and keep out of door whenever the sun shone .
Cowslip , during the autumn , have either the measles , or some eruption that look very much like it , but be hardly sick a day .
Poor Clover have be a good deal troubled with her second teeth , which have make her meagre in aspect and rather fractious in temper ; nor , even when she smile , be the matter much mend , since it disclose a gap just within her lip , almost as wide a the barn door .
But all this will pass over , and it be predict that she will turn out a very pretty girl .
As for Mr . Bright himself , he be now in his senior year at Williams College , and have a prospect of graduate with some degree of honorable distinction at the next Commencement .
In his oration for the bachelor 's degree , he give me to understand , he will treat of the classical myth , view in the aspect of baby story , and have a great mind to discuss the expediency of use up the whole of ancient history , for the same purpose .
I do not know what he mean to do with himself after leave college , but trust that , by dabble so early with the dangerous and seductive business of authorship , he will not be tempt to become an author by profession .
If so I shall be very sorry for the little that I have have to do with the matter , in encourage these first beginning .
I wish there be any likelihood of my soon see Primrose , Periwinkle , Dandelion , Sweet Fern , Clover Plantain , Huckleberry , Milkweed , Cowslip , Buttercup , Blue Eye , and Squash Blossom again .
But a I do not know when I shall re-visit Tanglewood , and a Eustace Bright probably will not ask me to edit a third `` WonderBook , '' the public of little folk must not expect to hear any more about those dear child from me .
Heaven bless them , and everybody else , whether grown people or child !
THE MINOTAUR .
In the old city of Troezene , at the foot of a lofty mountain , there live , a very long time ago , a little boy name Theseus .
His grandfather , King Pittheus , be the sovereign of that country , and be reckon a very wise man ; so that Theseus , be bring up in the royal palace , and be naturally a bright lad , could hardly fail of profiting by the old king 's instruction .
His mother 's name be Aethra .
As for his father , the boy have never see him .
But , from his early remembrance , Aethra use to go with little Theseus into a wood , and sit down upon a moss-grown rock , which be deeply sink into the earth .
Here she often talk with her son about his father , and say that he be call Aegeus , and that he be a great king , and rule over Attica , and dwelt at Athens , which be a famous a city a any in the world .
Theseus be very fond of hear about King Aegeus , and often ask his good mother Aethra why he do not come and live with them at Troezene .
`` Ah , my dear son , '' answer Aethra , with a sigh , `` a monarch have his people to take care of .
The men and woman over whom he rule be in the place of child to him ; and he can seldom spare time to love his own child a other parent do .
Your father will never be able to leave his kingdom for the sake of see his little boy . ''
`` Well , but , dear mother , '' ask the boy , `` why can not I go to this famous city of Athens , and tell King Aegeus that I be his son ? ''
`` That may happen by and by , '' say Aethra .
`` Be patient , and we shall see .
You be not yet big and strong enough to set out on such an errand . ''
`` And how soon shall I be strong enough ? ''
Theseus persist in inquire .
`` You be but a tiny boy a yet , '' reply his mother .
`` See if you can lift this rock on which we be sit ? ''
The little fellow have a great opinion of his own strength .
So , grasp the rough protuberance of the rock , he tug and toil amain , and get himself quite out of breath , without be able to stir the heavy stone .
It seem to be root into the ground .
No wonder he could not move it ; for it would have take all the force of a very strong man to lift it out of it earthy bed .
His mother stand look on , with a sad kind of a smile on her lip and in her eye , to see the zealous and yet puny effort of her little boy .
She could not help be sorrowful at find him already so impatient to begin his adventure in the world .
`` You see how it be , my dear Theseus , '' say she .
`` You must possess far more strength than now before I can trust you to go to Athens , and tell King Aegeus that you be his son .
But when you can lift this rock , and show me what be hidden beneath it , I promise you my permission to depart . ''
Often and often , after this , do Theseus ask his mother whether it be yet time for him to go to Athens ; and still his mother point to the rock , and tell him that , for year to come , he could not be strong enough to move it .
And again and again the rosy-checked and curly-headed boy would tug and strain at the huge mass of stone , strive , child a he be , to do what a giant could hardly have do without take both of his great hand to the task .
Meanwhile the rock seem to be sink far and far into the ground .
The moss grow over it thicker and thicker , until at last it look almost like a soft green seat , with only a few gray knob of granite peep out .
The overhanging tree , also , shed their brown leave upon It , as often a the autumn come ; and at it base grow fern and wild flower , some of which creep quite over it surface .
To all appearance , the rock be a firmly fasten a any other portion of the earth 's substance .
But , difficult a the matter look , Theseus be now grow up to be such a vigorous youth , that , in his own opinion , the time would quickly come when he might hope to get the upper hand of this ponderous lump of stone .
`` Mother , I do believe it have start ! ''
cry he , after one of his attempt .
`` The earth around it be certainly a little cracked ! ''
`` No , no , child ! ''
his mother hastily answer .
`` It be not possible you can have move it , such a boy a you still be ! ''
Nor would she be convince , although Theseus show her the place where he fancy that the stem of a flower have be partly uproot by the movement of the rock .
But Aethra sigh , and look disquiet ; for , no doubt , she begin to be conscious that her son be no long a child , and that , in a little while hence , she must send him forth among the peril and trouble of the world .
It be not more than a year afterwards when they be again sit on the moss-covered stone .
Aethra have once more tell him the oft-repeated story of his father , and how gladly he would receive Theseus at his stately palace , and how he would present him to his courtier and the people , and tell them that here be the heir of his dominion .
The eye of Theseus glow with enthusiasm , and he would hardly sit still to hear his mother speak .
`` Dear mother Aethra , '' he exclaim , `` I never felt half so strong a now !
I be no longer a child , nor a boy , nor a mere youth !
I feel myself a man !
It be now time to make one earnest trial to remove the stone . ''
`` Ah , my dear Theseus , '' reply his mother `` not yet !
not yet ! ''
`` Yes , mother , '' say he , resolutely , `` the time have come ! ''
Then Theseus bent himself in good earnest to the task , and strain every sinew , with manly strength and resolution .
He put his whole brave heart into the effort .
He wrestle with the big and sluggish stone , a if it have be a living enemy .
He heave , he lift , he resolve now to succeed , or else to perish there , and let the rock be his monument forever !
Aethra stand gaze at him , and clasp her hand , partly with a mother 's pride , and partly with a mother 's sorrow .
The great rock stir !
Yes , it be raise slowly from the bed moss and earth , uproot the shrub and flower along with it , and be turn upon it side .
Theseus have conquer !
While take breath , he look joyfully at his mother , and she smile upon him through her tear .
`` Yes , Theseus , '' she say , `` the time have come , and you must stay no longer at my side !
See what King Aegeus , your royal father , leave for you beneath the stone , when he lift it in his mighty arm , and lay it on the spot whence you have now remove it . ''
Theseus look , and saw that the rock have be place over another slab of stone , contain a cavity within it ; so that it somewhat resemble a roughly-made chest or coffer , of which the upper mass have serve a the lid .
Within the cavity lay a sword , with a golden hilt , and a pair of sandal .
`` That be your father 's sword , '' say Aethra , `` and those be his sandal .
When he go to be king of Athens , he bid me treat you a a child until you should prove yourself a man by lift this heavy stone .
That task be accomplish , you be to put on his sandal , in order to follow in your father 's footstep , and to gird on his sword , so that you may fight giant and dragon , a King Aegeus do in his youth . ''
`` I will set out for Athens this very day ! ''
cry Theseus .
But his mother persuade him to stay a day or two long , while she get ready some necessary article for his journey .
When his grandfather , the wise King Pittheus , hear that Theseus intend to present himself at his father 's palace , he earnestly advise him to get on board of a vessel , and go by sea ; because he might thus arrive within fifteen mile of Athens , without either fatigue or danger .
`` The road be very bad by land , '' quoth the venerable king ; `` and they be terribly infest with robber and monster .
A mere lad , like Theseus , be not fit to be trust on such a perilous journey , all by himself .
No , no ; let him go by sea . ''
But when Theseus heard of robber and monster , he prick up his ear , and be so much the more eager to take the road along which they be to be meet with .
On the third day , therefore , he bid a respectful farewell to his grandfather , thank him for all his kindness ; and , after affectionately embrace his mother , he set forth with a good many of her tear glisten on his cheek , and some , if the truth must be tell , that have gush out of his own eye .
But he let the sun and wind dry them , and walk stoutly on , play with the golden hilt of his sword , and take very manly stride in his father 's sandal .
I can not stop to tell you hardly any of the adventure that befall Theseus on the road to Athens .
It be enough to say , that he quite clear that part of the country of the robber about whom King Pittheus have be so much alarmed .
One of these bad people be name Procrustes ; and he be indeed a terrible fellow , and have an ugly way of make fun of the poor traveler who happen to fall into his clutch .
In his cavern he have a bed , on which , with great pretense of hospitality , he invite his guest to lie down ; but , if they happen to be short than the bed , this wicked villain stretch them out by main force ; or , if they be too tall , he lop off their head or foot , and laugh at what he have do , a an excellent joke .
Thus , however weary a man might be , he never like to lie in the bed of Procrustes .
Another of these robber , name Scinis , must likewise have be a very great scoundrel .
He be in the habit of fling his victim off a high cliff into the sea ; and , in order to give him exactly his desert , Theseus toss him off the very same place .
But if you will believe me , the sea would not pollute itself by receive such a bad person into it bosom ; neither would the earth , have once get rid of him , consent to take him back ; so that , between the cliff and the sea , Scinis stick fast in the air , which be force to bear the burden of his naughtiness .
After these memorable deed , Theseus heard of an enormous sow , which run wild , and be the terror of all the farmer round about ; and , a he do not consider himself above do any good thing that come in his way , he kill this monstrous creature , and give the carcass to the poor people for bacon .
The great sow have be an awful beast , while ramp about the wood and field , but be a pleasant object enough when cut up into joint , and smoke on I know not how many dinner table .
Thus , by the time he reach his journey 's end , Theseus have do many valiant feat with his father 's golden-hilted sword , and have gain the renown of be one of the brave young men of the day .
His fame travel fast than he do , and reach Athens before him .
As he enter the city , he hear the inhabitant talk at the street corner , and say that Hercules be brave , and Jason too , and Castor and Pollux likewise , but that Theseus , the son of their own king , would turn out as great a hero a the best of them .
Theseus take long stride on hear this , and fancy himself sure of a magnificent reception at his father 's court , since he come thither with Fame to blow her trumpet before him , and cry to King Aegeus , `` Behold your son ! ''
He little suspect , innocent youth that he be , that here , in this very Athens , where his father reign , a great danger await him than any which he have encounter on the road .
Yet this be the truth .
You must understand that the father of Theseus , though not very old in year , be almost wear out with the care of government , and have thus grow age before his time .
His nephew , not expect him to live a very great while , intend to get all the power of the kingdom into their own hand .
But when they hear that Theseus have arrive in Athens , and learn what a gallant young man he be , they saw that he would not be at all the kind of a person to let them steal away his father 's crown and scepter , which ought to be his own by right of inheritance .
Thus these bad-hearted nephew of King Aegeus , who be the own cousin of Theseus , at once become his enemy .
A still more dangerous enemy be Medea , the wicked enchantress ; for she be now the king 's wife , and want to give the kingdom to her son Medus , instead of let it be give to the son of Aethra , whom she hat .
It so happen that the king 's nephew meet Theseus , and find out who he be , just a he reach the entrance of the royal palace .
With all their evil design against him , they pretend to be their cousin 's best friend , and express great joy at make his acquaintance .
They propose to him that he should come into the king 's presence a a stranger , in order to try whether Aegeus would discover in the young man 's feature any likeness either to himself or his mother Aethra , and thus recognize him for a son .
Theseus consent ; for he fancy that his father would know him in a moment , by the love that be in his heart .
But , while he wait at the door , the nephew run and tell King Aegeus that a young man have arrive in Athens , who , to their certain knowledge , intend to put him to death , and get possession of his royal crown .
`` And he be now wait for admission to your majesty 's presence , '' add they .
`` Aha ! ''
cry the old king , on hear this .
`` Why , he must be a very wicked young fellow indeed !
Pray , what would you advise me to do with him ? ''
In reply to this question , the wicked Medea put in her word .
As I have already tell you , she be a famous enchantress .
According to some story , she be in the habit of boil old people in a large caldron , under pretense of make them young again ; but King Aegeus , I suppose , do not fancy such an uncomfortable way of grow young , or perhaps be content to be old , and therefore would never let himself be pop into the caldron .
If there be time to spare from more important matter , I should be glad to tell you of Medea 's fiery chariot , draw by winged dragon , in which the enchantress use often to take an airing among the cloud .
This chariot , in fact , be the vehicle that first bring her to Athens , where she have do nothing but mischief ever since her arrival .
But these and many other wonder must be leave untold ; and it be enough to say , that Medea , amongst a thousand other bad thing , know how to prepare a poison , that be instantly fatal to whomsoever might so much a touch it with his lip .
So , when the king ask what he should do with Theseus , this naughty woman have an answer ready at her tongue 's end .
`` Leave that to me , please your majesty , '' she reply .
`` Only admit this evil-minded young man to your presence , treat him civilly , and invite him to drink a goblet of wine .
Your majesty be well aware that I sometimes amuse myself by distil very powerful medicine .
Here be one of them in this small phial .
As to what it be make of , that be one of my secret of state .
Do but let me put a single drop into the goblet , and let the young man taste it ; and I will answer for it , he shall quite lay aside the bad design with which he come hither . ''
As she say this , Medea smile ; but , for all her smiling face , she mean nothing less than to poison the poor innocent Theseus , before his father 's eye .
And King Aegeus , like most other king , think any punishment mild enough for a person who be accuse of plot against his life .
He therefore make little or no objection to Medea 's scheme , and as soon a the poisonous wine be ready , give order that the young stranger should be admit into his presence .
The goblet be set on a table beside the king 's throne ; and a fly , mean just to sip a little from the brim , immediately tumble into it , dead .
Observing this , Medea look round at the nephew , and smile again .
When Theseus be usher into the royal apartment , the only object that he seem to behold be the white-bearded old king .
There he sit on his magnificent throne , a dazzle crown on his head , and a scepter in his hand .
His aspect be stately and majestic , although his year and infirmity weigh heavily upon him , a if each year be a lump of lead , and each infirmity a ponderous stone , and all be bundle up together , and lay upon his weary shoulder .
The tear both of joy and sorrow sprang into the young man 's eye ; for he think how sad it be to see his dear father so infirm , and how sweet it would be to support him with his own youthful strength , and to cheer him up with the alacrity of his love spirit .
When a son take a father into his warm heart it renew the old man 's youth in a good way than by the heat of Medea 's magic caldron .
And this be what Theseus resolve to do .
He could scarcely wait to see whether King Aegeus would recognize him , so eager be he to throw himself into his arm .
Advancing to the foot of the throne , he attempt to make a little speech , which he have be think about , a he come up the stair .
But he be almost choke by a great many tender feeling that gush out of his heart and swell into his throat , all struggle to find utterance together .
And therefore , unless he could have lay his full , over-brimming heart into the king 's hand , poor Theseus know not what to do or say .
The cunning Medea observe what be pass in the young man 's mind .
She be more wicked at that moment than ever she have be before ; for -LRB- and it make me tremble to tell you of it -RRB- she do her bad to turn all this unspeakable love with which Theseus be agitate to his own ruin and destruction .
`` Does your majesty see his confusion ? ''
she whisper in the king 's ear .
`` He be so conscious of guilt , that he tremble and can not speak .
The wretch live too long !
Quick !
offer him the wine ! ''
Now King Aegeus have be gaze earnestly at the young stranger , a he draw near the throne .
There be something , he know not what , either in his white brow , or in the fine expression of his mouth , or in his beautiful and tender eye , that make him indistinctly feel a if he have see this youth before ; a if , indeed , he have trot him on his knee when a baby , and have behold him grow to be a stalwart man , while he himself grow old .
But Medea guess how the king felt , and would not suffer him to yield to these natural sensibility ; although they be the voice of his deep heart , tell him as plainly a it could speak , that here be our dear son , and Aethra 's son , come to claim him for a father .
The enchantress again whisper in the king 's ear , and compel him , by her witchcraft , to see everything under a false aspect .
He make up his mind , therefore , to let Theseus drink off the poisoned wine .
`` Young man , '' say he , `` you be welcome !
I be proud to show hospitality to so heroic a youth .
Do me the favor to drink the content of this goblet .
It be brim over , a you see , with delicious wine , such a I bestow only on those who be worthy of it !
None be more worthy to quaff it than yourself ! ''
So say , King Aegeus take the golden goblet from the table , and be about to offer it to Theseus .
But , partly through his infirmity , and partly because it seem so sad a thing to take away this young man 's life .
however wicked he might be , and partly , no doubt , because his heart be wise than his head , and quake within him at the thought of what he be go to do -- for all these reason , the king 's hand tremble so much that a great deal of the wine slop over .
In order to strengthen his purpose , and fear l the whole of the precious poison should be waste , one of his nephew now whisper to him : `` Has your Majesty any doubt of this stranger 's guilt ?
This be the very sword with which he mean to slay you .
How sharp , and bright , and terrible it be !
Quick !
-- let him taste the wine ; or perhaps he may do the deed even yet . ''
At these word , Aegeus drive every thought and feel out of his breast , except the one idea of how justly the young man deserve to be put to death .
He sit erect on his throne , and hold out the goblet of wine with a steady hand , and bent on Theseus a frown of kingly severity ; for , after all , he have too noble a spirit to murder even a treacherous enemy with a deceitful smile upon his face .
`` Drink ! ''
say he , in the stern tone with which he be wont to condemn a criminal to be behead .
`` You have well deserve of me such wine a this ! ''
Theseus hold out his hand to take the wine .
But , before he touch it , King Aegeus tremble again .
His eye have fall on the gold-hilted sword that hung at the young man 's side .
He draw back the goblet .
`` That sword ! ''
he exclaim : `` how come you by it ? ''
`` It be my father 's sword , '' reply Theseus , with a tremulous voice .
`` These be his sandal .
My dear mother -LRB- her name be Aethra -RRB- tell me his story while I be yet a little child .
But it be only a month since I grow strong enough to lift the heavy stone , and take the sword and sandal from beneath it , and come to Athens to seek my father . ''
`` My son !
my son ! ''
cry King Aegeus , fling away the fatal goblet , and totter down from the throne to fall into the arm of Theseus .
`` Yes , these be Aethra 's eye .
It be my son . ''
I have quite forget what become of the king 's nephew .
But when the wicked Medea saw this new turn of affair , she hurry out of the room , and go to her private chamber , lose no time to set her enchantment to work .
In a few moment , she hear a great noise of hiss snake outside of the chamber window ; and behold !
there be her fiery chariot , and four huge wing serpent , wriggle and twist in the air , flourish their tail higher than the top of the palace , and all ready to set off on an aerial journey .
Medea staid only long enough to take her son with her , and to steal the crown jewel , together with the king 's best robe , and whatever other valuable thing she could lay hand on ; and get into the chariot , she whip up the snake , and ascend high over the city .
The king , hear the hiss of the serpent , scramble as fast a he could to the window , and bawl out to the abominable enchantress never to come back .
The whole people of Athens , too , who have run out of door to see this wonderful spectacle , set up a shout of joy at the prospect of get rid of her .
Medea , almost burst with rage , uttered precisely such a hiss a one of her own snake , only ten time more venomous and spiteful ; and glare fiercely out of the blaze of the chariot , she shake her hand over the multitude below , a if she be scatter a million of curse among them .
In so do , however , she unintentionally let fall about five hundred diamond of the first water , together with a thousand great pearl , and two thousand emerald , ruby , sapphire , opal , and topaz , to which she have help herself out of the king 's strong box .
All these come pelt down , like a shower of many-colored hailstone , upon the head of grown people and child , who forthwith gather them up , and carry them back to the palace .
But King Aegeus tell them that they be welcome to the whole , and to twice as many more , if he have them , for the sake of his delight at find his son , and lose the wicked Medea .
And , indeed , if you have see how hateful be her last look , a the flaming chariot fly upward , you would not have wonder that both king and people should think her departure a good riddance .
And now Prince Theseus be take into great favor by his royal father .
The old king be never weary of have him sit beside him on his throne -LRB- which be quite wide enough for two -RRB- , and of hear him tell about his dear mother , and his childhood , and his many boyish effort to lift the ponderous stone .
Theseus , however , be much too brave and active a young man to be willing to spend all his time in relate thing which have already happen .
His ambition be to perform other and more heroic deed , which should be good worth tell in prose and verse .
Nor have he be long in Athens before he catch and chain a terrible mad bull , and make a public show of him , greatly to the wonder and admiration of good King Aegeus and his subject .
But pretty soon , he undertake an affair that make all his foregone adventure seem like mere boy 's play .
The occasion of it be a follow : One morning , when Prince Theseus awake , he fancy that he must have have a very sorrowful dream , and that it be still run in his mind , even now that his eye be open .
For it appear a if the air be full of a melancholy wail ; and when he listen more attentively , he could hear sob , and groan , and scream of woe , mingle with deep , quiet sigh , which come from the king 's palace , and from the street , and from the temple , and from every habitation in the city .
And all these mournful noise , issue out of thousand of separate heart , united themselves into one great sound of affliction , which have startle Theseus from slumber .
He put on his clothes as quickly a he could -LRB- not forget his sandal and gold-hilted sword -RRB- , and , hasten to the king , inquire what it all meant .
`` Alas !
my son , '' quoth King Aegeus , heave a long sigh , `` here be a very lamentable matter in hand !
This be the wofulest anniversary in the whole year .
It be the day when we annually draw lot to see which of the youth and maid of Athens shall go to be devour by the horrible Minotaur ! ''
`` The Minotaur ! ''
exclaim Prince Theseus ; and like a brave young prince a he be , he put his hand to the hilt of his sword .
`` What kind of a monster may that be ?
Is it not possible , at the risk of one 's life , to slay him ? ''
But King Aegeus shake his venerable head , and to convince Theseus that it be quite a hopeless case , he give him an explanation of the whole affair .
It seem that in the island of Crete there live a certain dreadful monster , call a Minotaur , which be shape partly like a man and partly like a bull , and be altogether such a hideous sort of a creature that it be really disagreeable to think of him .
If he be suffer to exist at all , it should have be on some desert island , or in the duskiness of some deep cavern , where nobody would ever be torment by his abominable aspect .
But King Minos , who reign over Crete , lay out a vast deal of money in build a habitation for the Minotaur , and take great care of his health and comfort , merely for mischief 's sake .
A few year before this time , there have be a war between the city of Athens and the island of Crete , in which the Athenians be beat , and compel to beg for peace .
No peace could they obtain , however , except on condition that they should send seven young men and seven maiden , every year , to be devour by the pet monster of the cruel King Minos .
For three year past , this grievous calamity have be bear .
And the sob , and groan , and shriek , with which the city be now fill , be cause by the people 's woe , because the fatal day have come again , when the fourteen victim be to be choose by lot ; and the old people fear l their son or daughter might be take , and the youth and damsel dread l they themselves might be destine to glut the ravenous maw of that detestable man-brute .
But when Theseus hear the story , he straighten himself up , so that he seem taller than ever before ; and a for his face it be indignant , despiteful , bold , tender , and compassionate , all in one look .
`` Let the people of Athens this year draw lot for only six young men , instead of seven , '' say he , `` I will myself be the seventh ; and let the Minotaur devour me if he can ! ''
`` O my dear son , '' cry King Aegeus , `` why should you expose yourself to this horrible fate ?
You be a royal prince , and have a right to hold yourself above the destiny of common men . ''
`` It be because I be a prince , your son , and the rightful heir of your kingdom , that I freely take upon me the calamity of your subject , '' answer Theseus , `` And you , my father , be king over these people , and answerable to Heaven for their welfare , be bind to sacrifice what be dear to you , rather than that the son or daughter of the poor citizen should come to any harm . ''
The old king shed tear , and beseech Theseus not to leave him desolate in his old age , more especially a he have but just begin to know the happiness of possess a good and valiant son .
Theseus , however , felt that he be in the right , and therefore would not give up his resolution .
But he assure his father that he do not intend to be eat up , unresistingly , like a sheep , and that , if the Minotaur devour him , it should not be without a battle for his dinner .
And finally , since he could not help it , King Aegeus consent to let him go .
So a vessel be get ready , and rig with black sail ; and Theseus , with six other young men , and seven tender and beautiful damsel , come down to the harbor to embark .
A sorrowful multitude accompany them to the shore .
There be the poor old king , too , lean on his son 's arm , and look a if his single heart hold all the grief of Athens .
Just a Prince Theseus be go on board , his father bethink himself of one last word to say .
`` My beloved son , '' say he , grasp the Prince 's hand , `` you observe that the sail of this vessel be black ; a indeed they ought to be , since it go upon a voyage of sorrow and despair .
Now , be weigh down with infirmity , I know not whether I can survive till the vessel shall return .
But , as long a I do live , I shall creep daily to the top of yonder cliff , to watch if there be a sail upon the sea .
And , dear Theseus , if by some happy chance , you should escape the jaw of the Minotaur , then tear down those dismal sail , and hoist others that shall be bright a the sunshine .
Beholding them on the horizon , myself and all the people will know that you be come back victorious , and will welcome you with such a festal uproar a Athens never hear before . ''
Theseus promise that he would do so .
Then go on board , the mariner trim the vessel 's black sail to the wind , which blow faintly off the shore , be pretty much make up of the sigh that everybody keep pour forth on this melancholy occasion .
But by and by , when they have get fairly out to sea , there come a stiff breeze from the north-west , and drive them along a merrily over the white-capped wave a if they have be go on the most delightful errand imaginable .
And though it be a sad business enough , I rather question whether fourteen young people , without any old person to keep them in order , could continue to spend the whole time of the voyage in be miserable .
There have be some few dance upon the undulating deck , I suspect , and some hearty burst of laughter , and other such unseasonable merriment among the victim , before the high blue mountain of Crete begin to show themselves among the far-off cloud .
That sight , to be sure , make them all very grave again .
Theseus stand among the sailor , gaze eagerly towards the land ; although , a yet , it seem hardly more substantial than the cloud , amidst which the mountain be loom up .
Once or twice , he fancy that he saw a glare of some bright object , a long way off , fling a gleam across the wave .
`` Did you see that flash of light ? ''
he inquire of the master of the vessel .
`` No , prince ; but I have see it before , '' answer the master .
`` It come from Talus , I suppose . ''
As the breeze come fresher just then , the master be busy with trim his sail , and have no more time to answer question .
But while the vessel fly faster and faster towards Crete , Theseus be astonish to behold a human figure , gigantic in size , which appear to be stride , with a measured movement , along the margin of the island .
It step from cliff to cliff , and sometimes from one headland to another , while the sea foam and thunder on the shore beneath , and dash it jet of spray over the giant 's foot .
What be still more remarkable , whenever the sun shone on this huge figure , it flicker and glimmer ; it vast countenance , too , have a metallic lustre , and throw great flash of splendor through the air .
The fold of it garment , moreover , instead of wave in the wind , fell heavily over it limb , a if woven of some kind of metal .
The nigher the vessel come , the more Theseus wonder what this immense giant could be , and whether it actually have life or no .
For , though it walk , and make other lifelike motion , there yet be a kind of jerk in it gait , which , together with it brazen aspect , cause the young prince to suspect that it be no true giant , but only a wonderful piece of machinery .
The figure look all the more terrible because it carry an enormous brass club on it shoulder .
`` What be this wonder ? ''
Theseus ask of the master of the vessel , who be now at leisure to answer him .
`` It be Talus , the Man of Brass , '' say the master .
`` And be he a live giant , or a brazen image ? ''
ask Theseus .
`` That , truly , '' reply the master , `` be the point which have always perplex me .
Some say , indeed , that this Talus be hammer out for King Minos by Vulcan himself , the skilfullest of all worker in metal .
But who ever saw a brazen image that have sense enough to walk round an island three time a day , a this giant walk round the island of Crete , challenge every vessel that come nigh the shore ?
And , on the other hand , what live thing , unless his sinew be make of brass , would not be weary of march eighteen hundred mile in the twenty-four hour , a Talus do , without ever sit down to rest ?
He be a puzzler , take him how you will . ''
Still the vessel go bound onward ; and now Theseus could hear the brazen clangor of the giant 's footstep , a he tread heavily upon the sea-beaten rock , some of which be see to crack and crumble into the foam wave beneath his weight .
As they approach the entrance of the port , the giant straddle clear across it , with a foot firmly plant on each headland , and uplift his club to such a height that it butt-end be hide in the cloud , he stand in that formidable posture , with the sun gleam all over his metallic surface .
There seem nothing else to be expect but that , the next moment , he would fetch his great club down , slam bang , and smash the vessel into a thousand piece , without heed how many innocent people he might destroy ; for there be seldom any mercy in a giant , you know , and quite as little in a piece of brass clockwork .
But just when Theseus and his companion think the blow be come , the brazen lip unclosed themselves , and the figure speak .
`` Whence come you , stranger ? ''
And when the ringing voice cease , there be just such a reverberation a you may have hear within a great church bell , for a moment or two after the stroke of the hammer .
`` From Athens ! ''
shout the master in reply .
`` On what errand ? ''
thunder the Man of Brass .
And he whirl his club aloft more threateningly than ever , a if he be about to smite them with a thunderstroke right amidships , because Athens , so little while ago , have be at war with Crete .
`` We bring the seven youth and the seven maiden , '' answer the master , `` to be devour by the Minotaur ! ''
`` Pass ! ''
cry the brazen giant .
That one loud word roll all about the sky , while again there be a booming reverberation within the figure 's breast .
The vessel glide between the headland of the port , and the giant resume his march .
In a few moment , this wondrous sentinel be far away , flash in the distant sunshine , and revolve with immense stride round the island of Crete , a it be his never-ceasing task to do .
No sooner have they enter the harbor than a party of the guard of King Minos come down to the water side , and take charge of the fourteen young men and damsel .
Surrounded by these arm warrior , Prince Theseus and his companion be lead to the king 's palace , and usher into his presence .
Now , Minos be a stern and pitiless king .
If the figure that guard Crete be make of brass , then the monarch , who rule over it , might be think to have a still hard metal in his breast , and might have be call a man of iron .
He bend his shaggy brows upon the poor Athenian victim .
Any other mortal , behold their fresh and tender beauty , and their innocent look , would have felt himself sit on thorn until he have make every soul of them happy by bid them go free a the summer wind .
But this immitigable Minos care only to examine whether they be plump enough to satisfy the Minotaur 's appetite .
For my part , I wish he himself have be the only victim ; and the monster would have find him a pretty tough one .
One after another , King Minos call these pale , frighten youth and sob maiden to his footstool , give them each a poke in the rib with his sceptre -LRB- to try whether they be in good flesh or no -RRB- , and dismiss them with a nod to his guard .
But when his eye rest on Theseus , the king look at him more attentively , because his face be calm and brave .
`` Young man , '' ask he , with his stern voice , `` be you not appal at the certainty of be devour by this terrible Minotaur ? ''
`` I have offer my life in a good cause , '' answer Theseus , `` and therefore I give it freely and gladly .
But thou , King Minos , art thou not thyself appal , who , year after year , hast perpetrate this dreadful wrong , by give seven innocent youth and a many maiden to be devour by a monster ?
Dost thou not tremble , wicked king , to turn shine eye inward on shine own heart ?
Sitting there on thy golden throne , and in thy robe of majesty , I tell thee to thy face , King Minos , thou art a more hideous monster than the Minotaur himself ! ''
`` Aha !
do you think me so ? ''
cry the king , laugh in his cruel way .
`` To-morrow , at breakfast time , you shall have an opportunity of judge which be the great monster , the Minotaur or the king !
Take them away , guard ; and let this free-spoken youth be the Minotaur 's first morsel . ''
Near the king 's throne -LRB- though I have no time to tell you so before -RRB- stand his daughter Ariadne .
She be a beautiful and tender-hearted maiden , and look at these poor doom captive with very different feeling from those of the iron-breasted King Minos .
She really weep indeed , at the idea of how much human happiness would be needlessly throw away , by give so many young people , in the first bloom and rise blossom of their life , to be eat up by a creature who , no doubt , would have prefer a fat ox , or even a large pig , to the plumpest of them .
And when she behold the brave , spirited figure of Prince Theseus bear himself so calmly in his terrible peril , she grow a hundred time more pitiful than before .
As the guard be take him away , she fling herself at the king 's foot , and beseech him to set all the captive free , and especially this one young man .
`` Peace , foolish girl ! ''
answer King Minos .
`` What hast thou to do with an affair like this ?
It be a matter of state policy , and therefore quite beyond thy weak comprehension .
Go water thy flower , and think no more of these Athenian caitiff , whom the Minotaur shall a certainly eat up for breakfast a I will eat a partridge for my supper . ''
So say , the king look cruel enough to devour Theseus and all the rest of the captive himself , have there be no Minotaur to save him the trouble .
As he would hear not another word in their favor , the prisoner be now lead away , and clap into a dungeon , where the jailer advise them to go to sleep as soon a possible , because the Minotaur be in the habit of call for breakfast early .
The seven maiden and six of the young men soon sob themselves to slumber .
But Theseus be not like them .
He felt conscious that he be wiser , and braver , and strong than his companion , and that therefore he have the responsibility of all their life upon him , and must consider whether there be no way to save them , even in this last extremity .
So he keep himself awake , and pace to and fro across the gloomy dungeon in which they be shut up .
Just before midnight , the door be softly unbarred , and the gentle Ariadne show herself , with a torch in her hand .
`` Are you awake , Prince Theseus ? ''
she whisper .
`` Yes , '' answer Theseus .
`` With so little time to live , I do not choose to waste any of it in sleep . ''
`` Then follow me , '' say Ariadne , `` and tread softly . ''
What have become of the jailer and the guard , Theseus never know .
But , however that might be , Ariadne open all the door , and lead him forth from the darksome prison into the pleasant moonlight .
`` Theseus , '' say the maiden , `` you can now get on board your vessel , and sail away for Athens . ''
`` No , '' answer the young man ; `` I will never leave Crete unless I can first slay the Minotaur , and save my poor companion , and deliver Athens from this cruel tribute . ''
`` I know that this would be your resolution , '' say Ariadne .
`` Come , then , with me , brave Theseus .
Here be your own sword , which the guard deprive you of .
You will need it ; and pray Heaven you may use it well . ''
Then she lead Theseus along by the hand until they come to a dark , shadowy grove , where the moonlight waste itself on the top of the tree , without shed hardly so much a a glimmering beam upon their pathway .
After go a good way through this obscurity , they reach a high marble wall , which be overgrow with creep plant , that make it shaggy with their verdure .
The wall seem to have no door , nor any window , but rise up , lofty , and massive , and mysterious , and be neither to be clamber over , nor , as far a Theseus could perceive , to be pass through .
Nevertheless , Ariadne do but press one of her soft little finger against a particular block of marble and , though it look as solid a any other part of the wall , it yield to her touch , disclose an entrance just wide enough to admit them They creep through , and the marble stone swung back into it place .
`` We be now , '' say Ariadne , `` in the famous labyrinth which Daedalus build before he make himself a pair of wing , and fly away from our island like a bird .
That Daedalus be a very cunning workman ; but of all his artful contrivance , this labyrinth be the most wondrous .
Were we to take but a few step from the doorway , we might wander about all our lifetime , and never find it again .
Yet in the very center of this labyrinth be the Minotaur ; and , Theseus , you must go thither to seek him . ''
`` But how shall I ever find him , '' ask Theseus , `` if the labyrinth so bewilders me a you say it will ? ''
Just a he speak , they hear a rough and very disagreeable roar , which greatly resemble the lowing of a fierce bull , but yet have some sort of sound like the human voice .
Theseus even fancy a rude articulation in it , a if the creature that utter it be try to shape his hoarse breath into word .
It be at some distance , however , and he really could not tell whether it sound most like a bull 's roar or a man 's harsh voice .
`` That be the Minotaur 's noise , '' whisper Ariadne , closely grasp the hand of Theseus , and press one of her own hand to her heart , which be all in a tremble .
`` You must follow that sound through the winding of the labyrinth , and , by and by , you will find him .
Stay !
take the end of this silken string ; I will hold the other end ; and then , if you win the victory , it will lead you again to this spot .
Farewell , brave Theseus . ''
So the young man take the end of the silken string in his left hand , and his gold-hilted sword , ready drawn from it scabbard , in the other , and tread boldly into the inscrutable labyrinth .
How this labyrinth be build be more than I can tell you .
But so cunningly contrive a mizmaze be never see in the world , before nor since .
There can be nothing else so intricate , unless it be the brain of a man like Daedalus , who plan it , or the heart of any ordinary man ; which last , to be sure , be ten time a great a mystery a the labyrinth of Crete .
Theseus have not take five step before he lose sight of Ariadne ; and in five more his head be grow dizzy .
But still he go on , now creep through a low arch , now ascend a flight of step , now in one crooked passage and now in another , with here a door open before him , and there one banging behind , until it really seem a if the wall spin round , and whirl him round along with them .
And all the while , through these hollow avenue , now nearer , now farther off again , resound the cry of the Minotaur ; and the sound be so fierce , so cruel , so ugly , so like a bull 's roar , and withal so like a human voice , and yet like neither of them , that the brave heart of Theseus grow sterner and angrier at every step ; for he felt it an insult to the moon and sky , and to our affectionate and simple Mother Earth , that such a monster should have the audacity to exist .
As he pass onward , the cloud gather over the moon , and the labyrinth grow so dusky that Theseus could no longer discern the bewilderment through which he be pass .
He would have leave quite lose , and utterly hopeless of ever again walk in a straight path , if , every little while , he have not be conscious of a gentle twitch at the silken cord .
Then he know that the tender-hearted Ariadne be still hold the other end , and that she be fear for him , and hop for him , and give him just a much of her sympathy a if she be close by his side .
O , indeed , I can assure you , there be a vast deal of human sympathy run along that slender thread of silk .
But still he follow the dreadful roar of the Minotaur , which now grow louder and louder , and finally so very loud that Theseus fully expect to come close upon him , at every new zizgag and wriggle of the path .
And at last , in an open space , at the very center of the labyrinth , he do discern the hideous creature .
Sure enough , what an ugly monster it be !
Only his horn head belong to a bull ; and yet , somehow or other , he look like a bull all over , preposterously waddle on his hind leg ; or , if you happen to view him in another way , he seem wholly a man , and all the more monstrous for be so .
And there he be , the wretched thing , with no society , no companion , no kind of a mate , live only to do mischief , and incapable of know what affection mean .
Theseus hat him , and shudder at him , and yet could not but be sensible of some sort of pity ; and all the more , the ugly and more detestable the creature be .
For he keep stride to and fro , in a solitary frenzy of rage , continually emit a hoarse roar , which be oddly mixed up with half-shaped word ; and , after listen a while , Theseus understand that the Minotaur be say to himself how miserable he be , and how hungry , and how he hat everybody , and how he long to eat up the human race alive .
Ah !
the bull-headed villain !
And O , my good little people , you will perhaps see , one of these day , a I do now , that every human be who suffer any thing evil to get into his nature , or to remain there , be a kind of Minotaur , an enemy of his fellow-creatures , and separate from all good companionship , a this poor monster be .
Was Theseus afraid ?
By no mean , my dear auditor .
What !
a hero like Theseus afraid , Not have the Minotaur have twenty bull-heads instead of one .
Bold a he be , however , I rather fancy that it strengthen his valiant heart , just at this crisis , to feel a tremulous twitch at the silken cord , which he be still hold in his left hand .
It be a if Ariadne be give him all her might and courage ; and much a he already have , and little a she have to give , it make his own seem twice as much .
And to confess the honest truth , he need the whole ; for now the Minotaur , turn suddenly about , catch sight of Theseus , and instantly lower his horribly sharp horn , exactly a a mad bull do when he mean to rush against an enemy .
At the same time , he belch forth a tremendous roar , in which there be something like the word of human language , but all disjoint and shake to piece by pass through the gullet of a miserably enrage brute .
Theseus could only guess what the creature intend to say , and that rather by his gesture than his word ; for the Minotaur 's horn be sharp than his wit , and of a great deal more service to him than his tongue .
But probably this be the sense of what he utter : `` Ah , wretch of a human be !
I 'll stick my horn through you , and toss you fifty foot high , and eat you up the moment you come down . ''
`` Come on , then , and try it ! ''
be all that Theseus deign to reply ; for he be far too magnanimous to assault his enemy with insolent language .
Without more word on either side , there ensue the most awful fight between Theseus and the Minotaur that ever happen beneath the sun or moon .
I really know not how it might have turn out , if the monster , in his first headlong rush against Theseus , have not miss him , by a hair 's breadth , and break one of his horn short off against the stone wall .
On this mishap , he bellow so intolerably that a part of the labyrinth tumble down , and all the inhabitant of Crete mistake the noise for an uncommonly heavy thunder storm .
Smarting with the pain , he gallop around the open space in so ridiculous a way that Theseus laugh at it , long afterwards , though not precisely at the moment .
After this , the two antagonist stand valiantly up to one another , and fought , sword to horn , for a long while .
At last , the Minotaur make a run at Theseus , graze his left side with his horn , and fling him down ; and think that he have stab him to the heart , he cut a great caper in the air , open his bull mouth from ear to ear , and prepare to snap his head off .
But Theseus by this time have leap up , and catch the monster off his guard .
Fetching a sword stroke at him with all his force , he hit him fair upon the neck , and make his bull head skip six yard from his human body , which fell down flat upon the ground .
So now the battle be end .
Immediately the moon shone out as brightly a if all the trouble of the world , and all the wickedness and the ugliness that infest human life , be past and go forever .
And Theseus , a he lean on his sword , take breath , felt another twitch of the silken cord ; for all through the terrible encounter , he have hold it fast in his left hand .
Eager to let Ariadne know of his success , he follow the guidance of the thread , and soon find himself at the entrance of the labyrinth .
`` Thou hast slay the monster , '' cry Ariadne , clasp her hand .
`` Thanks to thee , dear Ariadne , '' answer Theseus , `` I return victorious . ''
`` Then , '' say Ariadne , `` we must quickly summon thy friend , and get them and thyself on board the vessel before dawn .
If morning find thee here , my father will avenge the Minotaur . ''
To make my story short , the poor captive be awaken , and , hardly know whether it be not a joyful dream , be tell of what Theseus have do , and that they must set sail for Athens before daybreak .
Hastening down to the vessel , they all clamber on board , except Prince Theseus , who linger behind them on the strand , hold Ariadne 's hand clasp in his own .
`` Dear maiden , '' say he , `` thou wilt surely go with u .
Thou art too gentle and sweet a child for such an iron-hearted father a King Minos .
He care no more for thee than a granite rock care for the little flower that grow in one of it crevice .
But my father , King Aegeus , and my dear mother , Aethra , and all the father and mother in Athens , and all the son and daughter too , will love and honor thee a their benefactress .
Come with u , then ; for King Minos will be very angry when he know what thou hast do . ''
Now , some low-minded people , who pretend to tell the story of Theseus and Ariadne , have the face to say that this royal and honorable maiden do really flee away , under cover of the night , with the young stranger whose life she have preserve .
They say , too , that Prince Theseus -LRB- who would have die sooner than wrong the mean creature in the world -RRB- ungratefully desert Ariadne , on a solitary island , where the vessel touch on it voyage to Athens .
But , have the noble Theseus heard these falsehood , he would have serve their slanderous author a he serve the Minotaur !
Here be what Ariadne answer , when the brave prince of Athens beseech her to accompany him : `` No , Theseus , '' the maiden say , press his hand , and then draw back a step or two , `` I can not go with you .
My father be old , and have nobody but myself to love him .
Hard a you think his heart be , it would break to lose me .
At first , King Minos will be angry ; but he will soon forgive his only child ; and , by and by , he will rejoice , I know , that no more youth and maiden must come from Athens to be devour by the Minotaur .
I have save you , Theseus , a much for my father 's sake a for your own .
Farewell !
Heaven bless you ! ''
All this be so true , and so maiden-like , and be speak with so sweet a dignity , that Theseus would have blush to urge her any longer .
Nothing remain for him , therefore , but to bid Ariadne an affectionate farewell , and to go on board the vessel , and set sail .
In a few moment the white foam be boil up before their prow , a Prince Theseus and his companion sail out of the harbor , with a whistling breeze behind them .
Talus , the brazen giant , on his never-ceasing sentinel 's march , happen to be approach that part of the coast ; and they saw him , by the glimmering of the moonbeam on his polished surface , while he be yet a great way off .
As the figure move like clockwork , however , and could neither hasten his enormous stride nor retard them , he arrive at the port when they be just beyond the reach of his club .
Nevertheless , straddle from headland to headland , a his custom be , Talus attempt to strike a blow at the vessel , and , overreach himself , tumble at full length into the sea , which splash high over his gigantic shape , a when an iceberg turn a somerset .
There he lie yet ; and whoever desire to enrich himself by mean of brass have good go thither with a diving bell , and fish up Talus .
On the homeward voyage , the fourteen youth and damsel be in excellent spirit , a you will easily suppose .
They spend most of their time in dancing , unless when the sidelong breeze make the deck slope too much .
In due season , they come within sight of the coast of Attica , which be their native country .
But here , I be grieve to tell you , happen a sad misfortune .
You will remember -LRB- what Theseus unfortunately forget -RRB- that his father , King Aegeus , have enjoin it upon him to hoist sunshiny sail , instead of black one , in case he should overcome the Minotaur , and return victorious .
In the joy of their success , however , and amidst the sport , dancing , and other merriment , with which these young folk wear away the time , they never once think whether their sail be black , white , or rainbow color , and , indeed , leave it entirely to the mariner whether they have any sail at all .
Thus the vessel return , like a raven , with the same sable wing that have waft her away .
But poor King Aegeus , day after day , infirm a he be , have clamber to the summit of a cliff that overhang the sea , and there sit watch for Prince Theseus , homeward bound ; and no sooner do he behold the fatal blackness of the sail , than he conclude that his dear son , whom he love so much , and felt so proud of , have be eat by the Minotaur .
He could not bear the thought of live any longer ; so , first fling his crown and sceptre into the sea -LRB- useless bauble that they be to him now -RRB- , King Aegeus merely stoop forward , and fell headlong over the cliff , and be drown , poor soul , in the wave that foam at it base !
This be melancholy news for Prince Theseus , who , when he step ashore , find himself king of all the country , whether he would or no ; and such a turn of fortune be enough to make any young man feel very much out of spirit .
However , he send for his dear mother to Athens , and , by take her advice in matter of state , become a very excellent monarch , and be greatly beloved by his people .
THE PYGMIES .
A great while ago , when the world be full of wonder , there live an earth-born Giant , name Antaeus , and a million or more of curious little earth-born people , who be call Pygmies .
This Giant and these Pygmies be child of the same mother -LRB- that be to say , our good old Grandmother Earth -RRB- , be all brother , and dwell together in a very friendly and affectionate manner , far , far off , in the middle of hot Africa .
The Pygmies be so small , and there be so many sandy desert and such high mountain between them and the rest of mankind , that nobody could get a peep at them oftener than once in a hundred year .
As for the Giant , be of a very lofty stature , it be easy enough to see him , but safe to keep out of his sight .
Among the Pygmies , I suppose , if one of them grow to the height of six or eight inch , he be reckon a prodigiously tall man .
It must have be very pretty to behold their little city , with street two or three foot wide , pave with the small pebble , and border by habitation about as big a a squirrel 's cage .
The king 's palace attain to the stupendous magnitude of Periwinkle 's baby house , and stand in the center of a spacious square , which could hardly have be cover by our hearth-rug .
Their principal temple , or cathedral , be as lofty a yonder bureau , and be look upon a a wonderfully sublime and magnificent edifice .
All these structure be build neither of stone nor wood .
They be neatly plaster together by the Pygmy workman , pretty much like bird ' nest , out of straw , feather , egg shell , and other small bit of stuff , with stiff clay instead of mortar ; and when the hot sun have dry them , they be just a snug and comfortable a a Pygmy could desire .
The country round about be conveniently lay out in field , the large of which be nearly of the same extent a one of Sweet Fern 's flower bed .
Here the Pygmies use to plant wheat and other kind of grain , which , when it grow up and ripen , overshadowed these tiny people a the pine , and the oak , and the walnut and chestnut tree overshadow you and me , when we walk in our own tract of woodland .
At harvest time , they be force to go with their little ax and cut down the grain , exactly a a woodcutter make a clearing in the forest ; and when a stalk of wheat , with it overburdened top , chance to come crash down upon an unfortunate Pygmy , it be apt to be a very sad affair .
If it do not smash him all to piece , at least , I be sure , it must have make the poor little fellow 's head ache .
And O , my star !
if the father and mother be so small , what must the child and baby have be ?
A whole family of them might have be put to bed in a shoe , or have creep into an old glove , and play at hide-and-seek in it thumb and finger .
You might have hide a year-old baby under a thimble .
Now these funny Pygmies , a I tell you before , have a Giant for their neighbor and brother , who be big , if possible , than they be little .
He be so very tall that he carry a pine tree , which be eight foot through the butt , for a walking stick .
It take a far-sighted Pygmy , I can assure you , to discern his summit without the help of a telescope ; and sometimes , in misty weather , they could not see his upper half , but only his long leg , which seem to be stride about by themselves .
But at noonday in a clear atmosphere , when the sun shone brightly over him , the Giant Antaeus present a very grand spectacle .
There he use to stand , a perfect mountain of a man , with his great countenance smile down upon his little brother , and his one vast eye -LRB- which be as big a a cart wheel , and place right in the center of his forehead -RRB- give a friendly wink to the whole nation at once .
The Pygmies love to talk with Antaeus ; and fifty time a day , one or another of them would turn up his head , and shout through the hollow of his fist , `` Halloo , brother Antaeus !
How be you , my good fellow ? ''
And when the small distant squeak of their voice reach his ear , the Giant would make answer , `` Pretty well , brother Pygmy , I thank you , '' in a thunderous roar that would have shake down the wall of their strong temple , only that it come from so far aloft .
It be a happy circumstance that Antaeus be the Pygmy people 's friend ; for there be more strength in his little finger than in ten million of such body a this .
If he have be a ill-natured to them a he be to everybody else , he might have beat down their big city at one kick , and hardly have know that he do it .
With the tornado of his breath , he could have strip the roof from a hundred dwelling and send thousand of the inhabitant whirl through the air .
He might have set his immense foot upon a multitude ; and when he take it up again , there would have be a pitiful sight , to be sure .
But , be the son of Mother Earth , a they likewise be , the Giant give them his brotherly kindness , and love them with as big a love a it be possible to feel for creature so very small .
And , on their part , the Pygmies love Antaeus with as much affection a their tiny heart could hold .
He be always ready to do them any good office that lay in his power ; a for example , when they want a breeze to turn their windmill , the Giant would set all the sail a-going with the mere natural respiration of his lung .
When the sun be too hot , he often sit himself down , and let his shadow fall over the kingdom , from one frontier to the other ; and a for matter in general , he be wise enough to let them alone , and leave the Pygmies to manage their own affair -- which , after all , be about the best thing that great people can do for little one .
In short , a I say before , Antaeus love the Pygmies , and the Pygmies love Antaeus .
The Giant 's life be as long a his body be large , while the lifetime of a Pygmy be but a span , this friendly intercourse have be go on for innumerable generation and age .
It be write about in the Pygmy history , and talk about in their ancient tradition .
The most venerable and white-bearded Pygmy have never hear of a time , even in his great of grandfather ' day , when the Giant be not their enormous friend .
Once , to be sure -LRB- a be record on an obelisk , three foot high , erect on the place of the catastrophe -RRB- , Antaeus sit down upon about five thousand Pygmies , who be assemble at a military review .
But this be one of those unlucky accident for which nobody be to blame ; so that the small folk never take it to heart , and only request the Giant to be careful forever afterwards to examine the acre of ground where he intend to squat himself .
It be a very pleasant picture to imagine Antaeus stand among the Pygmies , like the spire of the tall cathedral that ever be build , while they run about like pismire at his foot ; and to think that , in spite of their difference in size , there be affection and sympathy between them and him !
Indeed , it have always seem to me that the Giant need the little people more than the Pygmies need the Giant .
For , unless they have be his neighbor and well wishers , and , a we may say , his playfellow , Antaeus would not have have a single friend in the world .
No other be like himself have ever be create .
No creature of his own size have ever talk with him , in thunder-like accent , face to face .
When he stand with his head among the cloud , he be quite alone , and have be so for hundred of year , and would be so forever .
Even if he have meet another Giant , Antaeus would have fancy the world not big enough for two such vast personage , and , instead of be friend with him , would have fight him till one of the two be kill .
But with the Pygmies he be the most sportive and humorous , and merry-hearted , and sweet-tempered old Giant that ever wash his face in a wet cloud .
His little friend , like all other small people , have a great opinion of their own importance , and use to assume quite a patronizing air towards the Giant .
`` Poor creature ! ''
they say one to another .
`` He have a very dull time of it , all by himself ; and we ought not to grudge waste a little of our precious time to amuse him .
He be not half so bright a we be , to be sure ; and , for that reason , he need u to look after his comfort and happiness .
Let u be kind to the old fellow .
Why , if Mother Earth have not be very kind to ourselves , we might all have be Giants too . ''
On all their holiday , the Pygmies have excellent sport with Antaeus .
He often stretch himself out at full length on the ground , where he look like the long ridge of a hill ; and it be a good hour 's walk , no doubt , for a short-legged Pygmy to journey from head to foot of the Giant .
He would lay down his great hand flat on the grass , and challenge the tall of them to clamber upon it , and straddle from finger to finger .
So fearless be they , that they make nothing of creep in among the fold of his garment .
When his head lay sidewise on the earth , they would march boldly up , and peep into the great cavern of his mouth , and take it all a a joke -LRB- a indeed it be mean -RRB- when Antaeus give a sudden snap of his jaw , a if he be go to swallow fifty of them at once .
You would have laugh to see the child dodge in and out among his hair , or swing from his beard .
It be impossible to tell half of the funny trick that they play with their huge comrade ; but I do not know that anything be more curious than when a party of boy be see run race on his forehead , to try which of them could get first round the circle of his one great eye .
It be another favorite feat with them to march along the bridge of his nose , and jump down upon his upper lip .
If the truth must be tell , they be sometimes as troublesome to the Giant a a swarm of ant or mosquito , especially a they have a fondness for mischief , and like to prick his skin with their little sword and lance , to see how thick and tough it be .
But Antaeus take it all kindly enough ; although , once in a while , when he happen to be sleepy , he would grumble out a peevish word or two , like the muttering of a tempest , and ask them to have do with their nonsense .
A great deal oftener , however , he watch their merriment and gambol until his huge , heavy , clumsy wit be completely stir up by them ; and then would he roar out such a tremendous volume of immeasurable laughter , that the whole nation of Pygmies have to put their hand to their ear , else it would certainly have deafen them .
`` Ho !
ho !
ho ! ''
quoth the Giant , shake his mountainous side .
`` What a funny thing it be to be little !
If I be not Antaeus , I should like to be a Pygmy , just for the joke 's sake . ''
The Pygmies have but one thing to trouble them in the world .
They be constantly at war with the crane , and have always be so , ever since the long-lived Giant could remember .
From time to time , very terrible battle have be fight in which sometimes the little men win the victory , and sometimes the crane .
According to some historian , the Pygmies use to go to the battle , mount on the back of goat and ram ; but such animal a these must have be far too big for Pygmies to ride upon ; so that , I rather suppose , they ride on squirrel-back , or rabbit-back , or rat-back , or perhaps get upon hedgehog , whose prickly quill would be very terrible to the enemy .
However this might be , and whatever creatures the Pygmies rode upon , I do not doubt that they make a formidable appearance , arm with sword and spear , and bow and arrow , blow their tiny trumpet , and shout their little war cry .
They never fail to exhort one another to fight bravely , and recollect that the world have it eye upon them ; although , in simple truth , the only spectator be the Giant Antaeus , with his one , great , stupid eye in the middle of his forehead .
When the two army join battle , the crane would rush forward , flap their wing and stretch out their neck , and would perhaps snatch up some of the Pygmies crosswise in their beak .
Whenever this happen , it be truly an awful spectacle to see those little men of might kick and sprawl in the air , and at last disappear down the crane 's long , crooked throat , swallow up alive .
A hero , you know , must hold himself in readiness for any kind of fate ; and doubtless the glory of the thing be a consolation to him , even in the crane 's gizzard .
If Antaeus observe that the battle be go hard against his little ally , he generally stop laugh , and run with mile-long stride to their assistance , flourish his club aloft and shout at the crane , who quack and croak , and retreat as fast a they could .
Then the Pygmy army would march homeward in triumph , attribute the victory entirely to their own valor , and to the warlike skill and strategy of whomsoever happen to be captain general ; and for a tedious while afterwards , nothing would be hear of but grand procession , and public banquet , and brilliant illumination , and show of wax-work , with likeness of the distinguished officer , as small a life .
In the above-described warfare , if a Pygmy chance to pluck out a crane 's tail feather , it prove a very great feather in his cap .
Once or twice , if you will believe me , a little man be make chief ruler of the nation for no other merit in the world than bring home such a feather .
But I have now say enough to let you see what a gallant little people these be , and how happily they and their forefather , for nobody know how many generation , have live with the immeasurable Giant Antaeus .
In the remain part of the story , I shall tell you of a far more astonishing battle than any that be fight between the Pygmies and the crane .
One day the mighty Antaeus be loll at full length among his little friend .
His pine-tree walking stick lay on the ground , close by his side .
His head be in one part of the kingdom , and his foot extend across the boundary of another part ; and he be take whatever comfort he could get , while the Pygmies scramble over him , and peep into his cavernous mouth , and play among his hair .
Sometimes , for a minute or two , the Giant drop asleep , and snore like the rush of a whirlwind .
During one of these little bit of slumber , a Pygmy chance to climb upon his shoulder , and take a view around the horizon , a from the summit of a hill ; and he behold something , a long way off , which make him rub the bright speck of his eye , and look sharp than before .
At first he mistake it for a mountain , and wonder how it have grow up so suddenly out of the earth .
But soon he saw the mountain move .
As it come nearer and nearer , what should it turn out to be but a human shape , not so big a Antaeus , it be true , although a very enormous figure , in comparison with Pygmies , and a vast deal big than the men we see nowadays .
When the Pygmy be quite satisfied that his eye have not deceive him , he scamper , a fast a his leg would carry him , to the Giant 's ear , and stoop over it cavity , shout lustily into it : `` Halloo , brother Antaeus !
Get up this minute , and take your pine-tree walking stick in your hand .
Here come another Giant to have a tussle with you . ''
`` Poh , poh ! ''
grumble Antaeus , only half awake .
`` None of your nonsense , my little fellow !
Do n't you see I 'm sleepy ?
There be not a Giant on earth for whom I would take the trouble to get up . ''
But the Pygmy look again , and now perceive that the stranger be come directly towards the prostrate form of Antaeus .
With every step , he look less like a blue mountain , and more like an immensely large man .
He be soon so nigh , that there could be no possible mistake about the matter .
There he be , with the sun flame on his golden helmet , and flash from his polished breastplate ; he have a sword by his side , and a lion 's skin over his back , and on his right shoulder he carry a club , which look bulky and heavy than the pine-tree walking stick of Antaeus .
By this time , the whole nation of the Pygmies have see the new wonder , and a million of them set up a shout all together ; so that it really make quite an audible squeak .
`` Get up , Antaeus !
Bestir yourself , you lazy old Giant !
Here come another Giant , as strong a you be , to fight with you . ''
`` Nonsense , nonsense ! ''
growl the sleepy Giant .
`` I 'll have my nap out , come who may . ''
Still the stranger draw nearer ; and now the Pygmies could plainly discern that , if his stature be less lofty than the Giant 's , yet his shoulder be even broad .
And , in truth , what a pair of shoulder they must have be !
As I tell you , a long while ago , they once uphold the sky .
The Pygmies , be ten time as vivacious a their great numskull of a brother , could not abide the Giant 's slow movement , and be determine to have him on his foot .
So they keep shout to him , and even go so far a to prick him with their sword .
`` Get up , get up , get up , '' they cry .
`` Up with you , lazy bone !
The strange Giant 's club be big than your own , his shoulder be the broad , and we think him the strong of the two . ''
Antaeus could not endure to have it say that any mortal be half so mighty a himself .
This latter remark of the Pygmies prick him deep than their sword ; and , sit up , in rather a sulky humor , he give a gape of several yard wide , rub his eye , and finally turn his stupid head in the direction whither his little friend be eagerly point .
No sooner do he set eye on the stranger , than , leap on his foot , and seize his walk stick , he stride a mile or two to meet him ; all the while brandish the sturdy pine tree , so that it whistle through the air .
`` Who be you ? ''
thunder the Giant .
`` And what do you want in my dominion ? ''
There be one strange thing about Antaeus , of which I have not yet tell you , l , hearing of so many wonder all in a lump , you might not believe much more than half of them .
You be to know , then , that whenever this redoubtable Giant touch the ground , either with his hand , his foot , or any other part of his body , he grow strong than ever he have be before .
The Earth , you remember , be his mother , and be very fond of him , a be almost the big of her child ; and so she take this method of keep him always in full vigor .
Some person affirm that he grow ten time strong at every touch ; others say that it be only twice a strong .
But only think of it !
Whenever Antaeus take a walk , suppose it be but ten mile , and that he step a hundred yard at a stride , you may try to cipher out how much mighty he be , on sit down again , than when he first start .
And whenever he fling himself on the earth to take a little repose , even if he get up the very next instant , he would be as strong a exactly ten just such giant a his former self .
It be well for the world that Antaeus happen to be of a sluggish disposition and like ease well than exercise ; for , if he have frisk about like the Pygmies , and touch the earth as often a they do , he would long ago have be strong enough to pull down the sky about people 's ear .
But these great lubberly fellows resemble mountain , not only in bulk , but in their disinclination to move .
Any other mortal man , except the very one whom Antaeus have now encounter , would have be half frighten to death by the Giant 's ferocious aspect and terrible voice .
But the stranger do not seem at all disturbed .
He carelessly lift his club , and balance it in his hand , measure Antaeus with his eye , from head to foot , not a if wonder-smitten at his stature , but a if he have see a great many Giants before , and this be by no mean the big of them .
In fact , if the Giant have be no big than the Pygmies -LRB- who stand prick up their ear , and look and listen to what be go forward -RRB- , the stranger could not have be less afraid of him .
`` Who be you , I say ? ''
roar Antaeus again .
`` What 's your name ?
Why do you come hither ?
Speak , you vagabond , or I 'll try the thickness of your skull with my walking-stick ! ''
`` You be a very discourteous Giant , '' answer the stranger quietly , `` and I shall probably have to teach you a little civility , before we part .
As for my name , it be Hercules .
I have come hither because this be my most convenient road to the garden of the Hesperides , whither I be go to get three of the golden apple for King Eurystheus . ''
`` Caitiff , you shall go no farther ! ''
bellow Antaeus , put on a grimmer look than before ; for he have hear of the mighty Hercules , and hat him because he be say to be so strong .
`` Neither shall you go back whence you come ! ''
`` How will you prevent me , '' ask Hercules , `` from go whither I please ? ''
`` By hit you a rap with this pine tree here , '' shout Antaeus , scowl so that he make himself the ugly monster in Africa .
`` I be fifty time strong than you ; and now that I stamp my foot upon the ground , I be five hundred time strong !
I be ashamed to kill such a puny little dwarf a you seem to be .
I will make a slave of you , and you shall likewise be the slave of my brother here , the Pygmies .
So throw down your club and your other weapon ; and a for that lion 's skin , I intend to have a pair of glove make of it . ''
`` Come and take it off my shoulder , then , '' answer Hercules , lift his club .
Then the Giant , grin with rage , strode tower-like towards the stranger -LRB- ten time strengthen at every step -RRB- , and fetch a monstrous blow at him with his pine tree , which Hercules catch upon his club ; and be more skilful than Antaeus , he pay him back such a rap upon the sconce , that down tumble the great lumbering man-mountain , flat upon the ground .
The poor little Pygmies -LRB- who really never dream that anybody in the world be half so strong a their brother Antaeus -RRB- be a good deal dismay at this .
But no sooner be the Giant down , than up he bounce again , with tenfold might , and such a furious visage a be horrible to behold .
He aim another blow at Hercules , but strike awry , be blind with wrath , and only hit his poor innocent Mother Earth , who groan and tremble at the stroke .
His pine tree go so deep into the ground , and stick there so fast , that , before Antaeus could get it out , Hercules bring down his club across his shoulder with a mighty thwack , which make the Giant roar a if all sort of intolerable noise have come screeching and rumble out of his immeasurable lung in that one cry .
Away it go , over mountain and valley , and , for aught I know , be hear on the other side of the African desert .
As for the Pygmies , their capital city be lay in ruin by the concussion and vibration of the air ; and , though there be uproar enough without their help , they all set up a shriek out of three million of little throat , fancy , no doubt , that they swell the Giant 's bellow by at least ten time as much .
Meanwhile , Antaeus have scramble upon his foot again , and pull his pine tree out of the earth ; and , all aflame with fury , and more outrageously strong than ever , he run at Hercules , and bring down another blow .
`` This time , rascal , '' shout he , `` you shall not escape me . ''
But once more Hercules ward off the stroke with his club , and the Giant 's pine tree be shatter into a thousand splinter , most of which fly among the Pygmies , and do them more mischief than I like to think about .
Before Antaeus could get out of the way , Hercules let drive again , and give him another knock-down blow , which send him heel over head , but serve only to increase his already enormous and insufferable strength .
As for his rage , there be no tell what a fiery furnace it have now get to be .
His one eye be nothing but a circle of red flame .
Having now no weapon but his fist , he double them up -LRB- each big than a hogshead -RRB- , smite one against the other , and dance up and down with absolute frenzy , flourish his immense arm about , a if he mean not merely to kill Hercules , but to smash the whole world to piece .
`` Come on ! ''
roar this thunder Giant .
`` Let me hit you but one box on the ear , and you 'll never have the headache again . ''
Now Hercules -LRB- though strong enough , a you already know , to hold the sky up -RRB- begin to be sensible that he should never win the victory , if he keep on knock Antaeus down ; for , by and by , if he hit him such hard blow , the Giant would inevitably , by the help of his Mother Earth , become strong than the mighty Hercules himself .
So , throw down his club , with which he have fight so many dreadful battle , the hero stand ready to receive his antagonist with naked arm .
`` Step forward , '' cry he .
`` Since I 've break your pine tree , we 'll try which be the good man at a wrestling match . ''
`` Aha !
then I 'll soon satisfy you , '' shout the Giant ; for , if there be one thing on which he pride himself more than another , it be his skill in wrestling .
`` Villain , I 'll fling you where you can never pick yourself up again . ''
On come Antaeus , hop and caper with the scorch heat of his rage , and get new vigor wherewith to wreak his passion , every time he hop .
But Hercules , you must understand , be wise than this numskull of a Giant , and have think of a way to fight him -- huge , earth-born monster that he be -- and to conquer him too , in spite of all that his Mother Earth could do for him .
Watching his opportunity , a the mad Giant make a rush at him , Hercules catch him round the middle with both hand , lift him high into the air , and hold him aloft overhead .
Just imagine it , my dear little friend .
What a spectacle it must have be , to see this monstrous fellow sprawl in the air , face downwards , kick out his long leg and wriggle his whole vast body , like a baby when it father hold it at arm 's length towards the ceiling .
But the most wonderful thing be , that , as soon a Antaeus be fairly off the earth , he begin to lose the vigor which he have gain by touch it .
Hercules very soon perceive that his troublesome enemy be grow weak , both because he struggle and kick with less violence , and because the thunder of his big voice subside into a grumble .
The truth be that unless the Giant touch Mother Earth as often a once in five minute , not only his overgrown strength , but the very breath of his life , would depart from him .
Hercules have guess this secret ; and it may be well for u all to remember it , in case we should ever have to fight a battle with a fellow like Antaeus .
For these earth-born creature be only difficult to conquer on their own ground , but may easily be manage if we can contrive to lift them into a lofty and pure region .
So it prove with the poor Giant , whom I be really a little sorry for , notwithstanding his uncivil way of treat stranger who come to visit him .
When his strength and breath be quite go , Hercules give his huge body a toss , and fling it about a mile off , where it fell heavily , and lay with no more motion than a sand hill .
It be too late for the Giant 's Mother Earth to help him now ; and I should not wonder if his ponderous bone be lie on the same spot to this very day , and be mistake for those of an uncommonly large elephant .
But , ala me !
What a wailing do the poor little Pygmies set up when they saw their enormous brother treat in this terrible manner !
If Hercules hear their shriek , however , he take no notice , and perhaps fancy them only the shrill , plaintive twittering of small bird that have be frighten from their nest by the uproar of the battle between himself and Antaeus .
Indeed , his thought have be so much take up with the Giant , that he have never once look at the Pygmies , nor even know that there be such a funny little nation in the world .
And now , a he have travel a good way , and be also rather weary with his exertion in the fight , he spread out his lion 's skin on the ground , and , recline himself upon it , fell fast asleep .
As soon a the Pygmies saw Hercules prepare for a nap , they nod their little head at one another , and wink with their little eye .
And when his deep , regular breathing give them notice that he be asleep , they assemble together in an immense crowd , spread over a space of about twenty-seven foot square .
One of their most eloquent orator -LRB- and a valiant warrior enough , besides , though hardly so good at any other weapon a he be with his tongue -RRB- climb upon a toadstool , and , from that elevated position , address the multitude .
His sentiment be pretty much a follow ; or , at all event , something like this be probably the upshot of his speech : `` Tall Pygmies and mighty little men !
You and all of u have see what a public calamity have be bring to pass , and what an insult have here be offer to the majesty of our nation .
Yonder lie Antaeus , our great friend and brother , slain , within our territory , by a miscreant who take him at disadvantage , and fight him -LRB- if fight it can be call -RRB- in a way that neither man , nor Giant , nor Pygmy ever dream of fighting , until this hour .
And , add a grievous contumely to the wrong already do u , the miscreant have now fall asleep as quietly a if nothing be to be dread from our wrath !
It behoove you , fellow-countrymen , to consider in what aspect we shall stand before the world , and what will be the verdict of impartial history , should we suffer these accumulate outrage to go unavenged .
`` Antaeus be our brother , born of that same beloved parent to whom we owe the thews and sinew , as well a the courageous heart , which make him proud of our relationship .
He be our faithful ally , and fell fight as much for our national right and immunity a for his own personal one .
We and our forefather have dwell in friendship with him , and hold affectionate intercourse a man to man , through immemorial generation .
You remember how often our entire people have repose in his great shadow , and how our little one have play at hide-and-seek in the tangle of his hair , and how his mighty footstep have familiarly go to and fro among u , and never trodden upon any of our toe .
And there lie this dear brother -- this sweet and amiable friend -- this brave and faithful ally -- this virtuous Giant -- this blameless and excellent Antaeus -- dead !
Dead !
Silent !
Powerless !
A mere mountain of clay !
Forgive my tear !
Nay , I behold your own .
Were we to drown the world with them , could the world blame u ?
`` But to resume : Shall we , my countryman , suffer this wicked stranger to depart unharmed , and triumph in his treacherous victory , among distant community of the earth ?
Shall we not rather compel him to leave his bone here on our soil , by the side of our slain brother 's bone ?
so that , while one skeleton shall remain a the everlasting monument of our sorrow , the other shall endure a long , exhibit to the whole human race a terrible example of Pygmy vengeance !
Such be the question .
I put it to you in full confidence of a response that shall be worthy of our national character , and calculate to increase , rather than diminish , the glory which our ancestor have transmit to u , and which we ourselves have proudly vindicate in our warfare with the crane . ''
The orator be here interrupt by a burst of irrepressible enthusiasm ; every individual Pygmy cry out that the national honor must be preserve at all hazard .
He bow , and , make a gesture for silence , wind up his harangue in the following admirable manner : `` It only remain for u , then , to decide whether we shall carry on the war in our national capacity -- one united people against a common enemy -- or whether some champion , famous in former fight , shall be select to defy the slayer of our brother Antaeus to single combat .
In the latter case , though not unconscious that there may be taller men among you , I hereby offer myself for that enviable duty .
And believe me , dear countryman , whether I live or die , the honor of this great country , and the fame bequeath u by our heroic progenitor , shall suffer no diminution in my hand .
Never , while I can wield this sword , of which I now fling away the scabbard -- never , never , never , even if the crimson hand that slew the great Antaeus shall lay me prostrate , like him , on the soil which I give my life to defend . ''
So say , this valiant Pygmy draw out his weapon -LRB- which be terrible to behold , be as long a the blade of a penknife -RRB- , and send the scabbard whirling over the head of the multitude .
His speech be follow by an uproar of applause , a it patriotism and self-devotion unquestionably deserve ; and the shout and clapping of hand would have be greatly prolonged , have they not be render quite inaudible by a deep respiration , vulgarly call a snore , from the sleep Hercules .
It be finally decide that the whole nation of Pygmies should set to work to destroy Hercules ; not , be it understood , from any doubt that a single champion would be capable of put him to the sword , but because he be a public enemy , and all be desirous of share in the glory of his defeat .
There be a debate whether the national honor do not demand that a herald should be send with a trumpet , to stand over the ear of Hercules , and after blow a blast right into it , to defy him to the combat by formal proclamation .
But two or three venerable and sagacious Pygmies , well verse in state affair , give it a their opinion that war already exist , and that it be their rightful privilege to take the enemy by surprise .
Moreover , if awaken , and allow to get upon his foot , Hercules might happen to do them a mischief before he could be beat down again .
For , a these sage counselor remark , the stranger 's club be really very big , and have rattle like a thunderbolt against the skull of Antaeus .
So the Pygmies resolve to set aside all foolish punctilio , and assail their antagonist at once .
Accordingly , all the fight men of the nation take their weapon , and go boldly up to Hercules , who still lay fast asleep , little dreaming of the harm which the Pygmies meant to do him .
A body of twenty thousand archer march in front , with their little bow all ready , and the arrow on the string .
The same number be order to clamber upon Hercules , some with spade to dig his eye out , and others with bundle of hay , and all manner of rubbish with which they intend to plug up his mouth and nostril , so that he might perish for lack of breath .
These last , however , could by no mean perform their appoint duty ; inasmuch a the enemy 's breath rush out of his nose in an obstreperous hurricane and whirlwind , which blow the Pygmies away as fast a they come nigh .
It be find necessary , therefore , to hit upon some other method of carry on the war .
After hold a council , the captain order their troop to collect stick , straw , dry weed , and whatever combustible stuff they could find , and make a pile of it , heap it high around the head of Hercules .
As a great many thousand Pygmies be employ in this task , they soon bring together several bushel of inflammatory matter , and raise so tall a heap , that , mount on it summit , they be quite upon a level with the sleeper 's face .
The archer , meanwhile , be station within bow shot , with order to let fly at Hercules the instant that he stir .
Everything be in readiness , a torch be apply to the pile , which immediately burst into flame , and soon wax hot enough to roast the enemy , have he but choose to lie still .
A Pygmy , you know , though so very small , might set the world on fire , just as easily a a Giant could ; so that this be certainly the very best way of deal with their foe , provide they could have keep him quiet while the conflagration be go forward .
But no sooner do Hercules begin to be scorch , than up he start , with his hair in a red blaze .
`` What 's all this ? ''
he cry , bewilder with sleep , and star about him a if he expect to see another Giant .
At that moment the twenty thousand archer twang their bowstring , and the arrow come whiz , like so many wing mosquito , right into the face of Hercules .
But I doubt whether more than half a dozen of them puncture the skin , which be remarkably tough , a you know the skin of a hero have good need to be .
`` Villain ! ''
shout all the Pygmies at once .
`` You have kill the Giant Antaeus , our great brother , and the ally of our nation .
We declare bloody war against you , and will slay you on the spot . ''
Surprised at the shrill piping of so many little voice , Hercules , after put out the conflagration of his hair , gaze all round about , but could see nothing .
At last , however , look narrowly on the ground , he espy the innumerable assemblage of Pygmies at his foot .
He stoop down , and take up the near one between his thumb and finger , set him on the palm of his left hand , and hold him at a proper distance for examination .
It chance to be the very identical Pygmy who have speak from the top of the toadstool , and have offer himself a a champion to meet Hercules in single combat .
`` What in the world , my little fellow , '' ejaculate Hercules , `` may you be ? ''
`` I be your enemy , '' answer the valiant Pygmy , in his mighty squeak .
`` You have slay the enormous Antaeus , our brother by the mother 's side , and for age the faithful ally of our illustrious nation .
We be determine to put you to death ; and for my own part , I challenge you to instant battle , on equal ground . ''
Hercules be so tickled with the Pygmy 's big word and warlike gesture , that he burst into a great explosion of laughter , and almost drop the poor little mite of a creature off the palm of his hand , through the ecstasy and convulsion of his merriment .
`` Upon my word , '' cry he , `` I think I have see wonder before to-day -- hydra with nine head , stag with golden horn , six-legged men , three-headed dog , giant with furnace in their stomach , and nobody know what besides .
But here , on the palm of my hand , stand a wonder that outdo them all !
Your body , my little friend , be about the size of an ordinary man 's finger .
Pray , how big may your soul be ? ''
`` As big a your own ! ''
say the Pygmy .
Hercules be touch with the little man 's dauntless courage , and could not help acknowledge such a brotherhood with him a one hero feel for another .
`` My good little people , '' say he , make a low obeisance to the grand nation , `` not for all the world would I do an intentional injury to such brave fellow a you !
Your heart seem to me so exceedingly great , that , upon my honor , I marvel how your small body can contain them .
I sue for peace , and , a a condition of it , will take five stride , and be out of your kingdom at the sixth .
Good-bye .
I shall pick my step carefully , for fear of tread upon some fifty of you , without know it .
Ha , ha , ha !
Ho , ho , ho !
For once , Hercules acknowledge himself vanquish . ''
Some writer say , that Hercules gather up the whole race of Pygmies in his lion 's skin , and carry them home to Greece , for the child of King Eurystheus to play with .
But this be a mistake .
He leave them , one and all , within their own territory , where , for aught I can tell , their descendant be alive to the present day , build their little house , cultivate their little field , spank their little child , wag their little warfare with the crane , do their little business , whatever it may be , and read their little history of ancient time .
In those history , perhaps , it stand record , that , a great many century ago , the valiant Pygmies avenge the death of the Giant Antaeus by scar away the mighty Hercules .
THE DRAGON 'S TEETH .
Cadmus , Phoenix , and Cilix , the three son of King Agenor , and their little sister Europa -LRB- who be a very beautiful child -RRB- , be at play together near the seashore in their father 's kingdom of Phoenicia .
They have ramble to some distance from the palace where their parent dwell , and be now in a verdant meadow , on one side of which lay the sea , all sparkling and dimpling in the sunshine , and murmur gently against the beach .
The three boy be very happy , gather flower , and twin them into garland , with which they adorn the little Europa .
Seated on the grass , the child be almost hide under an abundance of bud and blossom , whence her rosy face peep merrily out , and , a Cadmus say , be the pretty of all the flower .
Just then , there come a splendid butterfly , flutter along the meadow ; and Cadmus , Phoenix , and Cilix set off in pursuit of it , cry out that it be a flower with wing .
Europa , who be a little wearied with play all day long , do not chase the butterfly with her brother , but sit still where they have leave her , and close her eye .
For a while , she listen to the pleasant murmur of the sea , which be like a voice say `` Hush ! ''
and bidding her go to sleep .
But the pretty child , if she sleep at all , could not have slept more than a moment , when she hear something trample on the grass , not far from her , and , peep out from the heap of flower , behold a snow-white bull .
And whence could this bull have com ?
Europa and her brother have be a long time playing in the meadow , and have see no cattle , nor other live thing , either there or on the neighboring hill .
`` Brother Cadmus ! ''
cry Europa , start up out of the midst of the rose and lily .
`` Phoenix !
Cilix !
Where be you all ?
Help !
Help !
Come and drive away this bull ! ''
But her brother be too far off to hear ; especially a the fright take away Europa 's voice , and hinder her from call very loudly .
So there she stand , with her pretty mouth wide open , as pale a the white lily that be twist among the other flower in her garland .
Nevertheless , it be the suddenness with which she have perceive the bull , rather than anything frightful in his appearance , that cause Europa so much alarm .
On look at him more attentively , she begin to see that he be a beautiful animal , and even fancy a particularly amiable expression in his face .
As for his breath -- the breath of cattle , you know , be always sweet -- it be as fragrant a if he have be graze on no other food than rosebud , or at least , the most delicate of clover blossom .
Never before do a bull have such bright and tender eye , and such smooth horn of ivory , a this one .
And the bull run little race , and caper sportively around the child ; so that she quite forget how big and strong he be , and , from the gentleness and playfulness of his action , soon come to consider him a innocent a creature a a pet lamb .
Thus , frighten a she at first be , you might by and by have see Europa stroke the bull 's forehead with her small white hand , and take the garland off her own head to hang them on his neck and ivory horn .
Then she pull up some blade of grass , and he eat them out of her hand , not a if he be hungry , but because he want to be friend with the child , and take pleasure in eat what she have touch .
Well , my star !
be there ever such a gentle , sweet , pretty , and amiable creature a this bull , and ever such a nice playmate for a little girl ?
When the animal saw -LRB- for the bull have so much intelligence that it be really wonderful to think of -RRB- , when he saw that Europa be no long afraid of him , he grow overjoy , and could hardly contain himself for delight .
He frisk about the meadow , now here , now there , make sprightly leap , with as little effort a a bird expend in hop from twig to twig .
Indeed , his motion be as light a if he be fly through the air , and his hoof seem hardly to leave their print in the grassy soil over which he tread .
With his spotless hue , he resemble a snow drift , waft along by the wind .
Once he gallop so far away that Europa fear l she might never see him again ; so , set up her childish voice , call him back .
`` Come back , pretty creature ! ''
she cry .
`` Here be a nice clover blossom . ''
And then it be delightful to witness the gratitude of this amiable bull , and how he be so full of joy and thankfulness that he caper high than ever .
He come run , and bow his head before Europa , a if he know her to be a king 's daughter , or else recognize the important truth that a little girl be everybody 's queen .
And not only do the bull bend his neck , he absolutely kneel down at her foot , and make such intelligent nod , and other inviting gesture , that Europa understand what he mean just as well a if he have put it in so many word .
`` Come , dear child , '' be what he want to say , `` let me give you a ride on my back . ''
At the first thought of such a thing , Europa draw back .
But then she consider in her wise little head that there could be no possible harm in take just one gallop on the back of this docile and friendly animal , who would certainly set her down the very instant she desire it .
And how it would surprise her brother to see her rid across the green meadow !
And what merry time they might have , either take turn for a gallop , or clamber on the gentle creature , all four child together , and career round the field with shout of laughter that would be hear a far off a King Agenor 's palace !
`` I think I will do it , '' say the child to herself .
And , indeed , why not ?
She cast a glance around , and catch a glimpse of Cadmus , Phoenix , and Cilix , who be still in pursuit of the butterfly , almost at the other end of the meadow .
It would be the quick way of rejoin them , to get upon the white bull 's back .
She come a step nearer to him therefore ; and -- sociable creature that he be -- he show so much joy at this mark of her confidence , that the child could not find in her heart to hesitate any long .
Making one bound -LRB- for this little princess be as active a a squirrel -RRB- , there sat Europa on the beautiful bull , hold an ivory horn in each hand , lest she should fall off .
`` Softly , pretty bull , softly ! ''
she say , rather frighten at what she have do .
`` Do not gallop too fast . ''
Having get the child on his back , the animal give a leap into the air , and come down so like a feather that Europa do not know when his hoof touch the ground .
He then begin a race to that part of the flowery plain where her three brother be , and where they have just catch their splendid butterfly .
Europa scream with delight ; and Phoenix , Cilix , and Cadmus stand gap at the spectacle of their sister mount on a white bull , not know whether to be frighten or to wish the same good luck for themselves .
The gentle and innocent creature -LRB- for who could possibly doubt that he be so ? -RRB-
prance round among the child as sportively a a kitten .
Europa all the while look down upon her brother , nod and laugh , but yet with a sort of stateliness in her rosy little face .
As the bull wheel about to take another gallop across the meadow , the child wave her hand , and say , `` Good-bye , '' playfully pretend that she be now bind on a distant journey , and might not see her brother again for nobody could tell how long .
`` Good-bye , '' shout Cadmus , Phoenix , and Cilix , all in one breath .
But , together with her enjoyment of the sport , there be still a little remnant of fear in the child 's heart ; so that her last look at the three boy be a troubled one , and make them feel a if their dear sister be really leave them forever .
And what do you think the snowy bull do next ?
Why , he set off , as swift a the wind , straight down to the seashore , scamper across the sand , take an airy leap , and plunge right in among the foaming billow .
The white spray rise in a shower over him and little Europa , and fell spatter down upon the water .
Then what a scream of terror do the poor child send forth !
The three brother scream manfully , likewise , and run to the shore as fast a their leg would carry them , with Cadmus at their head .
But it be too late .
When they reach the margin of the sand , the treacherous animal be already far away in the wide blue sea , with only his snowy head and tail emerging , and poor little Europa between them , stretch out one hand towards her dear brother , while she grasp the bull 's ivory horn with the other .
And there stood Cadmus , Phoenix , and Cilix , gaze at this sad spectacle , through their tear , until they could no longer distinguish the bull 's snowy head from the white-capped billow that seem to boil up out of the sea 's depth around him .
Nothing more be ever see of the white bull -- nothing more of the beautiful child .
This be a mournful story , a you may well think , for the three boy to carry home to their parent .
King Agenor , their father , be the ruler of the whole country ; but he love his little daughter Europa good than his kingdom , or than all his other child , or than anything else in the world .
Therefore , when Cadmus and his two brother come cry home , and tell him how that a white bull have carry off their sister , and swam with her over the sea , the king be quite beside himself with grief and rage .
Although it be now twilight , and fast grow dark , he bid them set out instantly in search of her .
`` Never shall you see my face again , '' he cry , `` unless you bring me back my little Europa , to gladden me with her smile and her pretty way .
Begone , and enter my presence no more , till you come lead her by the hand . ''
As King Agenor say this , his eye flash fire -LRB- for he be a very passionate king -RRB- , and he look so terribly angry that the poor boy do not even venture to ask for their supper , but slink away out of the palace , and only pause on the step a moment to consult whither they should go first .
While they be stand there , all in dismay , their mother , Queen Telephassa -LRB- who happen not to be by when they tell the story to the king -RRB- , come hurrying after them , and say that she too would go in quest of her daughter .
`` O , no , mother ! ''
cry the boy .
`` The night be dark , and there be no know what trouble and peril we may meet with . ''
`` Alas !
my dear child , '' answer poor Queen Telephassa ; weep bitterly , `` that be only another reason why I should go with you .
If I should lose you , too , as well a my little Europa , what would become of me ! ''
`` And let me go likewise ! ''
say their playfellow Thasus , who come run to join them .
Thasus be the son of a seafaring person in the neighborhood ; he have be bring up with the young prince , and be their intimate friend , and love Europa very much ; so they consent that he should accompany them .
The whole party , therefore , set forth together .
Cadmus , Phoenix , Cilix , and Thasus cluster round Queen Telephassa , grasp her skirt , and beg her to lean upon their shoulder whenever she felt weary .
In this manner they go down the palace step , and begin a journey , which turn out to be a great deal long than they dream of .
The last that they saw of King Agenor , he come to the door , with a servant hold a torch beside him , and call after them into the gathering darkness : `` Remember !
Never ascend these step again without the child ! ''
`` Never ! ''
sob Queen Telephassa ; and the three brother and Thasus answer , `` Never !
Never !
Never !
Never ! ''
And they keep their word .
Year after year , King Agenor sit in the solitude of his beautiful palace , listen in vain for their returning footstep , hop to hear the familiar voice of the queen , and the cheerful talk of his son and their playfellow Thasus , enter the door together , and the sweet , childish accent of little Europa in the midst of them .
But so long a time go by , that , at last , if they have really come , the king would not have know that this be the voice of Telephassa , and these the young voice that use to make such joyful echo , when the child be play about the palace .
We must now leave King Agenor to sit on his throne , and must go along with Queen Telephassa , and her four youthful companion .
They go on and on , and travel a long way , and pass over mountain and river , and sail over sea .
Here , and there , and everywhere , they make continual inquiry if any person could tell them what have become of Europa .
The rustic people , of whom they ask this question , pause a little while from their labor in the field , and look very much surprise .
They think it strange to behold a woman in the garb of a queen -LRB- for Telephassa in her haste have forget to take off her crown and her royal robe -RRB- , roam about the country , with four lad around her , on such an errand a this seem to be .
But nobody could give them any tidings of Europa ; nobody have see a little girl dress like a princess , and mount on a snow-white bull , which gallop as swiftly a the wind .
I can not tell you how long Queen Telephassa , and Cadmus , Phoenix , and Cilix , her three son , and Thasus , their playfellow , go wander along the highway and bypath , or through the pathless wilderness of the earth , in this manner .
But certain it be , that , before they reach any place of rest , their splendid garment be quite wear out .
They all look very much travel-stained , and would have have the dust of many country on their shoe , if the stream , through which they wad , have not wash it all away .
When they have be go a year , Telephassa throw away her crown , because it chafe her forehead .
`` It have give me many a headache , '' say the poor queen , `` and it can not cure my heartache . ''
As fast a their princely robe get torn and tattered , they exchange them for such mean attire a ordinary people wear .
By and by , they come to have a wild and homeless aspect ; so that you would much sooner have take them for a gypsy family than a queen and three prince , and a young nobleman , who have once a palace for a home , and a train of servant to do their bidding .
The four boy grow up to be tall young men , with sunburnt face .
Each of them gird on a sword , to defend themselves against the peril of the way .
When the husbandman , at whose farmhouse they seek hospitality , need their assistance in the harvest field , they give it willingly ; and Queen Telephassa -LRB- who have do no work in her palace , save to braid silk thread with golden one -RRB- come behind them to bind the sheaf .
If payment be offer , they shake their head , and only ask for tidings of Europa .
`` There be bull enough in my pasture , '' the old farmer would reply ; `` but I never hear of one like this you tell me of .
A snow-white bull with a little princess on his back !
Ho !
ho !
I ask your pardon , good folk ; but there never such a sight see hereabouts . ''
At last , when his upper lip begin to have the down on it , Phoenix grow weary of ramble hither and thither to no purpose .
So one day , when they happen to be pass through a pleasant and solitary tract of country , he sit himself down on a heap of moss .
`` I can go no farther , '' say Phoenix .
`` It be a mere foolish waste of life , to spend it a we do , always wander up and down , and never come to any home at nightfall .
Our sister be lose , and never will be find .
She probably perish in the sea ; or , to whatever shore the white bull may have carry her , it be now so many year ago , that there would be neither love nor acquaintance between u , should we meet again .
My father have forbid u to return to his palace , so I shall build me a hut of branch , and dwell here . ''
`` Well , son Phoenix , '' say Telephassa , sorrowfully , `` you have grow to be a man , and must do a you judge best .
But , for my part , I will still go in quest of my poor child . ''
`` And we three will go along with you ! ''
cry Cadmus and Cilix , and their faithful friend Thasus .
But , before set out , they all help Phoenix to build a habitation .
When complete , it be a sweet rural bower , roof overhead with an arch of living bough .
Inside there be two pleasant room , one of which have a soft heap of moss for a bed , while the other be furnish with a rustic seat or two , curiously fashion out of the crooked root of tree .
So comfortable and home-like do it seem , that Telephassa and her three companion could not help sighing , to think that they must still roam about the world , instead of spend the remainder of their life in some such cheerful abode a they have here build for Phoenix .
But , when they bid him farewell , Phoenix shed tear , and probably regret that he be no long to keep them company .
However , he have fix upon an admirable place to dwell in .
And by and by there come other people , who chance to have no home ; and , see how pleasant a spot it be , they build themselves huts in the neighborhood of Phoenix 's habitation .
Thus , before many year go by , a city have grow up there , in the center of which be see a stately palace of marble , wherein dwell Phoenix , clothe in a purple robe , and wear a golden crown upon his head .
For the inhabitant of the new city , find that he have royal blood in his vein , have choose him to be their king .
The very first decree of state which King Phoenix issue be , that , if a maiden happen to arrive in the kingdom , mount on a snow-white bull , and call herself Europa , his subject should treat her with the great kindness and respect , and immediately bring her to the palace .
You may see , by this , that Phoenix 's conscience never quite cease to trouble him , for give up the quest of his dear sister , and sit himself down to be comfortable , while his mother and her companion go onward .
But often and often , at the close of a weary day 's journey , do Telephassa and Cadmus , Cilix , and Thasus , remember the pleasant spot in which they have leave Phoenix .
It be a sorrowful prospect for these wanderer , that on the morrow they must again set forth , and that , after many nightfall , they would perhaps be no nearer the close of their toilsome pilgrimage than now .
These thought make them all melancholy at time , but appear to torment Cilix more than the rest of the party .
At length , one morning , when they be take their staff in hand to set out , he thus address them : `` My dear mother , and you , good brother Cadmus , and my friend Thasus , methinks we be like people in a dream .
There be no substance in the life which we be lead .
It be such a dreary length of time since the white bull carry off my sister Europa , that I have quite forget how she look , and the tone of her voice , and , indeed , almost doubt whether such a little girl ever live in the world .
And whether she once live or no , I be convince that she no longer survive , and that therefore it be the mere folly to waste our own life and happiness in seek her .
Were we to find her , she would now be a woman grown , and would look upon u all a stranger .
So , to tell you the truth , I have resolve to take up my abode here ; and I entreat you , mother , brother , and friend , to follow my example . ''
`` Not I , for one , '' say Telephassa ; although the poor queen , firmly a she speak , be so travel-worn that she could hardly put her foot to the ground .
`` Not I , for one !
In the depth of my heart , little Europa be still the rosy child who run to gather flower so many year ago .
She have not grow to womanhood , nor forget me .
At noon , at night , journey onward , sit down to rest , her childish voice be always in my ear , call , ` Mother !
mother ! '
Stop here who may , there be no repose for me . ''
`` Nor for me , '' say Cadmus , `` while my dear mother plea to go onward . ''
And the faithful Thasus , too , be resolve to bear them company .
They remain with Cilix a few day , however , and help him to build a rustic bower , resemble the one which they have formerly build for Phoenix .
When they be bid him farewell Cilix burst into tear , and tell his mother that it seem just a melancholy a dream to stay there , in solitude , a to go onward .
If she really believe that they would ever find Europa , he be willing to continue the search with them , even now .
But Telephassa bid him remain there , and be happy , if his own heart would let him .
So the pilgrim take their leave of him , and depart , and be hardly out of sight before some other wandering people come along that way , and saw Cilix 's habitation , and be greatly delight with the appearance of the place .
There be abundance of unoccupied ground in the neighborhood , these stranger build hut for themselves , and be soon join by a multitude of new settler , who quickly form a city .
In the middle of it be see a magnificent palace of colored marble , on the balcony of which , every noontide , appear Cilix , in a long purple robe , and with a jeweled crown upon his head ; for the inhabitant , when they find out that he be a king 's son , have consider him the fit of all men to be a king himself .
One of the first act of King Cilix 's government be to send out an expedition , consist of a grave ambassador , and an escort of bold and hardy young men , with order to visit the principal kingdom of the earth , and inquire whether a young maiden have pass through those region , gallop swiftly on a white bull .
It be , therefore , plain to my mind , that Cilix secretly blame himself for give up the search for Europa , as long a he be able to put one foot before the other .
As for Telephassa , and Cadmus , and the good Thasus , it grieve me to think of them , still keep up that weary pilgrimage .
The two young men do their best for the poor queen , help her over the rough place , often carry her across rivulet in their faithful arm and seek to shelter her at nightfall , even when they themselves lay on the ground .
Sad , sad it be to hear them ask of every passer-by if he have see Europa , so long after the white bull have carry her away .
But , though the gray year thrust themselves between , and make the child 's figure dim in their remembrance , neither of these true-hearted three ever dream of give up the search .
One morning , however , poor Thasus find that he have sprain his ankle , and could not possibly go a step far .
`` After a few day , to be sure , '' say he , mournfully , `` I might make shift to hobble along with a stick .
But that would only delay you , and perhaps hinder you from find dear little Europa , after all your pain and trouble .
Do you go forward , therefore , my beloved companion , and leave me to follow a I may . ''
`` Thou hast be a true friend , dear Thasus , '' say Queen Telephassa , kiss his forehead .
`` Being neither my son , nor the brother of our lose Europa , thou hast show thyself truer to me and her than Phoenix and Cilix do , whom we have leave behind u .
Without thy loving help , and that of my son Cadmus , my limb could not have bear me half so far a this .
Now , take thy rest , and be at peace .
For -- and it be the first time I have own it to myself -- I begin to question whether we shall ever find my beloved daughter in this world . ''
Saying this , the poor queen shed tear , because it be a grievous trial to the mother 's heart to confess that her hope be grow faint .
From that day forward , Cadmus notice that she never travel with the same alacrity of spirit that have heretofore support her .
Her weight be heavy upon his arm .
Before set out , Cadmus help Thasus build a bower ; while Telephassa , be too infirm to give any great assistance , advise them how to fit it up and furnish it , so that it might be as comfortable a a hut of branch could .
Thasus , however , do not spend all his day in this green bower .
For it happen to him , a to Phoenix and Cilix , that other homeless people visit the spot , and like it , and build themselves habitation in the neighborhood .
So here , in the course of a few year , be another thriving city , with a red freestone palace in the center of it , where Thasus sit upon a throne , do justice to the people , with a purple robe over his shoulder , a sceptre in his hand , and a crown upon his head .
The inhabitant have make him king , not for the sake of any royal blood -LRB- for none be in his vein -RRB- , but because Thasus be an upright , true-hearted , and courageous man , and therefore fit to rule .
But when the affair of his kingdom be all settle , King Thasus lay aside his purple robe and crown , and sceptre , and bid his worthy subject distribute justice to the people in his stead .
Then , grasp the pilgrim 's staff that have support him so long , he set forth again , hop still to discover some hoof-mark of the snow-white bull , some trace of the vanished child .
He return after a lengthened absence , and sit down wearily upon his throne .
To his late hour , nevertheless , King Thasus show his true-hearted remembrance of Europa , by order that a fire should always be keep burn in his palace , and a bath steam hot , and food ready to be serve up , and a bed with snow-white sheet , in case the maiden should arrive , and require immediate refreshment .
And , though Europa never come , the good Thasus have the blessing of many a poor traveler , who profit by the food and lodging which be mean for the little playmate of the king 's boyhood .
Telephassa and Cadmus be now pursue their weary way , with no companion but each other .
The queen lean heavily upon her son 's arm , and could walk only a few mile a day .
But for all her weakness and weariness , she would not be persuade to give up the search .
It be enough to bring tear into the eye of bearded men to hear the melancholy tone with which she inquire of every stranger whether he could not tell her any news of the lose child .
`` Have you see a little girl -- no , no , I mean a young maiden of full growth -- passing by this way , mount on a snow-white bull , which gallop as swiftly a the wind ? ''
`` We have see no such wondrous sight , '' the people would reply ; and very often , take Cadmus aside , they whisper to him , `` Is this stately and sad-looking woman your mother ?
Surely she be not in her right mind ; and you ought to take her home , and make her comfortable , and do your best to get this dream out of her fancy . ''
`` It be no dream , '' say Cadmus .
`` Everything else be a dream , save that . ''
But , one day , Telephassa seem feeble than usual , and lean almost her whole weight on the arm of Cadmus , and walk more slowly than ever before .
At last they reach a solitary spot , where she tell her son that she must need lie down , and take a good long rest .
`` A good long rest ! ''
she repeat , look Cadmus tenderly in the face .
`` A good long rest , thou dear one ! ''
`` As long a you please , dear mother , '' answer Cadmus .
Telephassa bid him sit down on the turf beside her , and then she take his hand .
`` My son , '' say she , fix her dim eye most lovingly upon him , `` this rest that I speak of will be very long indeed !
You must not wait till it be finish .
Dear Cadmus , you do not comprehend me .
You must make a grave here , and lay your mother 's weary frame into it .
My pilgrimage be over . ''
Cadmus burst into tear , and , for a long time , refuse to believe that his dear mother be now to be take from him .
But Telephassa reason with him , and kiss him , and at length make him discern that it be well for her spirit to pass away out of the toil , the weariness , and grief , and disappointment which have burden her on earth , ever since the child be lose .
He therefore repress his sorrow , and listen to her last word .
`` Dearest Cadmus , '' say she , `` thou hast be the true son that ever mother have , and faithful to the very last .
Who else would have bear with my infirmity a thou hast !
It be owe to thy care , thou tender child , that my grave be not dug long year ago , in some valley , or on some hillside , that lie far , far behind u .
It be enough .
Thou shalt wander no more on this hopeless search .
But , when thou hast lay thy mother in the earth , then go , my son , to Delphi , and inquire of the oracle what thou shalt do next . ''
`` O mother , mother , '' cry Cadmus , `` couldst thou but have see my sister before this hour ! ''
`` It matter little now , '' answer Telephassa , and there be a smile upon her face .
`` I go now to the good world , and , sooner or later , shall find my daughter there . ''
I will not sadden you , my little hearer , with tell how Telephassa die and be bury , but will only say , that her die smile grow brighter , instead of vanish from her dead face ; so that Cadmus leave convinced that , at her very first step into the good world , she have catch Europa in her arm .
He plant some flower on his mother 's grave , and leave them to grow there , and make the place beautiful , when he should be far away .
After perform this last sorrowful duty , he set forth alone , and take the road towards the famous oracle of Delphi , a Telephassa have advise him .
On his way thither , he still inquire of most people whom he meet whether they have see Europa ; for , to say the truth , Cadmus have grow so accustomed to ask the question , that it come to his lip as readily a a remark about the weather .
He receive various answer .
Some tell him one thing , and some another .
Among the rest , a mariner affirm , that , many year before , in a distant country , he have hear a rumor about a white bull , which come swim across the sea with a child on his back , dress up in flower that be blight by the sea water .
He do not know what have become of the child or the bull ; and Cadmus suspect , indeed , by a queer twinkle in the mariner 's eye , that he be put a joke upon him , and have never really hear anything about the matter .
Poor Cadmus find it more wearisome to travel alone than to bear all his dear mother 's weight , while she have keep him company .
His heart , you will understand , be now so heavy that it seem impossible , sometimes , to carry it any farther .
But his limb be strong and active , and well accustom to exercise .
He walk swiftly along , think of King Agenor and Queen Telephassa , and his brother , and the friendly Thasus , all of whom he have leave behind him , at one point of his pilgrimage or another , and never expect to see them any more .
Full of these remembrance , he come within sight of a lofty mountain , which the people thereabouts tell him be call Parnassus .
On the slope of Mount Parnassus be the famous Delphi , whither Cadmus be go .
This Delphi be suppose to be the very midmost spot of the whole world .
The place of the oracle be a certain cavity in the mountain side , over which , when Cadmus come thither , he find a rude bower of branch .
It remind him of those which he have help to build for Phoenix and Cilix , and afterwards for Thasus .
In later time , when multitude of people come from great distance to put question to the oracle , a spacious temple of marble be erect over the spot .
But in the day of Cadmus , a I have tell you , there be only this rustic bower , with it abundance of green foliage , and a tuft of shrubbery , that run wild over the mysterious hole in the hillside .
When Cadmus have thrust a passage through the tangled bough , and make his way into the bower , he do not at first discern the half-hidden cavity .
But soon he felt a cold stream of air rush out of it , with so much force that it shake the ringlet on his cheek .
Pulling away the shrubbery which cluster over the hole , he bend forward , and speak in a distinct but reverential tone , a if address some unseen personage inside of the mountain .
`` Sacred oracle of Delphi , '' say he , `` whither shall I go next in quest of my dear sister Europa ? ''
There be at first a deep silence , and then a rush sound , or a noise like a long sigh , proceed out of the interior of the earth .
This cavity , you must know , be look upon a a sort of fountain of truth , which sometimes gush out in audible word ; although , for the most part , these word be such a riddle that they might just as well have staid at the bottom of the hole .
But Cadmus be more fortunate than many others who go to Delphi in search of truth .
By and by , the rush noise begin to sound like articulate language .
It repeat , over and over again , the following sentence , which , after all , be so like the vague whistle of a blast of air , that Cadmus really do not quite know whether it mean anything or not : `` Seek her no more !
Seek her no more !
Seek her no more ! ''
`` What , then , shall I do ? ''
ask Cadmus .
For , ever since he be a child , you know , it have be the great object of his life to find his sister .
From the very hour that he leave follow the butterfly in the meadow , near his father 's palace , he have do his best to follow Europa , over land and sea .
And now , if he must give up the search , he seem to have no more business in the world .
But again the sigh gust of air grow into something like a hoarse voice .
`` Follow the cow ! ''
it say .
`` Follow the cow !
Follow the cow ! ''
And when these word have be repeat until Cadmus be tire of hear them -LRB- especially a he could not imagine what cow it be , or why he be to follow her -RRB- , the gusty hole give vent to another sentence .
`` Where the stray cow lie down , there be your home . ''
These word be pronounce but a single time , and die away into a whisper before Cadmus be fully satisfied that he have catch the meaning .
He put other question , but receive no answer ; only the gust of wind sigh continually out of the cavity , and blow the withered leaf rustle along the ground before it .
`` Did there really come any word out of the hole ? ''
think Cadmus ; `` or have I be dream all this while ? ''
He turn away from the oracle , and think himself no wiser than when he come thither .
Caring little what might happen to him , he take the first path that offer itself , and go along at a sluggish pace ; for , have no object in view , nor any reason to go one way more than another , it would certainly have be foolish to make haste .
Whenever he meet anybody , the old question be at his tongue 's end .
`` Have you see a beautiful maiden , dress like a king 's daughter , and mount on a snow-white bull , that gallop as swiftly a the wind ? ''
But , remember what the oracle have say , he only half utter the word , and then mumble the rest indistinctly ; and from his confusion , people must have imagine that this handsome young man have lose his wit .
I know not how far Cadmus have go , nor could he himself have tell you , when at no great distance before him , he behold a brindled cow .
She be lie down by the wayside , and quietly chew her cud ; nor do she take any notice of the young man until he have approach pretty nigh .
Then , get leisurely upon her foot , and give her head a gentle toss , she begin to move along at a moderate pace , often pause just long enough to crop a mouthful of grass .
Cadmus loiter behind , whistle idly to himself , and scarcely notice the cow ; until the thought occur to him , whether this could possibly be the animal which , accord to the oracle 's response , be to serve him for a guide .
But he smile at himself for fancy such a thing .
He could not seriously think that this be the cow , because she go along so quietly , behave just like any other cow .
Evidently she neither know nor care so much a a wisp of hay about Cadmus , and be only think how to get her living along the wayside , where the herbage be green and fresh .
Perhaps she be go home to be milk .
`` Cow , cow , cow ! ''
cry Cadmus .
`` Hey , Brindle , hey !
Stop , my good cow ! ''
He want to come up with the cow , so a to examine her , and see if she would appear to know him , or whether there be any peculiarity to distinguish her from a thousand other cow , whose only business be to fill the milk-pail , and sometimes kick it over .
But still the brindled cow trudge on , whisk her tail to keep the fly away , and take as little notice of Cadmus a she well could .
If he walk slowly , so do the cow , and seize the opportunity to graze .
If he quicken his pace , the cow go just so much the faster ; and once , when Cadmus try to catch her by run , she throw out her heel , stick her tail straight on end , and set off at a gallop , look as queerly a cow generally do , while put themselves to their speed .
When Cadmus saw that it be impossible to come up with her , he walk on moderately , a before .
The cow , too , go leisurely on , without look behind .
Wherever the grass be green , there she nibble a mouthful or two .
Where a brook glisten brightly across the path , there the cow drank , and breathe a comfortable sigh , and drank again , and trudge onward at the pace that best suit herself and Cadmus .
`` I do believe , '' think Cadmus , `` that this may be the cow that be foretell me .
If it be the one , I suppose she will lie down somewhere hereabouts . ''
Whether it be the oracular cow or some other one , it do not seem reasonable that she should travel a great way farther .
So , whenever they reach a particularly pleasant spot on a breezy hillside , or in a sheltered vale , or flowery meadow , on the shore of a calm lake , or along the bank of a clear stream , Cadmus look eagerly around to see if the situation would suit him for a home .
But still , whether he like the place or no , the brindled cow never offer to lie down .
On she go at the quiet pace of a cow go homeward to the barn yard ; and , every moment , Cadmus expect to see a milkmaid approach with a pail , or a herdsman running to head the stray animal , and turn her back towards the pasture .
But no milkmaid come ; no herdsman drive her back ; and Cadmus follow the stray Brindle till he be almost ready to drop down with fatigue .
`` O brindled cow , '' cry he , in a tone of despair , `` do you never mean to stop ? ''
He have now grow too intent on follow her to think of lag behind , however long the way , and whatever might be his fatigue .
Indeed , it seem a if there be something about the animal that bewitch people .
Several person who happen to see the brindled cow , and Cadmus follow behind , begin to trudge after her , precisely a he do .
Cadmus be glad of somebody to converse with , and therefore talk very freely to these good people .
He tell them all his adventure , and how he have leave King Agenor in his palace , and Phoenix at one place , and Cilix at another , and Thasus at a third , and his dear mother , Queen Telephassa , under a flowery sod ; so that now he be quite alone , both friendless and homeless .
He mention , likewise , that the oracle have bid him be guide by a cow , and inquire of the stranger whether they suppose that this brindled animal could be the one .
`` Why , 't be a very wonderful affair , '' answer one of his new companion .
`` I be pretty well acquaint with the way of cattle , and I never know a cow , of her own accord , to go so far without stop .
If my leg will let me , I 'll never leave follow the beast till she lie down . ''
`` Nor I ! ''
say a second .
`` Nor I ! ''
cry a third .
`` If she go a hundred mile far , I be determine to see the end of it . ''
The secret of it be , you must know , that the cow be an enchanted cow , and that , without their be conscious of it , she throw some of her enchantment over everybody that take so much a half a dozen step behind her .
They could not possibly help follow her , though all the time they fancy themselves do it of their own accord .
The cow be by no mean very nice in choose her path ; so that sometimes they have to scramble over rock , or wade through mud and mire , and all in a terribly bedraggle condition , and tire to death , and very hungry , into the bargain .
What a weary business it be !
But still they keep trudge stoutly forward , and talk a they go .
The stranger grow very fond of Cadmus , and resolve never to leave him , but to help him build a city wherever the cow might lie down .
In the center of it there should be a noble palace , in which Cadmus might dwell , and be their king , with a throne , a crown , a sceptre , a purple robe , and everything else that a king ought to have ; for in him there be the royal blood , and the royal heart , and the head that know how to rule .
While they be talk of these scheme , and beguile the tediousness of the way with lay out the plan of the new city , one of the company happen to look at the cow .
`` Joy !
joy ! ''
cry he , clap his hand .
`` Brindle be go to lie down . ''
They all look ; and , sure enough , the cow have stop , and be star leisurely about her , a other cow do when on the point of lie down .
And slowly , slowly do she recline herself on the soft grass , first bend her foreleg , and then crouch her hind one .
When Cadmus and his companion come up with her , there be the brindled cow take her ease , chew her cud , and look them quietly in the face ; a if this be just the spot she have be seek for , and a if it be all a matter of course .
`` This , then , '' say Cadmus , gaze around him , `` this be to be my home . ''
It be a fertile and lovely plain , with great tree fling their sun-speckled shadow over it , and hill fence it in from the rough weather At no great distance , they behold a river gleaming in the sunshine .
A home feeling stole into the heart of poor Cadmus .
He be very glad to know that here he might awake in the morning without the necessity of put on his dusty sandal to travel far and far .
The day and the year would pass over him , and find him still in this pleasant spot .
If he could have have his brother with him , and his friend Thasus , and could have see his dear mother under a roof of his own , he might here have be happy after all their disappointment .
Some day or other , too , his sister Europa might have come quietly to the door of his home , and smile round upon the familiar face .
But , indeed , since there be no hope of regain the friend of his boyhood , or ever see his dear sister again , Cadmus resolve to make himself happy with these new companion , who have grow so fond of him while follow the cow .
`` Yes , my friend , '' say he to them , `` this be to be our home .
Here we will build our habitation .
The brindled cow , which have lead u hither , will supply u with milk .
We will cultivate the neighboring soil and lead an innocent and happy life . ''
His companion joyfully assent to this plan ; and , in the first place , be very hungry and thirsty , they look about them for the mean of provide a comfortable meal .
Not far off they saw a tuft of tree , which appear a if there might be a spring of water beneath them .
They go thither to fetch some , leave Cadmus stretch on the ground along with the brindled cow ; for , now that he have find a place of rest , it seem a if all the weariness of his pilgrimage , ever since he leave King Agenor 's palace , have fall upon him at once .
But his new friend have not long be go , when he be suddenly startle by cry , shout , and scream , and the noise of a terrible struggle , and in the midst of it all , a most awful hissing , which go right through his ear like a rough saw .
Running towards the tuft of tree , he behold the head and fiery eye of an immense serpent or dragon , with the wide jaw that ever a dragon have , and a vast many row of horribly sharp teeth .
Before Cadmus could reach the spot , this pitiless reptile have kill his poor companion , and be busily devour them , make but a mouthful of each man .
It appear that the fountain of water be enchant , and that the dragon have be set to guard it , so that no mortal might ever quench his thirst there .
As the neighboring inhabitant carefully avoid the spot , it be now a long time -LRB- not less than a hundred year or thereabouts -RRB- since the monster have break his fast ; and , a be natural enough , his appetite have grow to be enormous , and be not half satisfy by the poor people whom he have just eat up .
When he catch sight of Cadmus , therefore , he set up another abominable hiss , and fling back his immense jaw , until his mouth look like a great red cavern , at the farther end of which be see the leg of his last victim , whom he have hardly have time to swallow .
But Cadmus be so enrage at the destruction of his friend that he care neither for the size of the dragon 's jaw nor for his hundred of sharp teeth .
Drawing his sword , he rush at the monster , and fling himself right into his cavernous mouth .
This bold method of attack him take the dragon by surprise ; for , in fact , Cadmus have leap so far down into his throat , that the row of terrible teeth could not close upon him , nor do him the least harm in the world .
Thus , though the struggle be a tremendous one , and though the dragon shatter the tuft of tree into small splinter by the lashing of his tail , yet , a Cadmus be all the while slash and stab at his very vitals , it be not long before the scaly wretch bethink himself of slip away .
He have not go his length , however , when the brave Cadmus give him a sword thrust that finish the battle ; and creep out of the gateway of the creature 's jaw , there he behold him still wriggle his vast bulk , although there be no longer life enough in him to harm a little child .
But do not you suppose that it make Cadmus sorrowful to think of the melancholy fate which have befall those poor , friendly people , who have follow the cow along with him ?
It seem a if he be doom to lose everybody whom he love , or to see them perish in one way or another .
And here he be , after all his toil and trouble , in a solitary place , with not a single human be to help him build a hut .
`` What shall I do ? ''
cry he aloud .
`` It be good for me to have be devour by the dragon , a my poor companion be . ''
`` Cadmus , '' say a voice but whether it come from above or below him , or whether it speak within his own breast , the young man could not tell -- `` Cadmus , pluck out the dragon 's teeth , and plant them in the earth . ''
This be a strange thing to do ; nor be it very easy , I should imagine , to dig out all those deep-rooted fang from the dead dragon 's jaw .
But Cadmus toil and tug , and after pound the monstrous head almost to piece with a great stone , he at last collect a many teeth a might have fill a bushel or two .
The next thing be to plant them .
This , likewise , be a tedious piece of work , especially a Cadmus be already exhaust with kill the dragon and knock his head to piece , and have nothing to dig the earth with , that I know of , unless it be his sword blade .
Finally , however , a sufficiently large tract of ground be turn up , and sown with this new kind of seed ; although half of the dragon 's teeth still remain to be plant some other day .
Cadmus , quite out of breath , stand lean upon his sword , and wonder what be to happen next .
He have wait but a few moment , when he begin to see a sight , which be a great a marvel a the most marvelous thing I ever tell you about .
The sun be shin slantwise over the field , and show all the moist , dark soil just like any other newly-planted piece of ground .
All at once , Cadmus fancy he saw something glisten very brightly , first at one spot , then at another , and then at a hundred and a thousand spot together .
Soon he perceive them to be the steel head of spear , sprout up everywhere like so many stalk of grain , and continually grow taller and taller .
Next appear a vast number of bright sword blade , thrust themselves up in the same way .
A moment afterwards , the whole surface of the ground be break by a multitude of polished brass helmet , come up like a crop of enormous bean .
So rapidly do they grow , that Cadmus now discern the fierce countenance of a man beneath every one .
In short , before he have time to think what a wonderful affair it be , he behold an abundant harvest of what look like human being , arm with helmet and breastplate , shield , sword , and spear ; and before they be well out of the earth , they brandish their weapon , and clash them one against another , seem to think , little while a they have yet live , that they have waste too much of life without a battle .
Every tooth of the dragon have produce one of these son of deadly mischief .
Up sprout also a great many trumpeter ; and with the first breath that they draw , they put their brazen trumpet to their lip , and sound a tremendous and ear-shattering blast , so that the whole space , just now so quiet and solitary , reverberate with the clash and clang of arm , the bray of warlike music , and the shout of angry men .
So enrage do they all look , that Cadmus fully expect them to put the whole world to the sword .
How fortunate would it be for a great conqueror , if he could get a bushel of the dragon 's teeth to sow !
`` Cadmus , '' say the same voice which he have before heard , `` throw a stone into the midst of the arm men . ''
So Cadmus seize a large stone , and fling it into the middle of the earth army , saw it strike the breastplate of a gigantic and fierce-looking warrior .
Immediately on feel the blow , he seem to take it for grant that somebody have strike him ; and , uplift his weapon , he smite his next neighbor a blow that cleave his helmet asunder , and stretch him on the ground .
In an instant , those near the fall warrior begin to strike at one another with their sword , and stab with their spear .
The confusion spread wider and wider .
Each man smite down his brother , and be himself smite down before he have time to exult in his victory .
The trumpeter , all the while , blow their blast shriller and shriller ; each soldier shout a battle cry , and often fell with it on his lip .
It be the strange spectacle of causeless wrath , and of mischief for no good end , that have ever be witness ; but , after all , it be neither more foolish nor more wicked than a thousand battle that have since be fight , in which men have slay their brother with just a little reason a these child of the dragon 's teeth .
It ought to be consider , too , that the dragon people be make for nothing else ; whereas other mortal be bear to love and help one another .
Well , this memorable battle continue to rage until the ground be strew with helmeted head that have be cut off .
Of all the thousand that begin the fight , there be only five leave standing .
These now rush from different part of the field , and , meeting in the middle of it , clash their sword , and strike at each other 's heart as fiercely a ever .
`` Cadmus , '' say the voice again , `` bid those five warrior sheathe their sword .
They will help you to build the city . ''
Without hesitate an instant , Cadmus step forward , with the aspect of a king and a leader , and extend his drawn sword amongst them , speak to the warrior in a stern and commanding voice .
`` Sheathe your weapon ! ''
say he .
And forthwith , feel themselves bound to obey him , the five remain son of the dragon 's teeth make him a military salute with their sword , return them to the scabbard , and stand before Cadmus in a rank , eye him a soldier eye their captain , while await the word of command .
These five men have probably spring from the big of the dragon 's teeth , and be the bold and strong of the whole army .
They be almost giant indeed , and have good need to be so , else they never could have live through so terrible a fight .
They still have a very furious look , and , if Cadmus happen to glance aside , would glare at one another , with fire flash out of their eye .
It be strange , too , to observe how the earth , out of which they have so lately grown , be incrust , here and there , on their bright breastplate , and even , begrime their face ; just a you may have see it cling to beet and carrot , when pull out of their native soil .
Cadmus hardly know whether to consider them a men , or some odd kind of vegetable ; although , on the whole , he conclude that there be human nature in them , because they be so fond of trumpet and weapon , and so ready to shed blood .
They look him earnestly in the face , wait for his next order , and evidently desire no other employment than to follow him from one battlefield to another , all over the wide world .
But Cadmus be wise than these earth-born creature , with the dragon 's fierceness in them , and know good how to use their strength and hardihood .
`` Come ! ''
say he .
`` You be sturdy fellow .
Make yourselves useful !
Quarry some stone with those great sword of yours , and help me to build a city . ''
The five soldier grumble a little , and mutter that it be their business to overthrow city , not to build them up .
But Cadmus look at them with a stern eye , and speak to them in a tone of authority , so that they know him for their master , and never again thought of disobey his command .
They set to work in good earnest , and toil so diligently , that , in a very short time , a city begin to make it appearance .
At first , to be sure , the workman show a quarrelsome disposition .
Like savage beast , they would doubtless have do one another a mischief , if Cadmus have not keep watch over them , and quell the fierce old serpent that lurk in their heart , when he saw it gleam out of their wild eye .
But , in course of time , they get accustom to honest labor , and have sense enough to feel that there be more true enjoyment in living at peace , and do good to one 's neighbor , than in strike at him with a two-edged sword .
It may not be too much to hope that the rest of mankind will by and by grow a wise and peaceable a these five earth-begrimed warrior , who spring from the dragon 's teeth .
And now the city be build , and there be a home in it for each of the workman .
But the palace of Cadmus be not yet erect , because they have leave it till the last , mean to introduce all the new improvement of architecture , and make it very commodious , as well a stately and beautiful .
After finish the rest of their labor , they all go to bed betimes , in order to rise in the gray of the morning , and get at least the foundation of the edifice lay before nightfall .
But , when Cadmus arose , and take his way towards the site where the palace be to be build , follow by his five sturdy workman march all in a row , what do you think he saw ?
What should it be but the most magnificent palace that have ever be see in the world .
It be build of marble and other beautiful kind of stone , and rise high into the air , with a splendid dome and a portico along the front , and carve pillar , and everything else that befit the habitation of a mighty king .
It have grow up out of the earth in almost a short a time a it have take the armed host to spring from the dragon 's teeth ; and what make the matter more strange , no seed of this stately edifice ever have be plant .
When the five workman behold the dome , with the morning sunshine make it look golden and glorious , they give a great shout .
`` Long live King Cadmus , '' they cry , `` in his beautiful palace . ''
And the new king , with his five faithful follower at his heel , shoulder their pickax and march in a rank -LRB- for they still have a soldier-like sort of behavior , a their nature be -RRB- , ascend the palace step .
Halting at the entrance , they gaze through a long vista of lofty pillar , that be range from end to end of a great hall .
At the farther extremity of this hall , approach slowly towards him , Cadmus behold a female figure , wonderfully beautiful , and adorn with a royal robe , and a crown of diamond over her golden ringlet , and the rich necklace that ever a queen wore .
His heart thrill with delight .
He fancy it his long-lost sister Europa , now grow to womanhood , come to make him happy , and to repay him with her sweet sisterly affection , for all those weary wonderings in quest of her since he leave King Agenor 's palace -- for the tear that he have shed , on part with Phoenix , and Cilix , and Thasus -- for the heart-breakings that have make the whole world seem dismal to him over his dear mother 's grave .
But , a Cadmus advance to meet the beautiful stranger , he saw that her feature be unknown to him , although , in the little time that it require to tread along the hall , he have already felt a sympathy betwixt himself and her .
`` No , Cadmus , '' say the same voice that have speak to him in the field of the arm men , `` this be not that dear sister Europa whom you have seek so faithfully all over the wide world .
This be Harmonia , a daughter of the sky , who be give you instead of sister , and brother , and friend , and mother .
You will find all those dear one in her alone . ''
So King Cadmus dwelt in the palace , with his new friend Harmonia , and find a great deal of comfort in his magnificent abode , but would doubtless have find a much , if not more , in the humble cottage by the wayside .
Before many year go by , there be a group of rosy little child -LRB- but how they come thither have always be a mystery to me -RRB- sport in the great hall , and on the marble step of the palace , and run joyfully to meet King Cadmus when affair of state leave him at leisure to play with them .
They call him father , and Queen Harmonia mother .
The five old soldier of the dragon 's teeth grow very fond of these small urchin , and be never weary of show them how to shoulder stick , flourish wooden sword , and march in military order , blow a penny trumpet , or beat an abominable rub-a-dub upon a little drum .
But King Cadmus , l there should be too much of the dragon 's tooth in his child 's disposition , use to find time from his kingly duty to teach them their A B C -- which he invent for their benefit , and for which many little people , I be afraid , be not half so grateful to him a they ought to be .
CIRCE 'S PALACE .
Some of you have hear , no doubt , of the wise King Ulysses , and how he go to the siege of Troy , and how , after that famous city be take and burn , he spend ten long year in try to get back again to his own little kingdom of Ithaca .
At one time in the course of this weary voyage , he arrive at an island that look very green and pleasant , but the name of which be unknown to him .
For , only a little while before he come thither , he have meet with a terrible hurricane , or rather a great many hurricane at once , which drive his fleet of vessel into a strange part of the sea , where neither himself nor any of his mariner have ever sail .
This misfortune be entirely owe to the foolish curiosity of his shipmate , who , while Ulysses lay asleep , have untie some very bulky leathern bag , in which they suppose a valuable treasure to be conceal .
But in each of these stout bag , King Aeolus , the ruler of the wind , have tie up a tempest , and have give it to Ulysses to keep in order that he might be sure of a favorable passage homeward to Ithaca ; and when the string be loosen , forth rush the whistling blast , like air out of a blown bladder , whiten the sea with foam , and scatter the vessel nobody could tell whither .
Immediately after escape from this peril , a still great one have befall him .
Scudding before the hurricane , he reach a place , which , a he afterwards find , be call Laestrygonia , where some monstrous giant have eat up many of his companion , and have sink every one of his vessel , except that in which he himself sail , by fling great mass of rock at them , from the cliff along the shore .
After go through such trouble a these , you can not wonder that King Ulysses be glad to moor his tempest-beaten bark in a quiet cove of the green island , which I begin with tell you about .
But he have encounter so many danger from giant , and one-eyed Cyclops , and monster of the sea and land , that he could not help dread some mischief , even in this pleasant and seemingly solitary spot .
For two day , therefore , the poor weather-worn voyager keep quiet , and either staid on board of their vessel , or merely crept along under the cliff that border the shore ; and to keep themselves alive , they dig shellfish out of the sand , and seek for any little rill of fresh water that might be run towards the sea .
Before the two day be spend , they grow very weary of this kind of life ; for the follower of King Ulysses , a you will find it important to remember , be terrible gormandizers , and pretty sure to grumble if they miss their regular meal , and their irregular one besides .
Their stock of provision be quite exhaust , and even the shellfish begin to get scarce , so that they have now to choose between starve to death or venture into the interior of the island , where perhaps some huge three-headed dragon , or other horrible monster , have his den .
Such misshapen creature be very numerous in those day ; and nobody ever expect to make a voyage , or take a journey , without run more or less risk of be devour by them .
But King Ulysses be a bold man as well a a prudent one ; and on the third morning he determine to discover what sort of a place the island be , and whether it be possible to obtain a supply of food for the hungry mouth of his companion .
So , take a spear in his hand , he clamber to the summit of a cliff , and gaze round about him .
At a distance , towards the center of the island , he behold the stately tower of what seem to be a palace , build of snow-white marble , and rise in the midst of a grove of lofty tree .
The thick branch of these tree stretch across the front of the edifice , and more than half conceal it , although , from the portion which he saw , Ulysses judge it to be spacious and exceedingly beautiful , and probably the residence of some great nobleman or prince .
A blue smoke go curl up from the chimney , and be almost the pleasant part of the spectacle to Ulysses .
For , from the abundance of this smoke , it be reasonable to conclude that there be a good fire in the kitchen , and that , at dinner-time , a plentiful banquet would be serve up to the inhabitant of the palace , and to whatever guest might happen to drop in .
With so agreeable a prospect before him , Ulysses fancy that he could not do good than go straight to the palace gate , and tell the master of it that there be a crew of poor shipwrecked mariner , not far off , who have eat nothing for a day or two , save a few clam and oyster , and would therefore be thankful for a little food .
And the prince or nobleman must be a very stingy curmudgeon , to be sure , if , at least , when his own dinner be over , he would not bid them welcome to the broken victual from the table .
Pleasing himself with this idea , King Ulysses have make a few step in the direction of the palace , when there be a great twittering and chirp from the branch of a neighboring tree .
A moment afterwards , a bird come fly towards him , and hover in the air , so a almost to brush his face with it wing .
It be a very pretty little bird , with purple wing and body , and yellow leg , and a circle of golden feather round it neck , and on it head a golden tuft , which look like a king 's crown in miniature .
Ulysses try to catch the bird .
But it flutter nimbly out of his reach , still chirp in a piteous tone , a if it could have tell a lamentable story , have it only be gift with human language .
And when he attempt to drive it away , the bird fly no farther than the bough of the next tree , and again come flutter about his head , with it doleful chirp , as soon a he show a purpose of go forward .
`` Have you anything to tell me , little bird ? ''
ask Ulysses .
And he be ready to listen attentively to whatever the bird might communicate ; for , at the siege of Troy , and elsewhere , he have know such odd thing to happen , that he would not have consider it much out of the common run have this little feathered creature talk as plainly a himself .
`` Peep ! ''
say the bird , `` peep , peep , pe -- weep ! ''
And nothing else would it say , but only , `` Peep , peep , pe -- weep ! ''
in a melancholy cadence , and over and over and over again .
As often a Ulysses move forward , however , the bird show the great alarm , and do it best to drive him back , with the anxious flutter of it purple wing .
Its unaccountable behavior make him conclude , at last , that the bird knew of some danger that await him , and which must need be very terrible , beyond all question , since it move even a little fowl to feel compassion for a human be .
So he resolve , for the present , to return to the vessel , and tell his companion what he have see .
This appear to satisfy the bird .
As soon a Ulysses turn back , it run up the trunk of a tree , and begin to pick insect out of the bark with it long , sharp bill ; for it be a kind of woodpecker , you must know , and have to get it living in the same manner a other bird of that specie .
But every little while , a it peck at the bark of the tree , the purple bird bethink itself of some secret sorrow , and repeat it plaintive note of `` Peep , peep , pe -- weep ! ''
On his way to the shore , Ulysses have the good luck to kill a large stag by thrust his spear into his back .
Taking it on his shoulder -LRB- for he be a remarkably strong man -RRB- , he lug it along with him , and fling it down before his hungry companion .
I have already hint to you what gormandizers some of the comrade of King Ulysses be .
From what be relate of them , I reckon that their favorite diet be pork , and that they have live upon it until a good part of their physical substance be swine 's flesh , and their temper and disposition be very much akin to the hog .
A dish of venison , however , be no unacceptable meal to them , especially after feed so long on oyster and clam .
So , behold the dead stag , they felt of it rib , in a knowing way , and lose no time in kindle a fire of driftwood , to cook it .
The rest of the day be spend in feasting ; and if these enormous eater get up from table at sunset , it be only because they could not scrape another morsel off the poor animal 's bone .
The next morning , their appetite be as sharp a ever .
They look at Ulysses , a if they expect him to clamber up the cliff again , and come back with another fat deer upon his shoulder .
Instead of set out , however , he summon the whole crew together , and tell them it be in vain to hope that he could kill a stag every day for their dinner , and therefore it be advisable to think of some other mode of satisfy their hunger .
`` Now , '' say he , `` when I be on the cliff , yesterday , I discover that this island be inhabit .
At a considerable distance from the shore stand a marble palace , which appear to be very spacious , and have a great deal of smoke curl out of one of it chimney . ''
`` Aha ! ''
mutter some of his companion , smack their lip .
`` That smoke must have come from the kitchen fire .
There be a good dinner on the spit ; and no doubt there will be as good a one to-day . ''
`` But , '' continue the wise Ulysses , `` you must remember , my good friend , our misadventure in the cavern of one-eyed Polyphemus , the Cyclops !
Instead of his ordinary milk diet , do he not eat up two of our comrade for his supper , and a couple more for breakfast , and two at his supper again ?
Methinks I see him yet , the hideous monster , scan u with that great red eye , in the middle of his forehead , to single out the fattest .
And then , again , only a few day ago , do we not fall into the hand of the king of the Laestrygons , and those other horrible giant , his subject , who devour a great many more of u than be now leave ?
To tell you the truth , if we go to yonder palace , there can be no question that we shall make our appearance at the dinner table ; but whether seat a guest , or serve up a food , be a point to be seriously consider . ''
`` Either way , '' murmur some of the hungriest of the crew ; `` it will be good than starvation ; particularly if one could be sure of be well fatten beforehand , and daintily cook afterwards . ''
`` That be a matter of taste , '' say King Ulysses , `` and , for my own part , neither the most careful fattening nor the dainty of cookery would reconcile me to be dish at last .
My proposal be , therefore , that we divide ourselves into two equal party , and ascertain , by draw lot , which of the two shall go to the palace , and beg for food and assistance .
If these can be obtain , all be well .
If not , and if the inhabitant prove as inhospitable a Polyphemus , or the Laestrygons , then there will but half of u perish , and the remainder may set sail and escape . ''
As nobody object to this scheme , Ulysses proceed to count the whole band , and find that there be forty-six men , include himself .
He then number off twenty-two of them , and put Eurylochus -LRB- who be one of his chief officer , and second only to himself in sagacity -RRB- at their head .
Ulysses take command of the remain twenty-two men , in person .
Then , take off his helmet , he put two shell into it , on one of which be write , `` Go , '' and on the other `` Stay . ''
Another person now hold the helmet , while Ulysses and Eurylochus draw out each a shell ; and the word `` Go '' be find write on that which Eurylochus have draw .
In this manner , it be decide that Ulysses and his twenty-two men be to remain at the seaside until the other party should have find out what sort of treatment they might expect at the mysterious palace .
As there be no help for it , Eurylochus immediately set forth at the head of his twenty-two follower , who go off in a very melancholy state of mind , leave their friend in hardly good spirit than themselves .
No sooner have they clamber up the cliff , than they discern the tall marble tower of the palace , ascend , as white a snow , out of the lovely green shadow of the tree which surround it .
A gush of smoke come from a chimney in the rear of the edifice .
This vapor rise high in the air , and , meet with a breeze , be waft seaward , and make to pass over the head of the hungry mariner .
When people 's appetite be keen , they have a very quick scent for anything savory in the wind .
`` That smoke come from the kitchen ! ''
cried one of them , turn up his nose as high a he could , and snuff eagerly .
`` And , as sure a I 'm a half-starved vagabond , I smell roast meat in it . ''
`` Pig , roast pig ! ''
say another .
`` Ah , the dainty little porker .
My mouth water for him . ''
`` Let u make haste , '' cry the others , `` or we shall be too late for the good cheer ! ''
But scarcely have they make half a dozen step from the edge of the cliff , when a bird come flutter to meet them .
It be the same pretty little bird , with the purple wing and body , the yellow leg , the golden collar round it neck , and the crown-like tuft upon it head , whose behavior have so much surprised Ulysses .
It hover about Eurylochus , and almost brush his face with it wing .
`` Peep , peep , pe -- weep ! ''
chirp the bird .
So plaintively intelligent be the sound , that it seem a if the little creature be go to break it heart with some mighty secret that it have to tell , and only this one poor note to tell it with .
`` My pretty bird , '' say Eurylochus -- for he be a wary person , and let no token of harm escape his notice -- `` my pretty bird , who send you hither ?
And what be the message which you bring ? ''
`` Peep , peep , pe -- weep ! ''
reply the bird , very sorrowfully .
Then it fly towards the edge of the cliff , and look around at them , a if exceedingly anxious that they should return whence they come .
Eurylochus and a few of the others be incline to turn back .
They could not help suspect that the purple bird must be aware of something mischievous that would befall them at the palace , and the knowledge of which affect it airy spirit with a human sympathy and sorrow .
But the rest of the voyager , snuff up the smoke from the palace kitchen , ridicule the idea of return to the vessel .
One of them -LRB- more brutal than his fellow , and the most notorious gormandizer in the crew -RRB- say such a cruel and wicked thing , that I wonder the mere thought do not turn him into a wild beast , in shape , a he already be in his nature .
`` This troublesome and impertinent little fowl , '' say he , `` would make a delicate titbit to begin dinner with .
Just one plump morsel , melt away between the teeth .
If he come within my reach , I 'll catch him , and give him to the palace cook to be roast on a skewer . ''
The word be hardly out of his mouth , before the purple bird fly away , cry , `` Peep , peep , pe -- weep , '' more dolorously than ever .
`` That bird , '' remark Eurylochus , `` know more than we do about what await u at the palace . ''
`` Come on , then , '' cry his comrade , `` and we 'll soon know as much a he do . ''
The party , accordingly , go onward through the green and pleasant wood .
Every little while they catch new glimpse of the marble palace , which look more and more beautiful the nearer they approach it .
They soon enter a broad pathway , which seem to be very neatly keep , and which go wind along , with streak of sunshine fall across it and speck of light quiver among the deep shadow that fell from the lofty tree .
It be border , too , with a great many sweet-smelling flower , such a the mariner have never see before .
So rich and beautiful they be , that , if the shrub grow wild here , and be native in the soil , then this island be surely the flower garden of the whole earth ; or , if transplant from some other clime , it must have be from the Happy Islands that lay towards the golden sunset .
`` There have be a great deal of pain foolishly waste on these flower , '' observe one of the company ; and I tell you what he say , that you may keep in mind what gormandizers they be .
`` For my part , if I be the owner of the palace , I would bid my gardener cultivate nothing but savory pot herb to make a stuffing for roast meat , or to flavor a stew with . ''
`` Well say ! ''
cry the others .
`` But I 'll warrant you there 's a kitchen garden in the rear of the palace . ''
At one place they come to a crystal spring , and pause to drink at it for want of liquor which they like well .
Looking into it bosom , they behold their own face dimly reflect , but so extravagantly distort by the gush and motion of the water , that each one of them appear to be laugh at himself and all his companion .
So ridiculous be these image of themselves , indeed , that they do really laugh aloud , and could hardly be grave again as soon a they wish .
And after they have drink , they grow still merry than before .
`` It have a twang of the wine cask in it , '' say one , smack his lip .
`` Make haste ! ''
cry his fellow : `` we 'll find the wine cask itself at the palace , and that will be good than a hundred crystal fountain . ''
Then they quicken their pace , and caper for joy at the thought of the savory banquet at which they hop to be guest .
But Eurylochus tell them that he felt a if he be walk in a dream .
`` If I be really awake , '' continue he , `` then , in my opinion , we be on the point of meeting with some stranger adventure than any that befall u in the cave of Polyphemus , or among the gigantic man-eating Laestrygons , or in the windy palace of King Aeolus , which stand on a brazen-walled island .
This kind of dreamy feeling always come over me before any wonderful occurrence .
If you take my advice , you will turn back . ''
`` No , no , '' answer his comrade , snuff the air , in which the scent from the palace kitchen be now very perceptible .
`` We would not turn back , though we be certain that the king of the Laestrygons , as big a a mountain , would sit at the head of the table , and huge Polyphemus , the one-eyed Cyclops , at it foot . ''
At length they come within full sight of the palace , which prove to be very large and lofty , with a great number of airy pinnacle upon it roof .
Though it be midday , and the sun shone brightly over the marble front , yet it snowy whiteness , and it fantastic style of architecture , make it look unreal , like the frost work on a window pane , or like the shape of castle which one see among the cloud by moonlight .
But , just then , a puff of wind bring down the smoke of the kitchen chimney among them , and cause each man to smell the odor of the dish that he like best ; and , after scent it , they think everything else moonshine , and nothing real save this palace , and save the banquet that be evidently ready to be serve up in it .
So they hasten their step towards the portal , but have not get half way across the wide lawn , when a pack of lion , tiger , and wolf come bound to meet them .
The terrified mariner start back , expect no good fate than to be tear to piece and devour .
To their surprise and joy , however , these wild beast merely caper around them , wag their tail , offer their head to be stroke and pat , and behave just like so many well-bred house dog , when they wish to express their delight at meet their master , or their master 's friend .
The big lion lick the foot of Eurylochus ; and every other lion , and every wolf and tiger , single out one of his two and twenty follower , whom the beast fondle a if he love him good than a beef bone .
But , for all that , Eurylochus imagine that he saw something fierce and savage in their eye ; nor would he have be surprise , at any moment , to feel the big lion 's terrible claw , or to see each of the tiger make a deadly spring , or each wolf leap at the throat of the man whom he have fondle .
Their mildness seem unreal , and a mere freak ; but their savage nature be as true a their teeth and claw .
Nevertheless , the men go safely across the lawn with the wild beast frisk about them , and do no manner of harm ; although , a they mount the step of the palace , you might possibly have hear a low growl , particularly from the wolf ; a if they think it a pity , after all , to let the stranger pass without so much a taste what they be make of .
Eurylochus and his follower now pass under a lofty portal , and look through the open doorway into the interior of the palace .
The first thing that they saw be a spacious hall , and a fountain in the middle of it , gush up towards the ceiling out of a marble basin , and fall back into it with a continual plash .
The water of this fountain , a it spout upward , be constantly take new shape , not very distinctly , but plainly enough for a nimble fancy to recognize what they be .
Now it be the shape of a man in a long robe , the fleecy whiteness of which be make out of the fountain 's spray ; now it be a lion , or a tiger , or a wolf , or an as , or , as often a anything else , a hog , wallow in the marble basin a if it be his sty .
It be either magic or some very curious machinery that cause the gush waterspout to assume all these form .
But , before the stranger have time to look closely at this wonderful sight , their attention be draw off by a very sweet and agreeable sound .
A woman 's voice be sing melodiously in another room of the palace , and with her voice be mingle the noise of a loom , at which she be probably seat , weave a rich texture of cloth , and intertwine the high and low sweetness of her voice into a rich tissue of harmony .
By and by , the song come to an end ; and then , all at once , there be several feminine voice , talk airily and cheerfully , with now and then a merry burst of laughter , such a you may always hear when three or four young woman sit at work together .
`` What a sweet song that be ! ''
exclaim one of the voyager .
`` Too sweet , indeed , '' answer Eurylochus , shake his head .
`` Yet it be not so sweet a the song of the Sirens , those bird-like damsel who want to tempt u on the rock , so that our vessel might be wreck , and our bone leave whiten along the shore . ''
`` But just listen to the pleasant voice of those maiden , and that buzz of the loom , a the shuttle pass to and fro , '' say another comrade .
`` What a domestic , household , home-like sound it be !
Ah , before that weary siege of Troy , I use to hear the buzzing loom and the woman 's voice under my own roof .
Shall I never hear them again ?
nor taste those nice little savory dish which my dear wife know how to serve up ? ''
`` Tush !
we shall fare well here , '' say another .
`` But how innocently those woman be babble together , without guess that we overhear them !
And mark that rich voice of all , so pleasant and so familiar , but which yet seem to have the authority of a mistress among them .
Let u show ourselves at once .
What harm can the lady of the palace and her maiden do to mariner and warrior like u ? ''
`` Remember , '' say Eurylochus , `` that it be a young maiden who beguile three of our friend into the palace of the king of the Laestrygons , who eat up one of them in the twinkling of an eye . ''
No warning or persuasion , however , have any effect on his companion .
They go up to a pair of fold door at the farther end of the hall , and throw them wide open , pass into the next room .
Eurylochus , meanwhile , have step behind a pillar .
In the short moment while the folding door open and close again , he catch a glimpse of a very beautiful woman rise from the loom , and come to meet the poor weather-beaten wanderer , with a hospitable smile , and her hand stretch out in welcome .
There be four other young woman , who join their hand and dance merrily forward , make gesture of obeisance to the stranger .
They be only less beautiful than the lady who seem to be their mistress .
Yet Eurylochus fancy that one of them have sea-green hair , and that the close-fitting bodice of a second look like the bark of a tree , and that both the others have something odd in their aspect , although he could not quite determine what it be , in the little while that he have to examine them .
The folding door swing quickly back , and leave him stand behind the pillar , in the solitude of the outer hall .
There Eurylochus wait until he be quite weary , and listen eagerly to every sound , but without hear anything that could help him to guess what have become of his friend .
Footsteps , it be true , seem to be pass and repassing , in other part of the palace .
Then there be a clatter of silver dish , or golden one , which make him imagine a rich feast in a splendid banqueting hall .
But by and by he hear a tremendous grunting and squealing , and then a sudden scampering , like that of small , hard hoof over a marble floor , while the voice of the mistress and her four handmaiden be scream all together , in tone of anger and derision .
Eurylochus could not conceive what have happen , unless a drove of swine have break into the palace , attract by the smell of the feast .
Chancing to cast his eye at the fountain , he saw that it do not shift it shape , a formerly , nor look either like a long-robed man , or a lion , a tiger , a wolf , or an as .
It look like nothing but a hog , which lay wallow in the marble basin , and fill it from brim to brim .
But we must leave the prudent Eurylochus waiting in the outer hall , and follow his friend into the inner secrecy of the palace .
As soon a the beautiful woman saw them , she arise from the loom , a I have tell you , and come forward , smile , and stretch out her hand .
She take the hand of the foremost among them , and bid him and the whole party welcome .
`` You have be long expect , my good friend , '' say she .
`` I and my maiden be well acquaint with you , although you do not appear to recognize u .
Look at this piece of tapestry , and judge if your face must not have be familiar to u . ''
So the voyager examine the web of cloth which the beautiful woman have be weave in her loom ; and , to their vast astonishment , they saw their own figure perfectly represent in different colored thread .
It be a life-like picture of their recent adventure , show them in the cave of Polyphemus , and how they have put out his one great moony eye ; while in another part of the tapestry they be untie the leathern bag , puff out with contrary wind ; and far on , they behold themselves scamper away from the gigantic king of the Laestrygons , who have catch one of them by the leg .
Lastly , there they be , sit on the desolate shore of this very island , hungry and downcast , and look ruefully at the bare bone of the stag which they devour yesterday .
This be as far a the work have yet proceed ; but when the beautiful woman should again sit down at her loom , she would probably make a picture of what have since happen to the stranger , and of what be now go to happen .
`` You see , '' she say , `` that I know all about your trouble ; and you can not doubt that I desire to make you happy for as long a time a you may remain with me .
For this purpose , my honored guest , I have order a banquet to be prepare .
Fish , fowl , and flesh , roast , and in luscious stew , and season , I trust , to all your taste , be ready to be serve up .
If your appetite tell you it be dinner time , then come with me to the festal saloon . ''
At this kind invitation , the hungry mariner be quite overjoy ; and one of them , take upon himself to be spokesman , assure their hospitable hostess that any hour of the day be dinner time with them , whenever they could get flesh to put in the pot , and fire to boil it with .
So the beautiful woman lead the way ; and the four maiden -LRB- one of them have sea-green hair , another a bodice of oak bark , a third sprinkle a shower of water drop from her finger ' end , and the fourth have some other oddity , which I have forget -RRB- , all these follow behind , and hurry the guest along , until they enter a magnificent saloon .
It be build in a perfect oval , and light from a crystal dome above .
Around the wall be range two and twenty throne , overhung by canopy of crimson and gold , and provide with the softest of cushion , which be tasselled and fringe with gold cord .
Each of the stranger be invite to sit down ; and there they be , two and twenty storm-beaten mariner , in worn and tattered garb , sit on two and twenty cushion and canopy throne , so rich and gorgeous that the proud monarch have nothing more splendid in his stately hall .
Then you might have see the guest nodding , wink with one eye , and lean from one throne to another , to communicate their satisfaction in hoarse whisper .
`` Our good hostess have make king of u all , '' say one .
`` Ha !
do you smell the feast ?
I 'll engage it will be fit to set before two and twenty king . ''
`` I hope , '' say another , `` it will be , mainly , good substantial joint , sirloin , sparerib , and hinder quarter , without too many kickshaw .
If I think the good lady would not take it amiss , I should call for a fat slice of fried bacon to begin with . ''
Ah , the glutton and gormandizers !
You see how it be with them .
In the lofty seat of dignity , on royal throne , they could think of nothing but their greedy appetite , which be the portion of their nature that they share with wolf and swine ; so that they resemble those vile of animal far more than they do king -- if , indeed , king be what they ought to be .
But the beautiful woman now clap her hand ; and immediately there enter a train of two and twenty serve man , bring dish of the rich food , all hot from the kitchen fire , and send up such a steam that it hang like a cloud below the crystal dome of the saloon .
An equal number of attendant bring great flagon of wine , of various kind , some of which sparkle a it be pour out , and go bubble down the throat ; while , of other sort , the purple liquor be so clear that you could see the wrought figure at the bottom of the goblet .
While the servant supply the two and twenty guest with food and drink , the hostess and her four maiden go from one throne to another , exhort them to eat their fill , and to quaff wine abundantly , and thus to recompense themselves , at this one banquet , for the many day when they have go without a dinner .
But whenever the mariner be not look at them -LRB- which be pretty often , a they look chiefly into the basin and platter -RRB- , the beautiful woman and her damsel turn aside , and laugh .
Even the servant , a they kneel down to present the dish , might be see to grin and sneer , while the guest be help themselves to the offer dainty .
And , once in a while , the stranger seem to taste something that they do not like .
`` Here be an odd kind of spice in this dish , '' say one .
`` I ca n't say it quite suit my palate .
Down it go , however . ''
`` Send a good draught of wine down your throat , '' say his comrade on the next throne .
`` That be the stuff to make this sort of cookery relish well .
Though I must need say , the wine have a queer taste too .
But the more I drink of it , the good I like the flavor . ''
Whatever little fault they might find with the dish , they sit at dinner a prodigiously long while ; and it would really have make you ashamed to see how they swill down the liquor and gobble up the food .
They sit on golden throne , to be sure ; but they behave like pig in a sty ; and , if they have have their wit about them , they might have guess that this be the opinion of their beautiful hostess and her maiden .
It bring a blush into my face to reckon up , in my own mind , what mountains of meat and pudding , and what gallon of wine , these two and twenty guzzler and gormandizers eat and drank .
They forget all about their home , and their wife and child , and all about Ulysses , and everything else , except this banquet , at which they want to keep feasting forever .
But at length they begin to give over , from mere incapacity to hold any more .
`` That last bit of fat be too much for me , '' say one .
`` And I have not room for another morsel , '' say his next neighbor , heave a sigh .
`` What a pity !
My appetite be as sharp a ever . ''
In short , they all leave off eating , and lean back on their throne , with such a stupid and helpless aspect a make them ridiculous to behold .
When their hostess saw this , she laugh aloud ; so do her four damsel ; so do the two and twenty serve men that bore the dish , and their two and twenty fellow that pour out the wine .
And the louder they all laugh , the more stupid and helpless do the two and twenty gormandizers look .
Then the beautiful woman take her stand in the middle of the saloon , and stretch out a slender rod -LRB- it have be all the while in her hand , although they never notice it till this moment -RRB- , she turn it from one guest to another , until each have felt it point at himself .
Beautiful a her face be , and though there be a smile on it , it look just a wicked and mischievous a the ugly serpent that ever be see ; and fat-witted a the voyager have make themselves , they begin to suspect that they have fall into the power of an evil-minded enchantress .
`` Wretches , '' cry she , `` you have abuse a lady 's hospitality ; and in this princely saloon your behavior have be suit to a hog-pen .
You be already swine in everything but the human form , which you disgrace , and which I myself should be ashamed to keep a moment longer , be you to share it with me .
But it will require only the slight exercise of magic to make the exterior conform to the hoggish disposition .
Assume your proper shape , gormandizers , and begone to the sty ! ''
Uttering these last word , she wave her wand ; and stamp her foot imperiously , each of the guest be strike aghast at behold , instead of his comrade in human shape , one and twenty hog sit on the same number of golden throne .
Each man -LRB- a he still suppose himself to be -RRB- essay to give a cry of surprise , but find that he could merely grunt , and that , in a word , he be just such another beast a his companion .
It look so intolerably absurd to see hog on cushioned throne , that they make haste to wallow down upon all four , like other swine .
They try to groan and beg for mercy , but forthwith emit the most awful grunting and squealing that ever come out of swinish throat .
They would have wring their hand in despair , but , attempt to do so , grow all the more desperate for see themselves squat on their ham , and paw the air with their fore trotter .
Dear me !
what pendulous ears they have !
what little red eye , half bury in fat !
and what long snout , instead of Grecian nose !
But brute a they certainly be , they yet have enough of human nature in them to be shock at their own hideousness ; and still intend to groan , they utter a viler grunt and squeal than before .
So harsh and ear-piercing it be , that you would have fancy a butcher be stick his knife into each of their throat , or , at the very least , that somebody be pull every hog by his funny little twist of a tail .
`` Begone to your sty ! ''
cry the enchantress , give them some smart stroke with her wand ; and then she turn to the serve men -- `` Drive out these swine , and throw down some acorn for them to eat . ''
The door of the saloon be flung open , the drove of hog run in all direction save the right one , in accordance with their hoggish perversity , but be finally drive into the back yard of the palace .
It be a sight to bring tear into one 's eye -LRB- and I hope none of you will be cruel enough to laugh at it -RRB- , to see the poor creature go snuff along , pick up here a cabbage leaf and there a turnip top , and root their nose in the earth for whatever they could find .
In their sty , moreover , they behave more piggishly than the pig that have be bear so ; for they bite and snort at one another , put their foot in the trough , and gobble up their victual in a ridiculous hurry ; and , when there be nothing more to be have , they make a great pile of themselves among some unclean straw , and fell fast asleep .
If they have any human reason leave , it be just enough to keep them wonder when they should be slaughter , and what quality of bacon they should make .
Meantime , a I tell you before , Eurylochus have wait , and wait , and wait , in the entrance hall of the palace , without be able to comprehend what have befall his friend .
At last , when the swinish uproar resound through the palace , and when he saw the image of a hog in the marble basin , he think it best to hasten back to the vessel , and inform the wise Ulysses of these marvelous occurrence .
So he run as fast a he could down the step , and never stop to draw breath till he reach the shore .
`` Why do you come alone ? ''
ask King Ulysses , as soon a he saw him .
`` Where be your two and twenty comrade ? ''
At these question , Eurylochus burst into tear .
`` Alas ! ''
he cry , `` I greatly fear that we shall never see one of their face again . ''
Then he tell Ulysses all that have happen , as far a he know it , and add that he suspect the beautiful woman to be a vile enchantress , and the marble palace , magnificent a it look , to be only a dismal cavern in reality .
As for his companion , he could not imagine what have become of them , unless they have be give to the swine to be devour alive .
At this intelligence , all the voyager be greatly affright .
But Ulysses lose no time in gird on his sword , and hang his bow and quiver over his shoulder , and take a spear in his right hand .
When his follower saw their wise leader make these preparation , they inquire whither he be go , and earnestly beseech him not to leave them .
`` You be our king , '' cry they ; `` and what be more , you be the wise man in the whole world , and nothing but your wisdom and courage can get u out of this danger .
If you desert u , and go to the enchanted palace , you will suffer the same fate a our poor companion , and not a soul of u will ever see our dear Ithaca again . ''
`` As I be your king , '' answer Ulysses , `` and wise than any of you , it be therefore the more my duty to see what have befall our comrade , and whether anything can yet be do to rescue them .
Wait for me here until tomorrow .
If I do not then return , you must hoist sail , and endeavor to find your way to our native land .
For my part , I be answerable for the fate of these poor mariner , who have stand by my side in battle , and be so often drench to the skin , along with me , by the same tempestuous surge .
I will either bring them back with me , or perish . ''
Had his follower dare , they would have detain him by force .
But King Ulysses frown sternly on them , and shake his spear , and bid them stop him at their peril .
Seeing him so determine , they let him go , and sit down on the sand , a disconsolate a set of people a could be , wait and pray for his return .
It happen to Ulysses , just a before , that , when he have go a few step from the edge of the cliff , the purple bird come fluttering towards him , cry , `` Peep , peep , pe -- weep ! ''
and use all the art it could to persuade him to go no farther .
`` What mean you , little bird ? ''
cried Ulysses .
`` You be array like a king in purple and gold , and wear a golden crown upon your head .
Is it because I too be a king , that you desire so earnestly to speak with me ?
If you can talk in human language , say what you would have me do . ''
`` Peep ! ''
answer the purple bird , very dolorously .
`` Peep , peep , pe -- we -- e ! '' Certainly there lay some heavy anguish at the little bird 's heart ; and it be a sorrowful predicament that he could not , at least , have the consolation of tell what it be .
But Ulysses have no time to waste in try to get at the mystery .
He therefore quicken his pace , and have go a good way along the pleasant wood path , when there meet him a young man of very brisk and intelligent aspect , and clad in a rather singular garb .
He wear a short cloak and a sort of cap that seem to be furnish with a pair of wing ; and from the lightness of his step , you would have suppose that there might likewise be wing on his foot .
To enable him to walk still well -LRB- for he be always on one journey or another -RRB- he carry a winged staff , around which two serpent be wriggle and twist .
In short , I have say enough to make you guess that it be Quicksilver ; and Ulysses -LRB- who know him of old , and have learn a great deal of his wisdom from him -RRB- recognize him in a moment .
`` Whither be you go in such a hurry , wise Ulysses ? ''
ask Quicksilver .
`` Do you not know that this island be enchant ?
The wicked enchantress -LRB- whose name be Circe , the sister of King Aetes -RRB- dwell in the marble palace which you see yonder among the tree .
By her magic arts she change every human be into the brute , beast , or fowl whom he happen most to resemble . ''
`` That little bird , which meet me at the edge of the cliff , '' exclaim Ulysses ; `` be he a human be once ? ''
`` Yes , '' answer Quicksilver .
`` He be once a king , name Picus , and a pretty good sort of a king , too , only rather too proud of his purple robe , and his crown , and the golden chain about his neck ; so he be force to take the shape of a gaudy-feathered bird .
The lion , and wolf , and tiger , who will come run to meet you , in front of the palace , be formerly fierce and cruel men , resemble in their disposition the wild beast whose form they now rightfully wear . ''
`` And my poor companion , '' say Ulysses .
`` Have they undergo a similar change , through the art of this wicked Circe ? ''
`` You well know what gormandizers they be , '' reply Quicksilver ; and rogue that he be , he could not help laugh at the joke .
`` So you will not be surprise to hear that they have all take the shape of swine !
If Circe have never do anything bad , I really should not think her so very much to blame . ''
`` But can I do nothing to help them ? ''
inquired Ulysses .
`` It will require all your wisdom , '' say Quicksilver , `` and a little of my own into the bargain , to keep your royal and sagacious self from be transform into a fox .
But do a I bid you ; and the matter may end good than it have begin . ''
While he be speak , Quicksilver seem to be in search of something ; he go stoop along the ground , and soon lay his hand on a little plant with a snow-white flower , which he pluck and smelt of .
Ulysses have be look at that very spot only just before ; and it appear to him that the plant have burst into full flower the instant when Quicksilver touch it with his finger .
`` Take this flower , King Ulysses , '' say he .
`` Guard it a you do your eyesight ; for I can assure you it be exceedingly rare and precious , and you might seek the whole earth over without ever find another like it .
Keep it in your hand , and smell of it frequently after you enter the palace , and while you be talk with the enchantress .
Especially when she offer you food , or a draught of wine out of her goblet , be careful to fill your nostril with the flower 's fragrance .
Follow these direction , and you may defy her magic art to change you into a fox . ''
Quicksilver then give him some further advice how to behave , and bid him be bold and prudent , again assure him that , powerful a Circe be , he would have a fair prospect of come safely out of her enchanted palace .
After listen attentively , Ulysses thank his good friend , and resume his way .
But he have take only a few step , when , recollect some other question which he wish to ask , he turn round again , and behold nobody on the spot where Quicksilver have stand ; for that wing cap of his , and those wing shoe , with the help of the winged staff , have carry him quickly out of sight .
When Ulysses reach the lawn , in front of the palace , the lion and other savage animal come bound to meet him , and would have fawn upon him and lick his foot .
But the wise king strike at them with his long spear , and sternly bid them begone out of his path ; for he know that they have once be bloodthirsty men , and would now tear him limb from limb , instead of fawn upon him , could they do the mischief that be in their heart .
The wild beast yelp and glare at him , and stand at a distance , while he ascend the palace step .
On enter the hall , Ulysses saw the magic fountain in the center of it .
The up-gushing water have now again take the shape of a man in a long , white , fleecy robe , who appear to be make gesture of welcome .
The king likewise hear the noise of the shuttle in the loom and the sweet melody of the beautiful woman 's song , and then the pleasant voice of herself and the four maiden talk together , with peal of merry laughter intermixed .
But Ulysses do not waste much time in listen to the laughter or the song .
He lean his spear against one of the pillar of the hall , and then , after loosen his sword in the scabbard , step boldly forward , and throw the folding door wide open .
The moment she behold his stately figure stand in the doorway , the beautiful woman rise from the loom , and run to meet him with a glad smile throw it sunshine over her face , and both her hand extend .
`` Welcome , brave stranger ! ''
cry she .
`` We be expect you . ''
And the nymph with the sea-green hair make a courtesy down to the ground , and likewise bid him welcome ; so do her sister with the bodice of oaken bark , and she that sprinkle dew-drops from her finger ' end , and the fourth one with some oddity which I can not remember .
And Circe , a the beautiful enchantress be call -LRB- who have delude so many person that she do not doubt of be able to delude Ulysses , not imagine how wise he be -RRB- , again address him : `` Your companion , '' say she , `` have already be receive into my palace , and have enjoy the hospitable treatment to which the propriety of their behavior so well entitle them .
If such be your pleasure , you shall first take some refreshment , and then join them in the elegant apartment which they now occupy .
See , I and my maiden have be weave their figure into this piece of tapestry . ''
She point to the web of beautifully-woven cloth in the loom .
Circe and the four nymph must have be very diligently at work since the arrival of the mariner ; for a great many yard of tapestry have now be work , in addition to what I before described .
In this new part , Ulysses saw his two and twenty friend represent a sit on cushion and canopied throne , greedily devour dainty , and quaff deep draught of wine .
The work have not yet go any far .
O , no , indeed .
The enchantress be far too cunning to let Ulysses see the mischief which her magic art have since bring upon the gormandizers .
`` As for yourself , valiant sir , '' say Circe , `` judging by the dignity of your aspect , I take you to be nothing less than a king .
Deign to follow me , and you shall be treat a befits your rank . ''
So Ulysses follow her into the oval saloon , where his two and twenty comrade have devour the banquet , which end so disastrously for themselves .
But , all this while , he have hold the snow-white flower in his hand , and have constantly smelt of it while Circe be speak ; and a he cross the threshold of the saloon , he take good care to inhale several long and deep snuff of it fragrance .
Instead of two and twenty throne , which have before be range around the wall , there be now only a single throne , in the center of the apartment .
But this be surely the most magnificent seat that ever a king or an emperor repose himself upon , all make of chased gold , stud with precious stone , with a cushion that look like a soft heap of living rose , and overhung by a canopy of sunlight which Circe know how to weave into drapery .
The enchantress take Ulysses by the hand , and make him sit down upon this dazzle throne .
Then , clap her hand , she summon the chief butler .
`` Bring hither , '' say she , `` the goblet that be set apart for king to drink out of .
And fill it with the same delicious wine which my royal brother , King Aetes , praise so highly , when he last visit me with my fair daughter Medea .
That good and amiable child !
Were she now here , it would delight her to see me offer this wine to my honored guest . ''
But Ulysses , while the butler be go for the wine , hold the snow-white flower to his nose .
`` Is it a wholesome wine ? ''
he ask .
At this the four maiden titter ; whereupon the enchantress look round at them , with an aspect of severity .
`` It be the wholesome juice that ever be squeeze out of the grape , '' say she ; `` for , instead of disguise a man , a other liquor be apt to do , it bring him to his true self , and show him a he ought to be . ''
The chief butler like nothing well than to see people turn into swine , or make any kind of a beast of themselves ; so he make haste to bring the royal goblet , fill with a liquid as bright a gold , and which keep sparkle upward , and throw a sunny spray over the brim .
But , delightfully a the wine look , it be mingle with the most potent enchantment that Circe know how to concoct .
For every drop of the pure grape juice there be two drop of the pure mischief ; and the danger of the thing be , that the mischief make it taste all the good .
The mere smell of the bubble , which effervesce at the brim , be enough to turn a man 's beard into pig 's bristle , or make a lion 's claw grow out of his finger , or a fox 's brush behind him .
`` Drink , my noble guest , '' say Circe , smile , a she present him with the goblet .
`` You will find in this draught a solace for all your trouble . ''
King Ulysses take the goblet with his right hand , while with his left he hold the snow-white flower to his nostril , and draw in so long a breath that his lung be quite fill with it pure and simple fragrance .
Then , drink off all the wine , he look the enchantress calmly in the face .
`` Wretch , '' cry Circe , give him a smart stroke with her wand , `` how dare you keep your human shape a moment longer !
Take the form of the brute whom you most resemble .
If a hog , go join your fellow-swine in the sty ; if a lion , a wolf , a tiger , go howl with the wild beast on the lawn ; if a fox , go exercise your craft in steal poultry .
Thou hast quaff off my wine , and canst be man no long . ''
But , such be the virtue of the snow-white flower , instead of wallow down from his throne in swinish shape , or take any other brutal form , Ulysses look even more manly and king-like than before .
He give the magic goblet a toss , and send it clash over the marble floor to the farthest end of the saloon .
Then , draw his sword , he seize the enchantress by her beautiful ringlet , and make a gesture a if he mean to strike off her head at one blow .
`` Wicked Circe , '' cry he , in a terrible voice , `` this sword shall put an end to thy enchant meet .
Thou shalt die , vile wretch , and do no more mischief in the world , by tempt human being into the vice which make beast of them . ''
The tone and countenance of Ulysses be so awful , and his sword gleam so brightly , and seem to have so intolerably keen an edge , that Circe be almost kill by the mere fright , without wait for a blow .
The chief butler scramble out of the saloon , pick up the golden goblet a he go ; and the enchantress and the four maiden fell on their knee , wring their hand , and scream for mercy .
`` Spare me ! ''
cry Circe .
`` Spare me , royal and wise Ulysses .
For now I know that thou art he of whom Quicksilver forewarn me , the most prudent of mortal , against whom no enchantment can prevail .
Thou only couldst have conquer Circe .
Spare me , wise of men .
I will show thee true hospitality , and even give myself to be thy slave , and this magnificent palace to be henceforth thy home . ''
The four nymph , meanwhile , be make a most piteous ado ; and especially the ocean nymph , with the sea-green hair , wept a great deal of salt water , and the fountain nymph , besides scatter dewdrop from her finger ' end , nearly melt away into tear .
But Ulysses would not be pacify until Circe have take a solemn oath to change back his companion , and a many others a he should direct , from their present form of beast or bird into their former shape of men .
`` On these condition , '' say he , `` I consent to spare your life .
Otherwise you must die upon the spot . ''
With a drawn sword hanging over her , the enchantress would readily have consent to do as much good a she have hitherto do mischief , however little she might like such employment .
She therefore lead Ulysses out of the back entrance of the palace , and show him the swine in their sty .
There be about fifty of these unclean beast in the whole herd ; and though the great part be hog by birth and education , there be wonderfully little difference to be see betwixt them and their new brother , who have so recently worn the human shape .
To speak critically , indeed , the latter rather carry the thing to excess , and seem to make it a point to wallow in the miriest part of the sty , and otherwise to outdo the original swine in their own natural vocation .
When men once turn to brute , the trifle of man 's wit that remain in them add tenfold to their brutality .
The comrade of Ulysses , however , have not quite lose the remembrance of have formerly stood erect .
When he approach the sty , two and twenty enormous swine separate themselves from the herd , and scamper towards him , with such a chorus of horrible squealing a make him clap both hand to his ear .
And yet they do not seem to know what they want , nor whether they be merely hungry , or miserable from some other cause .
It be curious , in the midst of their distress , to observe them thrust their nose into the mire , in quest of something to eat .
The nymph with the bodice of oaken bark -LRB- she be the hamadryad of an oak -RRB- throw a handful of acorn among them ; and the two and twenty hog scramble and fight for the prize , a if they have taste not so much a a noggin of sour milk for a twelvemonth .
`` These must certainly be my comrade , '' say Ulysses .
`` I recognize their disposition .
They be hardly worth the trouble of change them into the human form again .
Nevertheless , we will have it do , l their bad example should corrupt the other hog .
Let them take their original shape , therefore , Dame Circe , if your skill be equal to the task .
It will require great magic , I trow , than it do to make swine of them . ''
So Circe wave her wand again , and repeat a few magic word , at the sound of which the two and twenty hog prick up their pendulous ear .
It be a wonder to behold how their snout grow short and short , and their mouth -LRB- which they seem to be sorry for , because they could not gobble so expeditiously -RRB- small and small , and how one and another begin to stand upon his hind leg , and scratch his nose with his fore trotter .
At first the spectator hardly know whether to call them hog or men , but by and by come to the conclusion that they rather resemble the latter .
Finally , there stand the twenty-two comrade of Ulysses , look pretty much the same a when they leave the vessel .
You must not imagine , however , that the swinish quality have entirely go out of them .
When once it fasten itself into a person 's character , it be very difficult get rid of it .
This be prove by the hamadryad , who , be exceedingly fond of mischief , throw another handful of acorn before the twenty-two newly-restored people ; whereupon down they wallow in a moment , and gobble them up in a very shameful way .
Then , recollect themselves , they scramble to their foot , and look more than commonly foolish .
`` Thanks , noble Ulysses ! ''
they cry .
`` From brute beast you have restore u to the condition of men again . ''
`` Do not put yourselves to the trouble of thank me , '' say the wise king .
`` I fear I have do but little for you . ''
To say the truth , there be a suspicious kind of a grunt in their voice , and , for a long time afterwards , they speak gruffly , and be apt to set up a squeal .
`` It must depend on your own future behavior , '' add Ulysses , `` whether you do not find your way back to the sty . ''
At this moment , the note of a bird sound from the branch of a neighboring tree .
`` Peep , peep , pe -- wee -- e ! '' It be the purple bird , who , all this while , have be sit over their head , watch what be go forward , and hop that Ulysses would remember how he have do his utmost to keep him and his follower out of harm 's way .
Ulysses order Circe instantly to make a king of this good little fowl , and leave him exactly a she find him .
Hardly be the word speak , and before the bird have time to utter another `` pe -- weep , '' King Picus leap down from the bough of a tree , a majestic a sovereign a any in the world , dress in a long purple robe and gorgeous yellow stocking , with a splendidly wrought collar about his neck , and a golden crown upon his head .
He and King Ulysses exchange with one another the courtesy which belong to their elevated rank .
But from that time forth , King Picus be no long proud of his crown and his trapping of royalty , nor of the fact of his be a king ; he felt himself merely the upper servant of his people , and that it must be his life-long labor to make them good and happy .
As for the lion , tiger , and wolves -LRB- though Circe would have restore them to their former shape at his slight word -RRB- , Ulysses think it advisable that they should remain a they now be , and thus give warning of their cruel disposition , instead of go about under the guise of men , and pretend to human sympathy , while their heart have the blood-thirstiness of wild beast .
So he let them howl as much a they like , but never trouble his head about them .
And , when everything be settle accord to his pleasure , he send to summon the remainder of his comrade , whom he have leave at the sea-shore .
These be arrive , with the prudent Eurylochus at their head , they all make themselves comfortable in Circe 's enchanted palace , until quite rest and refresh from the toil and hardship of their voyage .
THE POMEGRANATE SEEDS .
Mother Ceres be exceedingly fond of her daughter Proserpina , and seldom let her go alone into the field .
But , just at the time when my story begin , the good lady be very busy , because she have the care of the wheat , and the Indian corn , and the rye and barley and , in short , of the crop of every kind , all over the earth ; and a the season have thus far be uncommonly backward , it be necessary to make the harvest ripen more speedily than usual .
So she put on her turban , make of poppy -LRB- a kind of flower which she be always note for wear -RRB- , and get into her car drawn by a pair of winged dragon , and be just ready to set off .
`` Dear mother , '' say Proserpina , `` I shall be very lonely while you be away .
May I not run down to the shore , and ask some of the sea nymph to come up out of the wave and play with me ? ''
`` Yes , child , '' answer Mother Ceres .
`` The sea nymph be good creature , and will never lead you into any harm .
But you must take care not to stray away from them , nor go wander about the field by yourself .
Young girl , without their mother to take care of them , be very apt to get into mischief . ''
The child promise to be as prudent a if she be a grown-up woman ; and , by the time the winged dragon have whirl the car out of sight , she be already on the shore , call to the sea nymph to come and play with her .
They know Proserpina 's voice , and be not long in show their glistening face and sea-green hair above the water , at the bottom of which be their home .
They bring along with them a great many beautiful shell ; and sit down on the moist sand , where the surf wave break over them , they busy themselves in make a necklace , which they hang round Proserpina 's neck .
By way of show her gratitude , the child beseech them to go with her a little way into the field , so that they might gather abundance of flower , with which she would make each of her kind playmates a wreath .
`` O no , dear Proserpina , '' cry the sea nymph ; `` we dare not go with you upon the dry land .
We be apt to grow faint , unless at every breath we can snuff up the salt breeze of the ocean .
And do n't you see how careful we be to let the surf wave break over u every moment or two , so a to keep ourselves comfortably moist ?
If it be not for that , we should look like bunch of uprooted seaweed dry in the sun .
`` It be a great pity , '' say Proserpina .
`` But do you wait for me here , and I will run and gather my apron full of flower , and be back again before the surf wave have break ten time over you .
I long to make you some wreath that shall be as lovely a this necklace of many colored shell . ''
`` We will wait , then , '' answer the sea nymph .
`` But while you be go , we may as well lie down on a bank of soft sponge under the water .
The air to-day be a little too dry for our comfort .
But we will pop up our head every few minute to see if you be come . ''
The young Proserpina run quickly to a spot where , only the day before , she have see a great many flower .
These , however , be now a little past their bloom ; and wish to give her friends the freshest and lovely blossom , she stray far into the field , and find some that make her scream with delight .
Never have she meet with such exquisite flower before -- violet so large and fragrant -- rose with so rich and delicate a blush -- such superb hyacinth and such aromatic pink -- and many others , some of which seem to be of new shape and color .
Two or three time , moreover , she could not help think that a tuft of most splendid flower have suddenly sprout out of the earth before her very eyes , a if on purpose to tempt her a few step far .
Proserpina 's apron be soon fill , and brim over with delightful blossom .
She be on the point of turn back in order to rejoin the sea nymph , and sit with them on the moist sand , all twin wreath together .
But , a little farther on , what should she behold ?
It be a large shrub , completely cover with the most magnificent flower in the world .
`` The darling ! ''
cried Proserpina ; and then she think to herself , `` I be look at that spot only a moment ago .
How strange it be that I do not see the flower ! ''
The nearer she approach the shrub , the more attractive it look , until she come quite close to it ; and then , although it beauty be rich than word can tell , she hardly know whether to like it or not .
It bore above a hundred flower of the most brilliant hue , and each different from the others , but all have a kind of resemblance among themselves , which show them to be sister blossom .
But there be a deep , glossy luster on the leaf of the shrub , and on the petal of the flower , that make Proserpina doubt whether they might not be poisonous .
To tell you the truth , foolish a it may seem , she be half inclined to turn round and run away .
`` What a silly child I be ! ''
thought she , take courage .
`` It be really the most beautiful shrub that ever spring out of the earth .
I will pull it up by the root , and carry it home , and plant it in my mother 's garden . ''
Holding up her apron full of flower with her left hand , Proserpina seize the large shrub with the other , and pull , and pull , but be hardly able to loosen the soil about it root .
What a deep-rooted plant it be !
Again the girl pull with all her might , and observe that the earth begin to stir and crack to some distance around the stem .
She give another pull , but relax her hold , fancy that there be a rumble sound right beneath her foot .
Did the root extend down into some enchanted cavern ?
Then laugh at herself for so childish a notion , she make another effort : up come the shrub , and Proserpina stagger back , hold the stem triumphantly in her hand , and gaze at the deep hole which it root have leave in the soil .
Much to her astonishment , this hole keep spread wider and wider , and grow deep and deep , until it really seem to have no bottom ; and all the while , there come a rumbling noise out of it depth , louder and louder , and nearer and nearer , and sound like the tramp of horse ' hoof and the rattling of wheel .
Too much frighten to run away , she stand strain her eye into this wonderful cavity , and soon saw a team of four sable horse , snort smoke out of their nostril , and tear their way out of the earth with a splendid golden chariot whirl at their heel .
They leap out of the bottomless hole , chariot and all ; and there they be , toss their black mane , flourish their black tail , and curvet with every one of their hoof off the ground at once , close by the spot where Proserpina stand .
In the chariot sit the figure of a man , richly dress , with a crown on his head , all flame with diamond .
He be of a noble aspect , and rather handsome , but look sullen and discontent ; and he keep rub his eye and shade them with his hand , a if he do not live enough in the sunshine to be very fond of it light .
As soon a this personage saw the affrighted Proserpina , he beckon her to come a little nearer .
`` Do not be afraid , '' say he , with as cheerful a smile a he know how to put on .
`` Come !
Will you not like to ride a little way with me , in my beautiful chariot ? ''
But Proserpina be so alarmed , that she wish for nothing but to get out of his reach .
And no wonder .
The stranger do not look remarkably good-natured , in spite of his smile ; and a for his voice , it tone be deep and stern , and sound as much like the rumbling of an earthquake underground than anything else .
As be always the case with child in trouble , Proserpina 's first thought be to call for her mother .
`` Mother , Mother Ceres ! ''
cry she , all in a tremble .
`` Come quickly and save me . ''
But her voice be too faint for her mother to hear .
Indeed , it be most probable that Ceres be then a thousand mile off , make the corn grow in some far distant country .
Nor could it have avail her poor daughter , even have she be within hearing ; for no sooner do Proserpina begin to cry out , than the stranger leap to the ground , catch the child in his arm , and again mount the chariot , shake the rein , and shout to the four black horse to set off .
They immediately break into so swift a gallop , that it seem rather like fly through the air than run along the earth .
In a moment , Proserpina lose sight of the pleasant vale of Enna , in which she have always dwell .
Another instant , and even the summit of Mount Aetna have become so blue in the distance , that she could scarcely distinguish it from the smoke that gush out of it crater .
But still the poor child scream , and scatter her apron full of flower along the way , and leave a long cry trail behind the chariot ; and many mother , to whose ear it come , run quickly to see if any mischief have befall their child .
But Mother Ceres be a great way off , and could not hear the cry .
As they ride on , the stranger do his best to soothe her .
`` Why should you be so frightened , my pretty child ? ''
say he , try to soften his rough voice .
`` I promise not to do you any harm .
What !
you have be gather flower ?
Wait till we come to my palace , and I will give you a garden full of pretty flower than those , all make of pearl , and diamond , and ruby .
Can you guess who I be ?
They call my name Pluto ; and I be the king of diamond and all other precious stone .
Every atom of the gold and silver that lie under the earth belong to me , to say nothing of the copper and iron , and of the coal mine , which supply me with abundance of fuel .
Do you see this splendid crown upon my head ?
You may have it for a plaything .
O , we shall be very good friend , and you will find me more agreeable than you expect , when once we get out of this troublesome sunshine . ''
`` Let me go home ! ''
cry Proserpina .
`` Let me go home ! ''
`` My home be good than your mother 's , '' answer King Pluto .
`` It be a palace , all make of gold , with crystal window ; and because there be little or no sunshine thereabouts , the apartment be illuminate with diamond lamp .
You never saw anything half so magnificent a my throne .
If you like , you may sit down on it , and be my little queen , and I will sit on the footstool . ''
`` I do n't care for golden palace and throne , '' sob Proserpina .
`` Oh , my mother , my mother !
Carry me back to my mother ! ''
But King Pluto , a he call himself , only shout to his steed to go faster .
`` Pray do not be foolish , Proserpina , '' say he , in rather a sullen tone .
`` I offer you my palace and my crown , and all the rich that be under the earth ; and you treat me a if I be do you an injury .
The one thing which my palace need be a merry little maid , to run upstairs and down , and cheer up the room with her smile .
And this be what you must do for King Pluto . ''
`` Never ! ''
answered Proserpina , look as miserable a she could .
`` I shall never smile again till you set me down at my mother 's door . ''
But she might just as well have talk to the wind that whistle past them , for Pluto urge on his horse , and go fast than ever .
Proserpina continue to cry out , and scream so long and so loudly that her poor little voice be almost scream away ; and when it be nothing but a whisper , she happen to cast her eye over a great broad field of wave grain -- and whom do you think she saw ?
Who , but Mother Ceres , make the corn grow , and too busy to notice the golden chariot a it go rattle along .
The child muster all her strength , and give one more scream , but be out of sight before Ceres have time to turn her head .
King Pluto have take a road which now begin to grow excessively gloomy .
It be border on each side with rock and precipice , between which the rumbling of the chariot wheel be reverberate with a noise like roll thunder .
The tree and bush that grow in the crevice of the rock have very dismal foliage ; and by and by , although it be hardly noon , the air become obscure with a gray twilight .
The black horse have rush along so swiftly , that they be already beyond the limit of the sunshine .
But the duskier it grow , the more do Pluto 's visage assume an air of satisfaction .
After all , he be not an ill-looking person , especially when he leave off twist his feature into a smile that do not belong to them .
Proserpina peep at his face through the gathering dusk , and hop that he might not be so very wicked a she at first think him .
`` Ah , this twilight be truly refreshing , '' say King Pluto , `` after be so torment with that ugly and impertinent glare of the sun .
How much more agreeable be lamplight or torchlight , more particularly when reflect from diamond !
It will be a magnificent sight , when we get to my palace . ''
`` Is it much far ? ''
ask Proserpina .
`` And will you carry me back when I have see it ? ''
`` We will talk of that by and by , '' answer Pluto .
`` We be just enter my dominion .
Do you see that tall gateway before u ?
When we pass those gate , we be at home .
And there lie my faithful mastiff at the threshold .
Cerberus !
Cerberus !
Come hither , my good dog ! ''
So say , Pluto pull at the rein , and stop the chariot right between the tall , massive pillar of the gateway .
The mastiff of which he have speak get up from the threshold , and stand on his hinder leg , so a to put his fore paw on the chariot wheel .
But , my star , what a strange dog it be !
Why , he be a big , rough , ugly-looking monster , with three separate head , and each of them fierce than the two others ; but fierce a they be , King Pluto pat them all .
He seem a fond of his three-headed dog a if it have be a sweet little spaniel , with silken ear and curly hair .
Cerberus , on the other hand , be evidently rejoice to see his master , and express his attachment , a other dog do , by wag his tail at a great rate .
Proserpina 's eye be draw to it by it brisk motion , she saw that this tail be neither more nor less than a live dragon , with fiery eye , and fang that have a very poisonous aspect .
And while the three-headed Cerberus be fawn so lovingly on King Pluto , there be the dragon tail wag against it will , and look a cross and ill-natured a you can imagine , on it own separate account .
`` Will the dog bite me ? ''
ask Proserpina , shrink close to Pluto .
`` What an ugly creature he be ! ''
`` O , never fear , '' answer her companion .
`` He never harm people , unless they try to enter my dominion without be send for , or to get away when I wish to keep them here .
Down , Cerberus !
Now , my pretty Proserpina , we will drive on . ''
On go the chariot , and King Pluto seem greatly pleased to find himself once more in his own kingdom .
He draw Proserpina 's attention to the rich vein of gold that be to be see among the rock , and point to several place where one stroke of a pickaxe would loosen a bushel of diamond .
All along the road , indeed , there be sparkle gem , which would have be of inestimable value above ground , but which here be reckon of the meaner sort and hardly worth a beggar 's stooping for .
Not far from the gateway , they come to a bridge , which seem to be build of iron .
Pluto stop the chariot , and bid Proserpina look at the stream which be glide so lazily beneath it .
Never in her life have she behold so torpid , so black , so muddy-looking a stream ; it water reflect no image of anything that be on the bank , and it move as sluggishly a if it have quite forget which way it ought to flow , and have rather stagnate than flow either one way or the other .
`` This be the River Lethe , '' observe King Pluto .
`` Is it not a very pleasant stream ? ''
`` I think it a very dismal one , '' answer Proserpina .
`` It suit my taste , however , '' answer Pluto , who be apt to be sullen when anybody disagree with him .
`` At all event , it water have one excellent quality ; for a single draught of it make people forget every care and sorrow that have hitherto torment them .
Only sip a little of it , my dear Proserpina , and you will instantly cease to grieve for your mother , and will have nothing in your memory that can prevent your be perfectly happy in my palace .
I will send for some , in a golden goblet , the moment we arrive . ''
`` O , no , no , no ! ''
cry Proserpina , weep afresh .
`` I have a thousand time rather be miserable with remember my mother , than be happy in forget her .
That dear , dear mother !
I never , never will forget her . ''
`` We shall see , '' say King Pluto .
`` You do not know what fine time we will have in my palace .
Here we be just at the portal .
These pillar be solid gold , I assure you . ''
He alight from the chariot , and take Proserpina in his arm , carry her up a lofty flight of step into the great hall of the palace .
It be splendidly illuminate by mean of large precious stone , of various hue , which seem to burn like so many lamp , and glow with a hundred-fold radiance all through the vast apartment .
And yet there be a kind of gloom in the midst of this enchanted light ; nor be there a single object in the hall that be really agreeable to behold , except the little Proserpina herself , a lovely child , with one earthly flower which she have not let fall from her hand .
It be my opinion that even King Pluto have never be happy in his palace , and that this be the true reason why he have steal away Proserpina , in order that he might have something to love , instead of cheat his heart any longer with this tiresome magnificence .
And , though he pretend to dislike the sunshine of the upper world , yet the effect of the child 's presence , bedim a she be by her tear , be a if a faint and watery sunbeam have somehow or other find it way into the enchanted hall .
Pluto now summon his domestic , and bid them lose no time in prepare a most sumptuous banquet , and above all thing , not to fail of set a golden beaker of the water of Lethe by Proserpina 's plate .
`` I will neither drink that nor anything else , '' say Proserpina .
`` Nor will I taste a morsel of food , even if you keep me forever in your palace . ''
`` I should be sorry for that , '' reply King Pluto , pat her cheek ; for he really wish to be kind , if he have only know how .
`` You be a spoiled child , I perceive , my little Proserpina ; but when you see the nice thing which my cook will make for you , your appetite will quickly come again . ''
Then , send for the head cook , he give strict order that all sort of delicacy , such a young people be usually fond of , should be set before Proserpina .
He have a secret motive in this ; for , you be to understand , it be a fixed law , that when person be carry off to the land of magic , if they once taste any food there , they can never get back to their friend .
Now , if King Pluto have be cunning enough to offer Proserpina some fruit , or bread and milk -LRB- which be the simple fare to which the child have always be accustom -RRB- , it be very probable that she would soon have be tempt to eat it .
But he leave the matter entirely to his cook , who , like all other cook , consider nothing fit to eat unless it be rich pastry , or highly-seasoned meat , or spice sweet cake -- thing which Proserpina 's mother have never give her , and the smell of which quite take away her appetite , instead of sharpen it .
But my story must now clamber out of King Pluto 's dominion , and see what Mother Ceres have be about , since she be bereft of her daughter .
We have a glimpse of her , a you remember , half hidden among the waving grain , while the four black steed be swiftly whirl along the chariot , in which her beloved Proserpina be so unwillingly borne away .
You recollect , too , the loud scream which Proserpina give , just when the chariot be out of sight .
Of all the child 's outcry , this last shriek be the only one that reach the ear of Mother Ceres .
She have mistake the rumbling of the chariot wheel for a peal of thunder , and imagine that a shower be come up , and that it would assist her in make the corn grow .
But , at the sound of Proserpina 's shriek , she start , and look about in every direction , not know whence it come , but feel almost certain that it be her daughter 's voice .
It seem so unaccountable , however , that the girl should have stray over so many land and sea -LRB- which she herself could not have traverse without the aid of her winged dragon -RRB- , that the good Ceres try to believe that it must be the child of some other parent , and not her own darling Proserpina , who have utter this lamentable cry .
Nevertheless , it trouble her with a vast many tender fear , such a be ready to bestir themselves in every mother 's heart , when she find it necessary to go away from her dear child without leave them under the care of some maiden aunt , or other such faithful guardian .
So she quickly leave the field in which she have be so busy ; and , a her work be not half do , the grain look , next day , a if it need both sun and rain , and a if it be blight in the ear , and have something the matter with it root .
The pair of dragon must have have very nimble wing ; for , in less than an hour , Mother Ceres have alight at the door of her home , and find it empty .
Knowing , however , that the child be fond of sport on the sea-shore , she hasten thither as fast a she could , and there behold the wet face of the poor sea nymph peeping over a wave .
All this while , the good creature have be wait on the bank of sponge , and once , every half minute or so , have pop up their four head above water , to see if their playmate be yet come back .
When they saw Mother Ceres , they sit down on the crest of the surf wave , and let it toss them ashore at her foot .
`` Where be Proserpina ? ''
cried Ceres .
`` Where be my child ?
Tell me , you naughty sea nymph , have you entice her under the sea ? ''
`` O , no , good Mother Ceres , '' say the innocent sea nymph , toss back their green ringlet , and look her in the face .
`` We never should dream of such a thing .
Proserpina have be at play with u , it be true ; but she leave u a long while ago , mean only to run a little way upon the dry land , and gather some flower for a wreath .
This be early in the day , and we have see nothing of her since . ''
Ceres scarcely wait to hear what the nymph have to say , before she hurry off to make inquiry all through the neighborhood .
But nobody tell her anything that would enable the poor mother to guess what have become of Proserpina .
A fisherman , it be true , have notice her little footprint in the sand , a he go homeward along the beach with a basket of fish ; a rustic have see the child stoop to gather flower ; several person have hear either the rattling of chariot wheel , or the rumbling of distant thunder ; and one old woman , while pluck vervain and catnip , have hear a scream , but suppose it to be some childish nonsense , and therefore do not take the trouble to look up .
The stupid people !
It take them such a tedious while to tell the nothing that they know , that it be dark night before Mother Ceres find out that she must seek her daughter elsewhere .
So she light a torch , and set forth , resolve never to come back until Proserpina be discover .
In her haste and trouble of mind , she quite forget her car and the winged dragon ; or , it may be , she think that she could follow up the search more thoroughly on foot .
At all event , this be the way in which she begin her sorrowful journey , hold her torch before her , and look carefully at every object along the path .
And a it happen , she have not go far before she find one of the magnificent flower which grow on the shrub that Proserpina have pull up .
`` Ha ! ''
think Mother Ceres , examine it by torchlight .
`` Here be mischief in this flower !
The earth do not produce it by any help of mine , nor of it own accord .
It be the work of enchantment , and be therefore poisonous ; and perhaps it have poison my poor child . ''
But she put the poisonous flower in her bosom , not know whether she might ever find any other memorial of Proserpina .
All night long , at the door of every cottage and farm-house , Ceres knock , and call up the weary laborer to inquire if they have see her child ; and they stand , gap and half-asleep , at the threshold , and answer her pityingly , and beseech her to come in and rest .
At the portal of every palace , too , she make so loud a summons that the menial hurry to throw open the gate , think that it must be some great king or queen , who would demand a banquet for supper and a stately chamber to repose in .
And when they saw only a sad and anxious woman , with a torch in her hand and a wreath of withered poppy on her head , they speak rudely , and sometimes threaten to set the dog upon her .
But nobody have see Proserpina , nor could give Mother Ceres the least hint which way to seek her .
Thus pass the night ; and still she continue her search without sit down to rest , or stop to take food , or even remember to put out the torch although first the rosy dawn , and then the glad light of the morning sun , make it red flame look thin and pale .
But I wonder what sort of stuff this torch be make of ; for it burn dimly through the day , and , at night , be as bright a ever , and never be extinguish by the rain or wind , in all the weary day and night while Ceres be seek for Proserpina .
It be not merely of human being that she ask tidings of her daughter .
In the wood and by the stream , she meet creature of another nature , who use , in those old time , to haunt the pleasant and solitary place , and be very sociable with person who understand their language and custom , a Mother Ceres do .
Sometimes , for instance , she tap with her finger against the knotted trunk of a majestic oak ; and immediately it rude bark would cleave asunder , and forth would step a beautiful maiden , who be the hamadryad of the oak , dwell inside of it , and share it long life , and rejoice when it green leaf sport with the breeze .
But not one of these leafy damsel have see Proserpina .
Then , go a little farther , Ceres would , perhaps , come to a fountain , gush out of a pebbly hollow in the earth , and would dabble with her hand in the water .
Behold , up through it sandy and pebbly bed , along with the fountain 's gush , a young woman with drip hair would arise , and stand gaze at Mother Ceres , half out of the water , and undulate up and down with it ever-restless motion .
But when the mother ask whether her poor lose child have stop to drink out of the fountain , the naiad , with weep eye -LRB- for these water-nymphs have tear to spare for everybody 's grief -RRB- , would answer `` No ! ''
in a murmuring voice , which be just like the murmur of the stream .
Often , likewise , she encounter faun , who look like sunburnt country people , except that they have hairy ear , and little horn upon their forehead , and the hinder leg of goat , on which they gambol merrily about the wood and field .
They be a frolicsome kind of creature but grow as sad a their cheerful disposition would allow , when Ceres inquire for her daughter , and they have no good news to tell .
But sometimes she same suddenly upon a rude gang of satyr , who have face like monkey , and horse ' tail behind them , and who be generally dance in a very boisterous manner , with shout of noisy laughter .
When she stop to question them , they would only laugh the louder , and make new merriment out of the lone woman 's distress .
How unkind of those ugly satyr !
And once , while cross a solitary sheep pasture , she saw a personage name Pan , seat at the foot of a tall rock , and make music on a shepherd 's flute .
He , too , have horn , and hairy ear , and goat ' foot ; but , be acquaint with Mother Ceres , he answer her question as civilly a he know how , and invite her to taste some milk and honey out of a wooden bowl .
But neither could Pan tell her what have become of Proserpina , any good than the rest of these wild people .
And thus Mother Ceres go wander about for nine long day and night , find no trace of Proserpina , unless it be now and then a withered flower ; and these she pick up and put in her bosom , because she fancy that they might have fall from her poor child 's hand .
All day she travel onward through the hot sun ; and , at night again , the flame of the torch would redden and gleam along the pathway , and she continue her search by it light , without ever sit down to rest .
On the tenth day , she chance to espy the mouth of a cavern within which -LRB- though it be bright noon everywhere else -RRB- there would have be only a dusky twilight ; but it so happen that a torch be burn there .
It flicker , and struggle with the duskiness , but could not half light up the gloomy cavern with all it melancholy glimmer .
Ceres be resolve to leave no spot without a search ; so she peep into the entrance of the cave , and light it up a little more , by hold her own torch before her .
In so do , she catch a glimpse of what seem to be a woman , sit on the brown leaf of the last autumn , a great heap of which have be sweep into the cave by the wind .
This woman -LRB- if woman it be -RRB- be by no mean so beautiful a many of her sex ; for her head , they tell me , be shape very much like a dog 's , and , by way of ornament , she wear a wreath of snake around it .
But Mother Ceres , the moment she saw her , know that this be an odd kind of a person , who put all her enjoyment in be miserable , and never would have a word to say to other people , unless they be a melancholy and wretched a she herself delight to be .
`` I be wretched enough now , '' think poor Ceres , `` to talk with this melancholy Hecate , be she ten time sadder than ever she be yet . ''
So she step into the cave , and sit down on the wither leaf by the dog-headed woman 's side .
In all the world , since her daughter 's loss , she have find no other companion .
`` O Hecate , '' say she , `` if ever you lose a daughter , you will know what sorrow be .
Tell me , for pity 's sake , have you see my poor child Proserpina pas by the mouth of your cavern ? ''
`` No , '' answer Hecate , in a cracked voice , and sigh betwixt every word or two ; `` no , Mother Ceres , I have see nothing of your daughter .
But my ear , you must know , be make in such a way , that all cry of distress and affright all over the world be pretty sure to find their way to them ; and nine day ago , a I sit in my cave , make myself very miserable , I hear the voice of a young girl , shriek a if in great distress .
Something terrible have happen to the child , you may rest assure .
As well a I could judge , a dragon , or some other cruel monster , be carry her away . ''
`` You kill me by say so , '' cry Ceres , almost ready to faint .
`` Where be the sound , and which way do it seem to go ? ''
`` It pass very swiftly along , '' say Hecate , `` and , at the same time , there be a heavy rumbling of wheel towards the eastward .
I can tell you nothing more , except that , in my honest opinion , you will never see your daughter again .
The best advice I can give you be , to take up your abode in this cavern , where we will be the two most wretched woman in the world . ''
`` Not yet , dark Hecate , '' reply Ceres .
`` But do you first come with your torch , and help me to seek for my lose child .
And when there shall be no more hope of find her -LRB- if that black day be ordain to come -RRB- , then , if you will give me room to fling myself down , either on these wither leaf or on the naked rock , I will show what it be to be miserable .
But , until I know that she have perish from the face of the earth , I will not allow myself space even to grieve . ''
The dismal Hecate do not much like the idea of go abroad into the sunny world .
But then she reflect that the sorrow of the disconsolate Ceres would be like a gloomy twilight round about them both , let the sun shine ever so brightly , and that therefore she might enjoy her bad spirit quite as well a if she be to stay in the cave .
So she finally consent to go , and they set out together , both carry torch , although it be broad daylight and clear sunshine .
The torchlight seem to make a gloom ; so that the people whom they meet , along the road , could not very distinctly see their figure ; and , indeed , if they once catch a glimpse of Hecate , with the wreath of snake round her forehead , they generally think it prudent to run away , without wait for a second glance .
As the pair travel along in this woe-begone manner , a thought struck Ceres .
`` There be one person , '' she exclaim , `` who must have see my poor child , and can doubtless tell what have become of her .
Why do not I think of him before ?
It be Phoebus . ''
`` What , '' say Hecate , `` the young man that always sit in the sunshine ?
O , pray do not think of go near him .
He be a gay , light , frivolous young fellow , and will only smile in your face .
And besides , there be such a glare of the sun about him , that he will quite blind my poor eye , which I have almost weep away already . ''
`` You have promise to be my companion , '' answer Ceres .
`` Come , let u make haste , or the sunshine will be go , and Phoebus along with it . ''
Accordingly , they go along in quest of Phoebus , both of them sigh grievously , and Hecate , to say the truth , make a great deal bad lamentation than Ceres ; for all the pleasure she have , you know , lay in be miserable , and therefore she make the most of it .
By and by , after a pretty long journey , they arrive at the sunny spot in the whole world .
There they behold a beautiful young man , with long , curl ringlet , which seem to be make of golden sunbeam ; his garment be like light summer cloud ; and the expression of his face be so exceedingly vivid , that Hecate hold her hand before her eye , mutter that he ought to wear a black veil .
Phoebus -LRB- for this be the very person whom they be seek -RRB- have a lyre in his hand , and be make it chord tremble with sweet music ; at the same time sing a most exquisite song , which he have recently compose .
For , beside a great many other accomplishment , this young man be renowned for his admirable poetry .
As Ceres and her dismal companion approach him , Phoebus smile on them so cheerfully that Hecate 's wreath of snake give a spiteful hiss , and Hecate heartily wish herself back in her cave .
But a for Ceres , she be too earnest in her grief either to know or care whether Phoebus smile or frown .
`` Phoebus ! ''
exclaim she , `` I be in great trouble , and have come to you for assistance .
Can you tell me what have become of my dear child Proserpina ? ''
`` Proserpina !
Proserpina , do you call her name ? ''
answer Phoebus , endeavor to recollect ; for there be such a continual flow of pleasant idea in his mind , that he be apt to forget what have happen no longer ago than yesterday .
`` Ah , yes , I remember her now .
A very lovely child , indeed .
I be happy to tell you , my dear madam , that I do see the little Proserpina not many day ago .
You may make yourself perfectly easy about her .
She be safe , and in excellent hand . ''
`` O , where be my dear child ? ''
cried Ceres , clasp her hand , and fling herself at his foot .
`` Why , '' say Phoebus -- and a he speak he keep touch his lyre so a to make a thread of music run in and out among his word -- `` a the little damsel be gather flower -LRB- and she have really a very exquisite taste for flower -RRB- , she be suddenly snatch up by King Pluto , and carry off to his dominion .
I have never be in that part of the universe ; but the royal palace , I be told , be build in a very noble style of architecture , and of the most splendid and costly material .
Gold , diamonds , pearl , and all manner of precious stone will be your daughter 's ordinary plaything .
I recommend to you , my dear lady , to give yourself no uneasiness .
Proserpina 's sense of beauty will be duly gratify , and even in spite of the lack of sunshine , she will lead a very enviable life . ''
`` Hush !
Say not such a word ! ''
answered Ceres , indignantly .
`` What be there to gratify her heart ?
What be all the splendor you speak of without affection ?
I must have her back again .
Will you go with me you go with me , Phoebus , to demand my daughter of this wicked Pluto ? ''
`` Pray excuse me , '' reply Phoebus , with an elegant obeisance .
`` I certainly wish you success , and regret that my own affair be so immediately press that I can not have the pleasure of attend you .
Besides , I be not upon the best of term with King Pluto .
To tell you the truth , his three-headed mastiff would never let me pass the gateway ; for I should be compel to take a sheaf of sunbeam along with me , and those , you know , be forbidden thing in Pluto 's kingdom . ''
`` Ah , Phoebus , '' say Ceres , with bitter meaning in her word , `` you have a harp instead of a heart .
Farewell . ''
`` Will not you stay a moment , '' ask Phoebus , `` and hear me turn the pretty and touch story of Proserpina into extemporary verse ? ''
But Ceres shake her head , and hasten away , along with Hecate .
Phoebus -LRB- who , a I have tell you , be an exquisite poet -RRB- forthwith begin to make an ode about the poor mother 's grief ; and , if we be to judge of his sensibility by this beautiful production , he must have be endow with a very tender heart .
But when a poet get into the habit of use his heartstrings to make chord for his lyre , he may thrum upon them as much a he will , without any great pain to himself .
Accordingly , though Phoebus sing a very sad song , he be a merry all the while a be the sunbeam amid which he dwell .
Poor Mother Ceres have now find out what have become of her daughter , but be not a whit happy than before .
Her case , on the contrary , look more desperate than ever .
As long a Proserpina be above ground , there might have be hope of regain her .
But now that the poor child be shut up within the iron gate of the king of the mine , at the threshold of which lay the three-headed Cerberus , there seem no possibility of her ever make her escape .
The dismal Hecate , who love to take the dark view of thing , tell Ceres that she have well come with her to the cavern , and spend the rest of her life in be miserable .
Ceres answer , that Hecate be welcome to go back thither herself , but that , for her part , she would wander about the earth in quest of the entrance to King Pluto 's dominion .
And Hecate take her at her word , and hurry back to her beloved cave , frighten a great many little child with a glimpse of her dog 's face a she go .
Poor Mother Ceres !
It be melancholy to think of her , pursue her toilsome way , all alone , and hold up that never-dying torch , the flame of which seem an emblem of the grief and hope that burn together in her heart .
So much do she suffer , that , though her aspect have be quite youthful when her trouble begin , she grow to look like an elderly person in a very brief time .
She care not how she be dress , nor have she ever think of fling away the wreath of withered poppy , which she put on the very morning of Proserpina 's disappearance .
She roam about in so wild a way , and with her hair so disheveled , that people take her for some distracted creature , and never dream that this be Mother Ceres , who have the oversight of every seed which the husbandman plant .
Nowadays , however , she give herself no trouble about seed time nor harvest , but leave the farmer to take care of their own affair , and the crop to fade or flourish , a the case might be .
There be nothing , now , in which Ceres seem to feel an interest , unless when she saw child at play , or gather flower along the wayside .
Then , indeed , she would stand and gaze at them with tear in her eye .
The child , too , appear to have a sympathy with her grief , and would cluster themselves in a little group about her knee , and look up wistfully in her face ; and Ceres , after give them a kiss all round , would lead them to their home , and advise their mother never to let them stray out of sight .
`` For if they do , '' say she , `` it may happen to you , a it have to me , that the iron-hearted King Pluto will take a liking to your darling , and snatch them up in his chariot , and carry them away . ''
One day , during her pilgrimage in quest of the entrance to Pluto 's kingdom , she come to the palace of King Cereus , who reign at Eleusis .
Ascending a lofty flight of step , she enter the portal , and find the royal household in very great alarm about the queen 's baby .
The infant , it seem , be sickly -LRB- be trouble with it teeth , I suppose -RRB- , and would take no food , and be all the time moan with pain .
The queen -- her name be Metanira -- be desirous of fund a nurse ; and when she behold a woman of matronly aspect come up the palace step , she think , in her own mind , that here be the very person whom she need .
So Queen Metanira ran to the door , with the poor wailing baby in her arm , and beseech Ceres to take charge of it , or , at least , to tell her what would do it good .
`` Will you trust the child entirely to me ? ''
ask Ceres .
`` Yes , and gladly , too , '' answer the queen , `` if you will devote all your time to him .
For I can see that you have be a mother . ''
`` You be right , '' say Ceres .
`` I once have a child of my own .
Well ; I will be the nurse of this poor , sickly boy .
But beware , I warn you , that you do not interfere with any kind of treatment which I may judge proper for him .
If you do so , the poor infant must suffer for his mother 's folly . ''
Then she kiss the child , and it seem to do him good ; for he smile and nestle closely into her bosom .
So Mother Ceres set her torch in a corner -LRB- where it keep burn all the while -RRB- , and take up her abode in the palace of King Cereus , a nurse to the little Prince Demophoon .
She treat him a if he be her own child , and allow neither the king nor the queen to say whether he should be bath in warm or cold water , or what he should eat , or how often he should take the air , or when he should be put to bed .
You would hardly believe me , if I be to tell how quickly the baby prince get rid of his ailment , and grow fat , and rosy , and strong , and how he have two row of ivory teeth in less time than any other little fellow , before or since .
Instead of the palest , and wretched , and puny imp in the world -LRB- a his own mother confess him to be , when Ceres first take him in charge -RRB- , he be now a strapping baby , crow , laugh , kick up his heel , and roll from one end of the room to the other .
All the good woman of the neighborhood crowd to the palace , and hold up their hand , in unutterable amazement , at the beauty and wholesomeness of this darling little prince .
Their wonder be the great , because he be never see to taste any food ; not even so much a a cup of milk .
`` Pray , nurse , '' the queen kept say , `` how be it that you make the child thrive so ? ''
`` I be a mother once , '' Ceres always reply ; `` and have nurse my own child , I know what other child need . ''
But Queen Metanira , a be very natural , have a great curiosity to know precisely what the nurse do to her child .
One night , therefore , she hide herself in the chamber where Ceres and the little prince be accustom to sleep .
There be a fire in the chimney , and it have now crumble into great coal and ember , which lay glow on the hearth , with a blaze flicker up now and then , and fling a warm and ruddy light upon the wall .
Ceres sit before the hearth with the child in her lap , and the firelight make her shadow dance upon the ceiling overhead .
She undress the little prince , and bath him all over with some fragrant liquid out of a vase .
The next thing she do be to rake back the red ember , and make a hollow place among them , just where the backlog have be .
At last , while the baby be crow , and clap it fat little hand , and laugh in the nurse 's face -LRB- just a you may have see your little brother or sister do before go into it warm bath -RRB- , Ceres suddenly lay him , all naked a he be , in the hollow among the red-hot ember .
She then rake the ash over him , and turn quietly away .
You may imagine , if you can , how Queen Metanira shriek , think nothing less than that her dear child would be burn to a cinder .
She burst forth from her hiding-place , and run to the hearth , rake open the fire , and snatch up poor little Prince Demophoon out of his bed of live coal , one of which he be grip in each of his fist .
He immediately set up a grievous cry , a baby be apt to do , when rudely startle out of a sound sleep .
To the queen 's astonishment and joy , she could perceive no token of the child 's be injure by the hot fire in which he have lain .
She now turn to Mother Ceres , and ask her to explain the mystery .
`` Foolish woman , '' answer Ceres , `` do you not promise to intrust this poor infant entirely to me ?
You little know the mischief you have do him .
Had you leave him to my care , he would have grow up like a child of celestial birth , endow with superhuman strength and intelligence , and would have live forever .
Do you imagine that earthly child be to become immortal without be temper to it in the fierce heat of the fire ?
But you have ruin your own son .
For though he will be a strong man and a hero in his day , yet , on account of your folly , he will grow old , and finally die , like the son of other woman .
The weak tenderness of his mother have cost the poor boy an immortality .
Farewell . ''
Saying these word , she kiss the little Prince Demophoon , and sigh to think what he have lose , and take her departure without heed Queen Metanira , who entreat her to remain , and cover up the child among the hot ember as often a she please .
Poor baby !
He never sleep so warmly again .
While she dwell in the king 's palace , Mother Ceres have be so continually occupy with take care of the young prince , that her heart be a little lightened of it grief for Proserpina .
But now , have nothing else to busy herself about , she become just as wretched a before .
At length , in her despair , she come to the dreadful resolution that not a stalk of grain , nor a blade of grass , not a potato , nor a turnip , nor any other vegetable that be good for man or beast to eat , should be suffer to grow until her daughter be restore .
She even forbid the flower to bloom , l somebody 's heart should be cheer by their beauty .
Now , a not so much a a head of asparagus ever presume to poke itself out of the ground , without the especial permission of Ceres , you may conceive what a terrible calamity have here fall upon the earth .
The husbandman plow and plant a usual ; but there lay the rich black furrow , all as barren a a desert of sand .
The pasture look a brown in the sweet month of June a ever they do in chill November .
The rich man 's broad acre and the cottager 's small garden patch be equally blight .
Every little girl 's flower bed show nothing but dry stalk .
The old people shake their white head , and say that the earth have grow age like themselves , and be no longer capable of wear the warm smile of summer on it face .
It be really piteous to see the poor , starve cattle and sheep , how they follow behind Ceres , low and bleating , a if their instinct teach them to expect help from her ; and everybody that be acquaint with her power beseech her to have mercy on the human race , and , at all event , to let the grass grow .
But Mother Ceres , though naturally of an affectionate disposition , be now inexorable .
`` Never , '' say she .
`` If the earth be ever again to see any verdure , it must first grow along the path which my daughter will tread in come back to me . ''
Finally , a there seem to be no other remedy , our old friend Quicksilver be send post-haste to King Pluto , in hope that he might be persuade to undo the mischief he have do , and to set everything right again , by give up Proserpina .
Quicksilver accordingly make the best of his way to the great gate , take a fly leap right over the three-headed mastiff , and stand at the door of the palace in an inconceivably short time .
The servant know him both by his face and garb ; for his short cloak , and his winged cap and shoe , and his snaky staff have often be see thereabouts in time go by .
He request to be show immediately into the king 's presence ; and Pluto , who hear his voice from the top of the stair , and who love to recreate himself with Quicksilver 's merry talk , call out to him to come up .
And while they settle their business together , we must inquire what Proserpina have be do ever since we saw her last .
The child have declare , a you may remember , that she would not taste a mouthful of food as long a she should be compel to remain in King Pluto 's palace .
How she contrive to maintain her resolution , and at the same time to keep herself tolerably plump and rosy , be more than I can explain ; but some young lady , I be give to understand , possess the faculty of living on air , and Proserpina seem to have possess it too .
At any rate , it be now six month since she leave the outside of the earth ; and not a morsel , so far a the attendant be able to testify , have yet pass between her teeth .
This be the more creditable to Proserpina , inasmuch a King Pluto have cause her to be tempt day by day , with all manner of sweetmeat , and richly-preserved fruit , and delicacy of every sort , such a young people be generally most fond of .
But her good mother have often tell her of the hurtfulness of these thing ; and for that reason alone , if there have be no other , she would have resolutely refuse to taste them .
All this time , be of a cheerful and active disposition , the little damsel be not quite so unhappy a you may have suppose .
The immense palace have a thousand room , and be full of beautiful and wonderful object .
There be a never-ceasing gloom , it be true , which half hide itself among the innumerable pillar , glide before the child a she wander among them , and tread stealthily behind her in the echo of her footstep .
Neither be all the dazzle of the precious stone , which flame with their own light , worth one gleam of natural sunshine ; nor could the most brilliant of the many-colored gem , which Proserpina have for plaything , vie with the simple beauty of the flower she use to gather .
But still , whenever the girl go among those gilded hall and chamber , it seem a if she carry nature and sunshine along with her , and a if she scatter dewy blossom on her right hand and on her left .
After Proserpina come , the palace be no longer the same abode of stately artifice and dismal magnificence that it have before be .
The inhabitant all felt this , and King Pluto more than any of them .
`` My own little Proserpina , '' he use to say .
`` I wish you could like me a little good .
We gloomy and cloudy-natured person have often a warm heart , at bottom , a those of a more cheerful character .
If you would only stay with me of your own accord , it would make me happy than the possession of a hundred such palace a this . ''
`` Ah , '' say Proserpina , `` you should have try to make me like you before carry me off .
And the best thing you can now do be , to let me go again .
Then I might remember you sometimes , and think that you be as kind a you know how to be .
Perhaps , too , one day or other , I might come back , and pay you a visit . ''
`` No , no , '' answer Pluto , with his gloomy smile , `` I will not trust you for that .
You be too fond of living in the broad daylight , and gather flower .
What an idle and childish taste that be !
Are not these gem , which I have order to be dig for you , and which be rich than any in my crown -- be they not pretty than a violet ? ''
`` Not half so pretty , '' say Proserpina , snatch the gem from Pluto 's hand , and fling them to the other end of the hall .
`` O my sweet violet , shall I never see you again ? ''
And then she burst into tear .
But young people 's tear have very little saltness or acidity in them , and do not inflame the eye so much a those of grown person ; so that it be not to be wonder at , if , a few moment afterwards , Proserpina be sport through the hall almost as merrily a she and the four sea nymph have sport along the edge of the surf wave .
King Pluto gaze after her , and wish that he , too , be a child .
And little Proserpina , when she turn about , and behold this great king standing in his splendid hall , and look so grand , and so melancholy , and so lonesome , be smite with a kind of pity .
She run back to him , and , for the first time in all her life , put her small , soft hand in his .
`` I love you a little , '' whisper she , look up in his face .
`` Do you , indeed , my dear child ? ''
cried Pluto , bend his dark face down to kiss her ; but Proserpina shrink away from the kiss , for , though his feature be noble , they be very dusky and grim .
`` Well , I have not deserve it of you , after keep you a prisoner for so many month , and starve you besides .
Are you not terribly hungry ?
Is there nothing which I can get you to eat ? ''
In ask this question , the king of the mine have a very cunning purpose ; for , you will recollect , if Proserpina taste a morsel of food in his dominion , she would never afterwards be at liberty to quit them .
`` No indeed , '' say Proserpina .
`` Your head cook be always baking , and stewing , and roasting , and roll out paste , and contrive one dish or another , which he imagine may be to my liking .
But he might just as well save himself the trouble , poor , fat little man that he be .
I have no appetite for anything in the world , unless it be a slice of bread , of my mother 's own baking , or a little fruit out of her garden . ''
When Pluto hear this , he begin to see that he have mistake the best method of tempt Proserpina to eat .
The cook 's make dish and artificial dainty be not half so delicious , in the good child 's opinion , a the simple fare to which Mother Ceres have accustom her .
Wondering that he have never think of it before , the king now send one of his trusty attendant with a large basket , to get some of the fine and juicy pear , peach , and plum which could anywhere be find in the upper world .
Unfortunately , however , this be during the time when Ceres have forbid any fruit or vegetable to grow ; and , after seek all over the earth , King Pluto 's servant find only a single pomegranate , and that so dry up a not to be worth eat .
Nevertheless , since there be no good to be have , he bring this dry , old wither pomegranate home to the palace , put it on a magnificent golden salver , and carry it up to Proserpina .
Now , it happen , curiously enough , that , just a the servant be bring the pomegranate into the back door of the palace , our friend Quicksilver have go up the front step , on his errand to get Proserpina away from King Pluto .
As soon a Proserpina saw the pomegranate on the golden salver , she tell the servant he have well take it away again .
`` I shall not touch it , I assure you , '' say she .
`` If I be ever so hungry , I should never think of eat such a miserable , dry pomegranate a that . ''
`` It be the only one in the world , '' say the servant .
He set down the golden salver , with the wizened pomegranate upon it , and leave the room .
When he be go , Proserpina could not help come close to the table , and look at this poor specimen of dried fruit with a great deal of eagerness ; for , to say the truth , on see something that suit her taste , she felt all the six month ' appetite take possession of her at once .
To be sure , it be a very wretched-looking pomegranate , and seem to have no more juice in it than an oyster shell .
But there be no choice of such thing in King Pluto 's palace .
This be the first fruit she have see there , and the last she be ever likely to see ; and unless she eat it up immediately , it would grow dry than it already be , and be wholly unfit to eat .
`` At least , I may smell it , '' think Proserpina .
So she take up the pomegranate , and apply it to her nose ; and , somehow or other , be in such close neighborhood to her mouth , the fruit find it way into that little red cave .
Dear me !
what an everlasting pity !
Before Proserpina know what she be about , her teeth have actually bite it , of their own accord .
Just a this fatal deed be do , the door of the apartment open , and in come King Pluto , follow by Quicksilver , who have be urge him to let his little prisoner go .
At the first noise of their entrance , Proserpina withdraw the pomegranate from her mouth .
But Quicksilver -LRB- whose eye be very keen , and his wit the sharp that ever anybody have -RRB- perceive that the child be a little confused ; and see the empty salver , he suspect that she have be take a sly nibble of something or other .
As for honest Pluto , he never guess at the secret .
`` My little Proserpina , '' say the king , sit down , and affectionately draw her between his knee , `` here be Quicksilver , who tell me that a great many misfortune have befall innocent people on account of my detain you in my dominion .
To confess the truth , I myself have already reflect that it be an unjustifiable act to take you away from your good mother .
But , then , you must consider , my dear child , that this vast palace be apt to be gloomy -LRB- although the precious stone certainly shine very bright -RRB- , and that I be not of the most cheerful disposition , and that therefore it be a natural thing enough to seek for the society of some merry creature than myself .
I hop you would take my crown for a plaything , and me -- ah , you laugh , naughty Proserpina -- me , grim a I be , for a playmate .
It be a silly expectation . ''
`` Not so extremely silly , '' whisper Proserpina .
`` You have really amuse me very much , sometimes . ''
`` Thank you , '' say King Pluto , rather dryly .
`` But I can see plainly enough , that you think my palace a dusky prison , and me the iron-hearted keeper of it .
And an iron heart I should surely have , if I could detain you here any longer , my poor child , when it be now six month since you taste food .
I give you your liberty .
Go with Quicksilver .
Hasten home to your dear mother . ''
Now , although you may not have suppose it , Proserpina find it impossible to take leave of poor King Pluto without some regret , and a good deal of compunction for not tell him about the pomegranate .
She even shed a tear or two , think how lonely and cheerless the great palace would seem to him , with all it ugly glare of artificial light , after she herself -- his one little ray of natural sunshine , whom he have steal , to be sure , but only because he value her so much -- after she should have depart .
I know not how many kind thing she might have say to the disconsolate king of the mine , have not Quicksilver hurry her way .
`` Come along quickly , '' whisper he in her ear , `` or his majesty may change his royal mind .
And take care , above all thing , that you say nothing of what be bring you on the golden salver . ''
In a very short time , they have pass the great gateway -LRB- leave the three-headed Cerberus , barking , and yelping , and growling , with threefold din , behind them -RRB- , and emerge upon the surface of the earth .
It be delightful to behold , a Proserpina hasten along , how the path grow verdant behind and on either side of her .
Wherever she set her blessed foot , there be at once a dewy flower .
The violet gush up along the wayside .
The grass and the grain begin to sprout with tenfold vigor and luxuriance , to make up for the dreary month that have be waste in barrenness .
The starved cattle immediately set to work grazing , after their long fast , and ate enormously , all day , and get up at midnight to eat more .
But I can assure you it be a busy time of year with the farmer , when they find the summer come upon them with such a rush .
Nor must I forget to say , that all the bird in the whole world hop about upon the newly-blossoming tree , and sang together , in a prodigious ecstasy of joy .
Mother Ceres have return to her deserted home , and be sit disconsolately on the doorstep , with her torch burning in her hand .
She have be idly watch the flame for some moment past , when , all at once , it flicker and go out .
`` What do this mean ? ''
think she .
`` It be an enchanted torch , and should have keep burn till my child come back . ''
Lifting her eye , she be surprised to see a sudden verdure flashing over the brown and barren field , exactly a you may have observe a golden hue gleam far and wide across the landscape , from the just rise sun .
`` Does the earth disobey me ? ''
exclaim Mother Ceres , indignantly .
`` Does it presume to be green , when I have bid it be barren , until my daughter shall be restore to my arm ? ''
`` Then open your arm , dear mother , '' cry a well-known voice , `` and take your little daughter into them . ''
And Proserpina come run , and fling herself upon her mother 's bosom .
Their mutual transport be not to be describe .
The grief of their separation have cause both of them to shed a great many tear ; and now they shed a great many more , because their joy could not so well express itself in any other way .
When their heart have grow a little more quiet , Mother Ceres look anxiously at Proserpina .
`` My child , '' say she , `` do you taste any food while you be in King Pluto 's palace ? ''
`` Dearest mother , '' exclaim Proserpina , `` I will tell you the whole truth .
Until this very morning , not a morsel of food have pass my lip .
But to-day , they bring me a pomegranate -LRB- a very dry one it be , and all shrivel up , till there be little left of it but seed and skin -RRB- , and have see no fruit for so long a time , and be faint with hunger , I be tempt just to bite it .
The instant I taste it , King Pluto and Quicksilver come into the room .
I have not swallow a morsel ; but -- dear mother , I hope it be no harm -- but six of the pomegranate seed , I be afraid , remain in my mouth . ''
`` Ah , unfortunate child , and miserable me ! ''
exclaimed Ceres .
`` For each of those six pomegranate seed you must spend one month of every year in King Pluto 's palace .
You be but half restore to your mother .
Only six month with me , and six with that good-for-nothing King of Darkness ! ''
`` Do not speak so harshly of poor King Pluto , '' say Prosperina , kiss her mother .
`` He have some very good quality ; and I really think I can bear to spend six month in his palace , if he will only let me spend the other six with you .
He certainly do very wrong to carry me off ; but then , a he say , it be but a dismal sort of life for him , to live in that great gloomy place , all alone ; and it have make a wonderful change in his spirit to have a little girl to run up stair and down .
There be some comfort in make him so happy ; and so , upon the whole , dear mother , let u be thankful that he be not to keep me the whole year round . ''
THE GOLDEN FLEECE .
When Jason , the son of the dethroned King of Iolchos , be a little boy , he be send away from his parent , and place under the queer schoolmaster that ever you hear of .
This learn person be one of the people , or quadruped , call Centaurs .
He live in a cavern , and have the body and leg of a white horse , with the head and shoulder of a man .
His name be Chiron ; and , in spite of his odd appearance , he be a very excellent teacher , and have several scholar , who afterwards do him credit by make a great figure in the world .
The famous Hercules be one , and so be Achilles , and Philoctetes likewise , and Aesculapius , who acquire immense repute a a doctor .
The good Chiron teach his pupils how to play upon the harp , and how to cure disease , and how to use the sword and shield , together with various other branch of education , in which the lad of those day use to be instruct , instead of write and arithmetic .
I have sometimes suspect that Master Chiron be not really very different from other people , but that , be a kind-hearted and merry old fellow , he be in the habit of make believe that he be a horse , and scramble about the schoolroom on all four , and let the little boys ride upon his back .
And so , when his scholar have grow up , and grown old , and be trot their grandchild on their knee , they tell them about the sport of their school day ; and these young folk take the idea that their grandfather have be teach their letter by a Centaur , half man and half horse .
Little child , not quite understand what be say to them , often get such absurd notion into their head , you know .
Be that a it may , it have always be tell for a fact -LRB- and always will be tell , as long a the world last -RRB- , that Chiron , with the head of a schoolmaster , have the body and leg of a horse .
Just imagine the grave old gentleman clattering and stamp into the schoolroom on his four hoof , perhaps tread on some little fellow 's toe , flourish his switch tail instead of a rod , and , now and then , trot out of door to eat a mouthful of grass !
I wonder what the blacksmith charge him for a set of iron shoe ?
So Jason dwelt in the cave , with this four-footed Chiron , from the time that he be an infant , only a few month old , until he have grow to the full height of a man .
He become a very good harper , I suppose , and skilful in the use of weapon , and tolerably acquaint with herb and other doctor 's stuff , and , above all , an admirable horseman ; for , in teach young people to ride , the good Chiron must have be without a rival among schoolmaster .
At length , be now a tall and athletic youth , Jason resolve to seek his fortune in the world , without ask Chiron 's advice , or tell him anything about the matter .
This be very unwise , to be sure ; and I hope none of you , my little hearer , will ever follow Jason 's example .
But , you be to understand , he have hear how that he himself be a prince royal , and how his father , King Jason , have be deprive of the kingdom of Iolchos by a certain Pelias , who would also have kill Jason , have he not be hide in the Centaur 's cave .
And , be come to the strength of a man , Jason determine to set all this business to right , and to punish the wicked Pelias for wrong his dear father , and to cast him down from the throne , and seat himself there instead .
With this intention , he take a spear in each hand , and throw a leopard 's skin over his shoulder , to keep off the rain , and set forth on his travel , with his long yellow ringlet wave in the wind .
The part of his dress on which he most pride himself be a pair of sandal , that have be his father 's .
They be handsomely embroider , and be tie upon his foot with string of gold .
But his whole attire be such a people do not very often see ; and a he pass along , the woman and child run to the door and window , wonder whither this beautiful youth be journey , with his leopard 's skin and his golden-tied sandal , and what heroic deeds he mean to perform , with a spear in his right hand and another in his left .
I know not how far Jason have travel , when he come to a turbulent river , which rush right across his pathway , with speck of white foam among it black eddy , hurry tumultuously onward , and roar angrily a it go .
Though not a very broad river in the dry season of the year , it be now swell by heavy rain and by the melting of the snow on the side of Mount Olympus ; and it thunder so loudly , and look so wild and dangerous , that Jason , bold a he be , think it prudent to pause upon the brink .
The bed of the stream seem to be strew with sharp and rugged rock , some of which thrust themselves above the water .
By and by , an uprooted tree , with shattered branch , come drift along the current , and get entangle among the rock .
Now and then , a drowned sheep , and once the carcass of a cow , float past .
In short , the swollen river have already do a great deal of mischief .
It be evidently too deep for Jason to wade , and too boisterous for him to swim ; he could see no bridge ; and a for a boat , have there be any , the rock would have break it to piece in an instant .
`` See the poor lad , '' say a cracked voice close to his side .
`` He must have have but a poor education , since he do not know how to cross a little stream like this .
Or be he afraid of wet his fine golden-stringed sandal ?
It be a pity his four-footed schoolmaster be not here to carry him safely across on his back ! ''
Jason look round greatly surprised , for he do not know that anybody be near .
But beside him stand an old woman , with a ragged mantle over her head , lean on a staff , the top of which be carve into the shape of a cuckoo .
She look very age , and wrinkle , and infirm ; and yet her eye , which be as brown a those of an ox , be so extremely large and beautiful , that , when they be fix on Jason 's eye , he could see nothing else but them .
The old woman have a pomegranate in her hand , although the fruit be then quite out of season .
`` Whither be you go , Jason ? ''
she now ask .
She seem to know his name , you will observe ; and , indeed , those great brown eye look a if they have a knowledge of everything , whether past or to come .
While Jason be gaze at her , a peacock strut forward , and take his stand at the old woman 's side .
`` I be go to Iolchos , '' answer the young man , `` to bid the wicked King Pelias come down from my father 's throne , and let me reign in his stead . ''
`` Ah , well , then , '' say the old woman , still with the same cracked voice , `` if that be all your business , you need not be in a very great hurry .
Just take me on your back , there 's a good youth , and carry me across the river .
I and my peacock have something to do on the other side , as well a yourself . ''
`` Good mother , '' reply Jason , `` your business can hardly be so important a the pull down a king from his throne .
Besides , a you may see for yourself , the river be very boisterous ; and if I should chance to stumble , it would sweep both of u away more easily than it have carry off yonder uprooted tree .
I would gladly help you if I could ; but I doubt whether I be strong enough to carry you across . ''
`` Then , '' say she , very scornfully , `` neither be you strong enough to pull King Pelias off his throne .
And , Jason , unless you will help an old woman at her need , you ought not to be a king .
What be king make for , save to succor the feeble and distress ?
But do a you please .
Either take me on your back , or with my poor old limb I shall try my best to struggle across the stream . ''
Saying this , the old woman poke with her staff in the river , a if to find the safe place in it rocky bed where she might make the first step .
But Jason , by this time , have grow ashamed of his reluctance to help her .
He felt that he could never forgive himself , if this poor feeble creature should come to any harm in attempt to wrestle against the headlong current .
The good Chiron , whether half horse or no , have teach him that the noble use of his strength be to assist the weak ; and also that he must treat every young woman a if she be his sister , and every old one like a mother .
Remembering these maxim , the vigorous and beautiful young man kneel down , and request the good dame to mount upon his back .
`` The passage seem to me not very safe , '' he remark .
`` But a your business be so urgent , I will try to carry you across .
If the river sweep you away , it shall take me too . ''
`` That , no doubt , will be a great comfort to both of u , '' quoth the old woman .
`` But never fear .
We shall get safely across . ''
So she throw her arm around Jason 's neck ; and lift her from the ground , he step boldly into the raging and foam current , and begin to stagger away from the shore .
As for the peacock , it alight on the old dame 's shoulder .
Jason 's two spear , one in each hand , keep him from stumble , and enable him to feel his way among the hidden rock ; although every instant , he expect that his companion and himself would go down the stream , together with the driftwood of shattered tree , and the carcass of the sheep and cow .
Down come the cold , snowy torrent from the steep side of Olympus , rag and thunder a if it have a real spite against Jason , or , at all event , be determine to snatch off his live burden from his shoulder .
When he be half way across , the uprooted tree -LRB- which I have already tell you about -RRB- break loose from among the rock , and bore down upon him , with all it splintered branch stick out like the hundred arm of the giant Briareus .
It rush past , however , without touch him .
But the next moment his foot be catch in a crevice between two rock , and stick there so fast , that , in the effort to get free , he lose one of his golden-stringed sandal .
At this accident Jason could not help utter a cry of vexation .
`` What be the matter , Jason ? ''
ask the old woman .
`` Matter enough , '' say the young man .
`` I have lose a sandal here among the rock .
And what sort of a figure shall I cut , at the court of King Pelias , with a golden-stringed sandal on one foot , and the other foot bare ! ''
`` Do not take it to heart , '' answer his companion cheerily .
`` You never meet with good fortune than in lose that sandal .
It satisfy me that you be the very person whom the Speaking Oak have be talk about . ''
There be no time , just then , to inquire what the Speaking Oak have say .
But the briskness of her tone encourage the young man ; and , besides , he have never in his life felt so vigorous and mighty a since take this old woman on his back .
Instead of be exhaust , he gather strength a he go on ; and , struggle up against the torrent , he at last gain the opposite shore , clamber up the bank , and set down the old dame and her peacock safely on the grass .
As soon a this be do , however , he could not help look rather despondently at his bare foot , with only a remnant of the golden string of the sandal clinging round his ankle .
`` You will get a handsomer pair of sandal by and by , '' say the old woman , with a kindly look out of her beautiful brown eye .
`` Only let King Pelias get a glimpse of that bare foot , and you shall see him turn as pale a ash , I promise you .
There be your path .
Go along , my good Jason , and my blessing go with you .
And when you sit on your throne remember the old woman whom you help over the river . ''
With these word , she hobble away , give him a smile over her shoulder a she depart .
Whether the light of her beautiful brown eye throw a glory round about her , or whatever the cause might be , Jason fancy that there be something very noble and majestic in her figure , after all , and that , though her gait seem to be a rheumatic hobble , yet she move with as much grace and dignity a any queen on earth .
Her peacock , which have now flutter down from her shoulder , strut behind her in a prodigious pomp , and spread out it magnificent tail on purpose for Jason to admire it .
When the old dame and her peacock be out of sight , Jason set forward on his journey .
After travel a pretty long distance , he come to a town situate at the foot of a mountain , and not a great way from the shore of the sea .
On the outside of the town there be an immense crowd of people , not only men and woman , but child too , all in their best clothes , and evidently enjoy a holiday .
The crowd be thick towards the sea-shore ; and in that direction , over the people 's head , Jason saw a wreath of smoke curl upward to the blue sky .
He inquire of one of the multitude what town it be near by , and why so many person be here assemble together .
`` This be the kingdom of Iolchos , '' answer the man , `` and we be the subject of King Pelias .
Our monarch have summon u together , that we may see him sacrifice a black bull to Neptune , who , they say , be his majesty 's father .
Yonder be the king , where you see the smoke go up from the altar . ''
While the man speak he eye Jason with great curiosity ; for his garb be quite unlike that of the Iolchians , and it look very odd to see a youth with a leopard 's skin over his shoulder , and each hand grasp a spear .
Jason perceive , too , that the man star particularly at his foot , one of which , you remember , be bare , while the other be decorate with his father 's golden-stringed sandal .
`` Look at him !
only look at him ! ''
say the man to his next neighbor .
`` Do you see ?
He wear but one sandal ! ''
Upon this , first one person , and then another , begin to stare at Jason , and everybody seem to be greatly strike with something in his aspect ; though they turn their eye much oftener towards his foot than to any other part of his figure .
Besides , he could hear them whisper to one another .
`` One sandal !
One sandal ! ''
they keep say .
`` The man with one sandal !
Here he be at last !
Whence have he come ?
What do he mean to do ?
What will the king say to the one-sandaled man ? ''
Poor Jason be greatly abash , and make up his mind that the people of Iolchos be exceedingly ill-bred , to take such public notice of an accidental deficiency in his dress .
Meanwhile , whether it be that they hustle him forward , or that Jason , of his own accord , thrust a passage through the crowd , it so happen that he soon find himself close to the smoking altar , where King Pelias be sacrifice the black bull .
The murmur and hum of the multitude , in their surprise at the spectacle of Jason with his one bare foot , grow so loud that it disturb the ceremony ; and the king , hold the great knife with which he be just go to cut the bull 's throat , turn angrily about , and fix his eye on Jason .
The people have now withdraw from around him , so that the youth stand in an open space , near the smoking altar , front to front with the angry King Pelias .
`` Who be you ? ''
cry the king , with a terrible frown .
`` And how dare you make this disturbance , while I be sacrifice a black bull to my father Neptune ? ''
`` It be no fault of mine , '' answer Jason .
`` Your majesty must blame the rudeness of your subject , who have raise all this tumult because one of my foot happen to be bare . ''
When Jason say this , the king give a quick startle glance down at his foot .
`` Ha ! ''
mutter he , `` here be the one-sandaled fellow , sure enough !
What can I do with him ? ''
And he clutch more closely the great knife in his hand , a if he be half a mind to slay Jason , instead of the black bull .
The people round about catch up the king 's word , indistinctly a they be utter ; and first there be a murmur amongst them , and then a loud shout .
`` The one-sandaled man have come !
The prophecy must be fulfil ! ''
For you be to know , that , many year before , King Pelias have be tell by the Speaking Oak of Dodona , that a man with one sandal should cast him down from his throne .
On this account , he have give strict order that nobody should ever come into his presence , unless both sandal be securely tie upon his foot ; and he keep an officer in his palace , whose sole business it be to examine people 's sandal , and to supply them with a new pair , at the expense of the royal treasury , as soon a the old one begin to wear out .
In the whole course of the king 's reign , he have never be throw into such a fright and agitation a by the spectacle of poor Jason 's bare foot .
But , a he be naturally a bold and hard-hearted man , he soon take courage , and begin to consider in what way he might rid himself of this terrible one-sandaled stranger .
`` My good young man , '' say King Pelias , take the soft tone imaginable , in order to throw Jason off his guard , `` you be excessively welcome to my kingdom .
Judging by your dress , you must have travel a long distance , for it be not the fashion to wear leopard skin in this part of the world .
Pray what may I call your name ?
and where do you receive your education ? ''
`` My name be Jason , '' answer the young stranger .
`` Ever since my infancy , I have dwell in the cave of Chiron the Centaur .
He be my instructor , and teach me music , and horsemanship , and how to cure wound , and likewise how to inflict wound with my weapon ! ''
`` I have hear of Chiron the schoolmaster , '' reply King Pelias , `` and how that there be an immense deal of learn and wisdom in his head , although it happen to be set on a horse 's body .
It give me great delight to see one of his scholar at my court .
But to test how much you have profit under so excellent a teacher , will you allow me to ask you a single question ? ''
`` I do not pretend to be very wise , '' say Jason .
`` But ask me what you please , and I will answer to the best of my ability . ''
Now King Pelias meant cunningly to entrap the young man , and to make him say something that should be the cause of mischief and distraction to himself .
So , with a crafty and evil smile upon his face , he speak a follow : `` What would you do , brave Jason , '' ask he , `` if there be a man in the world , by whom , a you have reason to believe , you be doom to be ruin and slay -- what would you do , I say , if that man stand before you , and in your power ? ''
When Jason saw the malice and wickedness which King Pelias could not prevent from gleam out of his eye , he probably guess that the king have discover what he come for , and that he intend to turn his own word against himself .
Still he scorn to tell a falsehood .
Like an upright and honorable prince a he be , he determine to speak out the real truth .
Since the king have choose to ask him the question , and since Jason have promise him an answer , there be no right way save to tell him precisely what would be the most prudent thing to do , if he have his bad enemy in his power .
Therefore , after a moment 's consideration , he speak up , with a firm and manly voice .
`` I would send such a man , '' say he , `` in quest of the Golden Fleece ! ''
This enterprise , you will understand , be , of all others , the most difficult and dangerous in the world .
In the first place it would be necessary to make a long voyage through unknown sea .
There be hardly a hope , or a possibility , that any young man who should undertake this voyage would either succeed in obtain the Golden Fleece , or would survive to return home , and tell of the peril he have run .
The eye of King Pelias sparkle with joy , therefore , when he hear Jason 's reply .
`` Well say , wise man with the one sandal ! ''
cry he .
`` Go , then , and at the peril of your life , bring me back the Golden Fleece . ''
`` I go , '' answer Jason , composedly .
`` If I fail , you need not fear that I will ever come back to trouble you again .
But if I return to Iolchos with the prize , then , King Pelias , you must hasten down from your lofty throne , and give me your crown and sceptre . ''
`` That I will , '' say the king , with a sneer .
`` Meantime , I will keep them very safely for you . ''
The first thing that Jason think of do , after he leave the king 's presence , be to go to Dodona , and inquire of the Talking Oak what course it be best to pursue .
This wonderful tree stand in the center of an ancient wood .
Its stately trunk rise up a hundred foot into the air , and throw a broad and dense shadow over more than an acre of ground .
Standing beneath it , Jason look up among the knot branch and green leaf , and into the mysterious heart of the old tree , and speak aloud , a if he be address some person who be hide in the depth of the foliage .
`` What shall I do , '' say he , `` in order to win the Golden Fleece ? ''
At first there be a deep silence , not only within the shadow of the Talking Oak , but all through the solitary wood .
In a moment or two , however , the leaf of the oak begin to stir and rustle , a if a gentle breeze be wander amongst them , although the other tree of the wood be perfectly still .
The sound grow loud , and become like the roar of a high wind .
By and by , Jason imagine that he could distinguish word , but very confusedly , because each separate leaf of the tree seem to be a tongue , and the whole myriad of tongue be babble at once .
But the noise wax broad and deep , until it resemble a tornado sweep through the oak , and make one great utterance out of the thousand and thousand of little murmur which each leafy tongue have cause by it rustling .
And now , though it still have the tone of a mighty wind roar among the branch , it be also like a deep bass voice , speaking as distinctly a a tree could be expect to speak , the following word : `` Go to Argus , the shipbuilder , and bid him build a galley with fifty oar . ''
Then the voice melt again into the indistinct murmur of the rustling leave , and die gradually away .
When it be quite go , Jason felt incline to doubt whether he have actually hear the word , or whether his fancy have not shape them out of the ordinary sound make by a breeze , while pass through the thick foliage of the tree .
But on inquiry among the people of Iolchos , he find that there be really a man in the city , by the name of Argus , who be a very skilful builder of vessel .
This show some intelligence in the oak ; else how should it have know that any such person exist ?
At Jason 's request , Argus readily consent to build him a galley so big that it should require fifty strong men to row it ; although no vessel of such a size and burden have heretofore be see in the world .
So the head carpenter and all his journeyman and apprentice begin their work ; and for a good while afterwards , there they be , busily employ , hew out the timber , and make a great clatter with their hammer ; until the new ship , which be call the Argo , seem to be quite ready for sea .
And , a the Talking Oak have already give him such good advice , Jason think that it would not be amiss to ask for a little more .
He visit it again , therefore , and stand beside it huge , rough trunk , inquire what he should do next .
This time , there be no such universal quivering of the leaf , throughout the whole tree , a there have be before .
But after a while , Jason observe that the foliage of a great branch which stretch above his head have begin to rustle , a if the wind be stir that one bough , while all the other bough of the oak be at rest .
`` Cut me off ! ''
say the branch , as soon a it could speak distinctly ; `` cut me off !
cut me off !
and carve me into a figure-head for your galley . ''
Accordingly , Jason take the branch at it word , and lop it off the tree .
A carver in the neighborhood engage to make the figurehead .
He be a tolerably good workman , and have already carve several figure-heads , in what he intend for feminine shape , and look pretty much like those which we see nowadays stick up under a vessel 's bowsprit , with great star eye , that never wink at the dash of the spray .
But -LRB- what be very strange -RRB- the carver find that his hand be guide by some unseen power , and by a skill beyond his own , and that his tool shape out an image which he have never dream of .
When the work be finish , it turn out to be the figure of a beautiful woman , with a helmet on her head , from beneath which the long ringlet fell down upon her shoulder .
On the left arm be a shield , and in it center appear a lifelike representation of the head of Medusa with the snaky lock .
The right arm be extend , a if point onward .
The face of this wonderful statue , though not angry or forbidding , be so grave and majestic , that perhaps you might call it severe ; and a for the mouth , it seem just ready to unclose it lip , and utter word of the deep wisdom .
Jason be delight with the oaken image , and give the carver no rest until it be complete , and set up where a figure-head have always stand , from that time to this , in the vessel 's prow .
`` And now , '' cry he , a he stand gaze at the calm , majestic face of the statue , `` I must go to the Talking Oak and inquire what next to do . ''
`` There be no need of that , Jason , '' say a voice which , though it be far low , remind him of the mighty tone of the great oak .
`` When you desire good advice , you can seek it of me . ''
Jason have be look straight into the face of the image when these word be speak .
But he could hardly believe either his ear or his eye .
The truth be , however , that the oaken lip have move , and , to all appearance , the voice have proceed from the statue 's mouth .
Recovering a little from his surprise , Jason bethink himself that the image have be carve out of the wood of the Talking Oak , and that , therefore , it be really no great wonder , but on the contrary , the most natural thing in the world , that it should possess the faculty of speech .
It would have be very odd , indeed , if it have not .
But certainly it be a great piece of good fortune that he should be able to carry so wise a block of wood along with him in his perilous voyage .
`` Tell me , wondrous image , '' exclaim Jason , -- `` since you inherit the wisdom of the Speaking Oak of Dodona , whose daughter you be , -- tell me , where shall I find fifty bold youth , who will take each of them an oar of my galley ?
They must have sturdy arm to row , and brave heart to encounter peril , or we shall never win the Golden Fleece . ''
`` Go , '' reply the oaken image , `` go , summon all the hero of Greece . ''
And , in fact , consider what a great deed be to be do , could any advice be wise than this which Jason receive from the figure-head of his vessel ?
He lose no time in send messenger to all the city , and make know to the whole people of Greece , that Prince Jason , the son of King Jason , be go in quest of the Fleece of Gold , and that he desire the help of forty-nine of the brave and strong young men alive , to row his vessel and share his danger .
And Jason himself would be the fiftieth .
At this news , the adventurous youth , all over the country , begin to bestir themselves .
Some of them have already fight with giant , and slain dragon ; and the young one , who have not yet meet with such good fortune , think it a shame to have live so long without get astride of a fly serpent , or stick their spear into a Chimaera , or , at least , thrust their right arm down a monstrous lion 's throat .
There be a fair prospect that they would meet with plenty of such adventure before find the Golden Fleece .
As soon a they could furbish up their helmet and shield , therefore , and gird on their trusty sword , they come throng to Iolchos , and clamber on board the new galley .
Shaking hand with Jason , they assure him that they do not care a pin for their life , but would help row the vessel to the remote edge of the world , and as much farther a he might think it best to go .
Many of these brave fellow have be educate by Chiron , the four-footed pedagogue , and be therefore old schoolmate of Jason , and know him to be a lad of spirit .
The mighty Hercules , whose shoulder afterwards upheld the sky , be one of them .
And there be Castor and Pollux , the twin brother , who be never accuse of be chicken-hearted , although they have be hatch out of an egg ; and Theseus , who be so renowned for kill the Minotaur , and Lynceus , with his wonderfully sharp eye , which could see through a millstone , or look right down into the depth of the earth , and discover the treasure that be there ; and Orpheus , the very best of harper , who sing and play upon his lyre so sweetly , that the brute beasts stand upon their hind leg , and caper merrily to the music .
Yes , and at some of his more moving tune , the rock bestir their moss-grown bulk out of the ground , and a grove of forest tree uproot themselves , and , nod their top to one another , perform a country dance .
One of the rower be a beautiful young woman , name Atalanta , who have be nurse among the mountain by a bear .
So light of foot be this fair damsel , that she could step from one foamy crest of a wave to the foamy crest of another , without wet more than the sole of her sandal .
She have grow up in a very wild way , and talk much about the right of woman , and love hunting and war far well than her needle .
But in my opinion , the most remarkable of this famous company be two son of the North Wind -LRB- airy youngster , and of rather a blustering disposition -RRB- who have wing on their shoulder , and , in case of a calm , could puff out their cheek , and blow almost a fresh a breeze a their father .
I ought not to forget the prophet and conjuror , of whom there be several in the crew , and who could foretell what would happen to-morrow or the next day , or a hundred year hence , but be generally quite unconscious of what be pass at the moment .
Jason appoint Tiphys to be helmsman because he be a star-gazer , and know the point of the compass .
Lynceus , on account of his sharp sight , be station a a look-out in the prow , where he saw a whole day 's sail ahead , but be rather apt to overlook thing that lay directly under his nose .
If the sea only happen to be deep enough , however , Lynceus could tell you exactly what kind of rock or sand be at the bottom of it ; and he often cry out to his companion , that they be sail over heap of sunken treasure , which yet he be none the richer for beholding .
To confess the truth , few people believe him when he say it .
Well !
But when the Argonauts , a these fifty brave adventurer be call , have prepare everything for the voyage , an unforeseen difficulty threaten to end it before it be begin .
The vessel , you must understand , be so long , and broad , and ponderous , that the united force of all the fifty be insufficient to shove her into the water .
Hercules , I suppose , have not grow to his full strength , else he might have set her afloat as easily a a little boy launch his boat upon a puddle .
But here be these fifty hero , push , and straining , and grow red in the face , without make the Argo start an inch .
At last , quite weary out , they sit themselves down on the shore exceedingly disconsolate , and think that the vessel must be leave to rot and fall in piece , and that they must either swim across the sea or lose the Golden Fleece .
All at once , Jason bethink himself of the galley 's miraculous figure-head .
`` O , daughter of the Talking Oak , '' cry he , `` how shall we set to work to get our vessel into the water ? ''
`` Seat yourselves , '' answer the image -LRB- for it have know what have ought to be do from the very first , and be only wait for the question to be put -RRB- , -- `` seat yourselves , and handle your oar , and let Orpheus play upon his harp . ''
Immediately the fifty hero get on board , and seize their oar , hold them perpendicularly in the air , while Orpheus -LRB- who like such a task far good than row -RRB- sweep his finger across the harp .
At the first ring note of the music , they felt the vessel stir .
Orpheus thrum away briskly , and the galley slide at once into the sea , dip her prow so deeply that the figure-head drank the wave with it marvelous lip , and rise again as buoyant a a swan .
The rower ply their fifty oar ; the white foam boil up before the prow ; the water gurgle and bubble in their wake ; while Orpheus continue to play so lively a strain of music , that the vessel seem to dance over the billow by way of keep time to it .
Thus triumphantly do the Argo sail out of the harbor , amidst the huzzas and good wish of everybody except the wicked old Pelias , who stand on a promontory , scowl at her , and wish that he could blow out of his lung the tempest of wrath that be in his heart , and so sink the galley with all on board .
When they have sail above fifty mile over the sea , Lynceus happen to cast his sharp eye behind , and say that there be this bad-hearted king , still perch upon the promontory , and scowl so gloomily that it look like a black thunder-cloud in that quarter of the horizon .
In order to make the time pass away more pleasantly during the voyage , the hero talk about the Golden Fleece .
It originally belong , it appear , to a Boeotian ram , who have take on his back two child , when in danger of their life , and flee with them over land and sea as far a Colchis .
One of the child , whose name be Helle , fell into the sea and be drown .
But the other -LRB- a little boy , name Phrixus -RRB- be bring safe ashore by the faithful ram , who , however , be so exhausted that he immediately lay down and die .
In memory of this good deed , and a a token of his true heart , the fleece of the poor dead ram be miraculously change to gold , and become one of the most beautiful object ever see on earth .
It be hang upon a tree in a sacred grove , where it have now be keep I know not how many year , and be the envy of mighty king , who have nothing so magnificent in any of their palace .
If I be to tell you all the adventure of the Argonauts , it would take me till nightfall , and perhaps a great deal longer .
There be no lack of wonderful event , a you may judge from what you have already hear .
At a certain island , they be hospitably receive by King Cyzicus , it sovereign , who make a feast for them , and treat them like brother .
But the Argonauts saw that this good king look downcast and very much troubled , and they therefore inquire of him what be the matter .
King Cyzicus hereupon inform them that he and his subject be greatly abuse and incommode by the inhabitant of a neighboring mountain , who make war upon them , and kill many people , and ravage the country .
And while they be talk about it , Cyzicus point to the mountain , and ask Jason and his companion what they saw there .
`` I see some very tall object , '' answer Jason ; `` but they be at such a distance that I can not distinctly make out what they be .
To tell your majesty the truth , they look so very strangely that I be inclined to think them cloud , which have chance to take something like human shape . ''
`` I see them very plainly , '' remark Lynceus , whose eye , you know , be as far-sighted a a telescope .
`` They be a band of enormous giant , all of whom have six arm apiece , and a club , a sword , or some other weapon in each of their hand . ''
`` You have excellent eye , '' say King Cyzicus .
`` Yes ; they be six-armed giant , a you say , and these be the enemy whom I and my subject have to contend with . ''
The next day , when the Argonauts be about set sail , down come these terrible giant , step a hundred yard at a stride , brandish their six arm apiece , and look formidable , so far aloft in the air .
Each of these monster be able to carry on a whole war by himself , for with one arm he could fling immense stone , and wield a club with another , and a sword with a third , while the fourth be poke a long spear at the enemy , and the fifth and sixth be shoot him with a bow and arrow .
But , luckily , though the giant be so huge , and have so many arm , they have each but one heart , and that no big nor brave than the heart of an ordinary man .
Besides , if they have be like the hundred-armed Briareus , the brave Argonauts would have give them their hand full of fight .
Jason and his friend go boldly to meet them , slew a great many , and make the rest take to their heel , so that if the giant have have six legs apiece instead of six arm , it would have serve them good to run away with .
Another strange adventure happen when the voyager come to Thrace , where they find a poor blind king , name Phineus , desert by his subject , and living in a very sorrowful way , all by himself : On Jason 's inquire whether they could do him any service , the king answer that he be terribly torment by three great wing creature , call Harpies , which have the face of woman , and the wing , body , and claw of vulture .
These ugly wretch be in the habit of snatch away his dinner , and allow him no peace of his life .
Upon hear this , the Argonauts spread a plentiful feast on the sea-shore , well know , from what the blind king say of their greediness , that the Harpies would snuff up the scent of the victual , and quickly come to steal them away .
And so it turn out ; for , hardly be the table set , before the three hideous vulture woman come flap their wing , seize the food in their talon , and fly off as fast a they could .
But the two son of the North Wind draw their sword , spread their pinion , and set off through the air in pursuit of the thief , whom they at last overtook among some island , after a chase of hundred of mile .
The two wing youth bluster terribly at the Harpies -LRB- for they have the rough temper of their father -RRB- , and so frighten them with their drawn sword , that they solemnly promise never to trouble King Phineus again .
Then the Argonauts sail onward and meet with many other marvelous incident , any one of which would make a story by itself .
At one time they land on an island , and be repose on the grass , when they suddenly find themselves assail by what seem a shower of steel-headed arrow .
Some of them stick in the ground , while others hit against their shield , and several penetrate their flesh .
The fifty hero start up , and look about them for the hidden enemy , but could find none , nor see any spot , on the whole island , where even a single archer could lie conceal .
Still , however , the steel-headed arrow come whiz among them ; and , at last , happen to look upward , they behold a large flock of bird , hover and wheel aloft , and shoot their feather down upon the Argonauts .
These feather be the steel-headed arrow that have so torment them .
There be no possibility of make any resistance ; and the fifty heroic Argonauts might all have be kill or wound by a flock of troublesome bird , without ever set eye on the Golden Fleece , if Jason have not think of ask the advice of the oaken image .
So he run to the galley as fast a his leg would carry him .
`` O , daughter of the Speaking Oak , '' cry he , all out of breath , `` we need your wisdom more than ever before !
We be in great peril from a flock of bird , who be shoot u with their steel-pointed feather .
What can we do to drive them away ? ''
`` Make a clatter on your shield , '' say the image .
On receive this excellent counsel , Jason hurry back to his companion -LRB- who be far more dismayed than when they fight with the six-armed giant -RRB- , and bid them strike with their sword upon their brazen shield .
Forthwith the fifty hero set heartily to work , bang with might and main , and raise such a terrible clatter , that the bird make what haste they could to get away ; and though they have shoot half the feather out of their wing , they be soon see skim among the cloud , a long distance off , and look like a flock of wild goose .
Orpheus celebrate this victory by play a triumphant anthem on his harp , and sing so melodiously that Jason beg him to desist , l , a the steel-feathered bird have be drive away by an ugly sound , they might be entice back again by a sweet one .
While the Argonauts remain on this island , they saw a small vessel approach the shore , in which be two young men of princely demeanor , and exceedingly handsome , a young prince generally be , in those day .
Now , who do you imagine these two voyager turn out to be ?
Why , if you will believe me , they be the son of that very Phrixus , who , in his childhood , have be carry to Colchis on the back of the golden-fleeced ram .
Since that time , Phrixus have marry the king 's daughter ; and the two young prince have be bear and bring up at Colchis , and have spend their play-days in the outskirt of the grove , in the center of which the Golden Fleece be hang upon a tree .
They be now on their way to Greece , in hope of get back a kingdom that have be wrongfully take from their father .
When the prince understand whither the Argonauts be go , they offer to turn back , and guide them to Colchis .
At the same time , however , they speak a if it be very doubtful whether Jason would succeed in get the Golden Fleece .
According to their account , the tree on which it hang be guard by a terrible dragon , who never fail to devour , at one mouthful , every person who might venture within his reach .
`` There be other difficulty in the way , '' continue the young prince .
`` But be not this enough ?
Ah , brave Jason , turn back before it be too late .
It would grieve u to the heart , if you and your nine and forty brave companion should be eat up , at fifty mouthful , by this execrable dragon . ''
`` My young friend , '' quietly reply Jason , `` I do not wonder that you think the dragon very terrible .
You have grow up from infancy in the fear of this monster , and therefore still regard him with the awe that child feel for the bugbear and hobgoblin which their nurse have talk to them about .
But , in my view of the matter , the dragon be merely a pretty large serpent , who be not half so likely to snap me up at one mouthful a I be to cut off his ugly head , and strip the skin from his body .
At all event , turn back who may , I will never see Greece again , unless I carry with me the Golden Fleece . ''
`` We will none of u turn back ! ''
cry his nine and forty brave comrade .
`` Let u get on board the galley this instant ; and if the dragon be to make a breakfast of u , much good may it do him . ''
And Orpheus -LRB- whose custom it be to set everything to music -RRB- begin to harp and sing most gloriously , and make every mother 's son of them feel a if nothing in this world be so delectable a to fight dragon , and nothing so truly honorable a to be eat up at one mouthful , in case of the bad .
After this -LRB- be now under the guidance of the two prince , who be well acquaint with the way -RRB- , they quickly sail to Colchis .
When the king of the country , whose name be Aetes , heard of their arrival , he instantly summon Jason to court .
The king be a stern and cruel look potentate ; and though he put on a polite and hospitable an expression a he could , Jason do not like his face a whit well than that of the wicked King Pelias , who dethrone his father .
`` You be welcome , brave Jason , '' say King Aetes .
`` Pray , be you on a pleasure voyage ?
-- Or do you meditate the discovery of unknown island ?
-- or what other cause have procure me the happiness of see you at my court ? ''
`` Great sir , '' reply Jason , with an obeisance -- for Chiron have teach him how to behave with propriety , whether to king or beggar -- `` I have come hither with a purpose which I now beg your majesty 's permission to execute .
King Pelias , who sit on my father 's throne -LRB- to which he have no more right than to the one on which your excellent majesty be now seat -RRB- , have engage to come down from it , and to give me his crown and sceptre , provide I bring him the Golden Fleece .
This , a your majesty be aware , be now hang on a tree here at Colchis ; and I humbly solicit your gracious leave to take it away . ''
In spite of himself , the king 's face twist itself into an angry frown ; for , above all thing else in the world , he prize the Golden Fleece , and be even suspect of have do a very wicked act , in order to get it into his own possession .
It put him into the bad possible humor , therefore , to hear that the gallant Prince Jason , and forty-nine of the brave young warrior of Greece , have come to Colchis with the sole purpose of take away his chief treasure .
`` Do you know , '' ask King Aetes , eye Jason very sternly , `` what be the condition which you must fulfill before get possession of the Golden Fleece ? ''
`` I have hear , '' rejoin the youth , `` that a dragon lie beneath the tree on which the prize hang , and that whoever approach him run the risk of be devour at a mouthful . ''
`` True , '' say the king , with a smile that do not look particularly good-natured .
`` Very true , young man .
But there be other thing a hard , or perhaps a little harder , to be do before you can even have the privilege of be devour by the dragon .
For example , you must first tame my two brazen-footed and brazen-lunged bull , which Vulcan , the wonderful blacksmith , make for me .
There be a furnace in each of their stomach ; and they breathe such hot fire out of their mouth and nostril , that nobody have hitherto go nigh them without be instantly burn to a small , black cinder .
What do you think of this , my brave Jason ? ''
`` I must encounter the peril , '' answer Jason , composedly , `` since it stand in the way of my purpose . ''
`` After tame the fiery bull , '' continue King Aetes , who be determine to scare Jason if possible , `` you must yoke them to a plow , and must plow the sacred earth in the Grove of Mars , and sow some of the same dragon 's teeth from which Cadmus raise a crop of arm men .
They be an unruly set of reprobate , those son of the dragon 's teeth ; and unless you treat them suitably , they will fall upon you sword in hand .
You and your nine and forty Argonauts , my bold Jason , be hardly numerous or strong enough to fight with such a host a will spring up . ''
`` My master Chiron , '' reply Jason , `` teach me , long ago , the story of Cadmus .
Perhaps I can manage the quarrelsome son of the dragon 's teeth as well a Cadmus do . ''
`` I wish the dragon have him , '' mutter King Aetes to himself , `` and the four-footed pedant , his schoolmaster , into the bargain .
Why , what a foolhardy , self-conceited coxcomb he be !
We 'll see what my fire-breathing bull will do for him .
Well , Prince Jason , '' he continue , aloud , and as complaisantly a he could , `` make yourself comfortable for to-day , and to-morrow morning , since you insist upon it , you shall try your skill at the plow . ''
While the king talk with Jason , a beautiful young woman be stand behind the throne .
She fix her eye earnestly upon the youthful stranger , and listen attentively to every word that be speak ; and when Jason withdraw from the king 's presence , this young woman follow him out of the room .
`` I be the king 's daughter , '' she say to him , `` and my name be Medea .
I know a great deal of which other young princess be ignorant , and can do many thing which they would be afraid so much a to dream of .
If you will trust to me , I can instruct you how to tame the fiery bull , and sow the dragon 's teeth , and get the Golden Fleece . ''
`` Indeed , beautiful princess , '' answer Jason , `` if you will do me this service , I promise to be grateful to you my whole life long . '' '
Gazing at Medea , he behold a wonderful intelligence in her face .
She be one of those person whose eye be full of mystery ; so that , while look into them , you seem to see a very great way , a into a deep well , yet can never be certain whether you see into the farthest depth , or whether there be not something else hide at the bottom .
If Jason have be capable of fear anything , he would have be afraid of make this young princess his enemy ; for , beautiful a she now look , she might , the very next instant , become as terrible a the dragon that keep watch over the Golden Fleece .
`` Princess , '' he exclaim , `` you seem indeed very wise and very powerful .
But how can you help me to do the thing of which you speak ?
Are you an enchantress ? ''
`` Yes , Prince Jason , '' answer Medea , with a smile , `` you have hit upon the truth .
