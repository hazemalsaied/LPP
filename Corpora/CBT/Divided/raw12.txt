A single glance was sufficient to show the prince that it was indeed Desiree ; and how another had come to the palace bearing her name , at that instant he neither knew nor cared .
Stealing on tip-toe from the room , he knocked at the next door , which was opened by Eglantine , who thought it was the old woman bearing their supper .
She started back at the sight of the prince , whom this time she also recognised .
But he thrust her aside , and flung himself at the feet of Desiree , to whom he poured out all his heart !
Dawn found them still conversing ; and the sun was high in the heavens before the princess perceived that she retained her human form .
Ah !
how happy she was when she knew that the days of her punishment were over ; and with a glad voice she told the prince the tale of her enchantment .
So the story ended well after all ; and the fairy Tulip , who turned out to be the old woman of the hut , made the young couple such a wedding feast as had never been seen since the world began .
And everybody was delighted , except Cerisette and her mother , who were put in a boat and carried to a small island , where they had to work hard for their living .
The Girl-Fish -LSB- Contes des Fees , par Madame d'Aulnoy . -RSB-
Once upon a time there lived , on the bank of a stream , a man and a woman who had a daughter .
As she was an only child , and very pretty besides , they never could make up their minds to punish her for her faults or to teach her nice manners ; and as for work -- she laughed in her mother 's face if she asked her to help cook the dinner or to wash the plates .
All the girl would do was to spend her days in dancing and playing with her friends ; and for any use she was to her parents they might as well have no daughter at all .
However , one morning her mother looked so tired that even the selfish girl could not help seeing it , and asked if there was anything she was able to do , so that her mother might rest a little .
The good woman looked so surprised and grateful for this offer that the girl felt rather ashamed , and at that moment would have scrubbed down the house if she had been requested ; but her mother only begged her to take the fishing-net out to the bank of the river and mend some holes in it , as her father intended to go fishing that night .
The girl took the net and worked so hard that soon there was not a hole to be found .
She felt quite pleased with herself , though she had had plenty to amuse her , as everybody who passed by had stopped and had a chat with her .
But by this time the sun was high overhead , and she was just folding her net to carry it home again , when she heard a splash behind her , and looking round she saw a big fish jump into the air .
Seizing the net with both hands , she flung it into the water where the circles were spreading one behind the other , and , more by luck than skill , drew out the fish .
` Well , you are a beauty ! '
she cried to herself ; but the fish looked up to her and said : ` You had better not kill me , for , if you do , I will turn you into a fish yourself ! '
The girl laughed contemptuously , and ran straight in to her mother .
` Look what I have caught , ' she said gaily ; ` but it is almost a pity to eat it , for it can talk , and it declares that , if I kill it , it will turn me into a fish too . '
` Oh , put it back , put it back ! '
implored the mother .
` Perhaps it is skilled in magic .
And I should die , and so would your father , if anything should happen to you . '
` Oh , nonsense , mother ; what power could a creature like that have over me ?
Besides , I am hungry , and if I do n't have my dinner soon , I shall be cross . '
And off she went to gather some flowers to stick in her hair .
About an hour later the blowing of a horn told her that dinner was ready .
` Did n't I say that fish would be delicious ? '
she cried ; and plunging her spoon into the dish the girl helped herself to a large piece .
But the instant it touched her mouth a cold shiver ran through her .
Her head seemed to flatten , and her eyes to look oddly round the corners ; her legs and her arms were stuck to her sides , and she gasped wildly for breath .
With a mighty bound she sprang through the window and fell into the river , where she soon felt better , and was able to swim to the sea , which was close by .
No sooner had she arrived there than the sight of her sad face attracted the notice of some of the other fishes , and they pressed round her , begging her to tell them her story . '
I am not a fish at all , ' said the new-comer , swallowing a great deal of salt water as she spoke ; for you can not learn how to be a proper fish all in a moment . '
I am not a fish at all , but a girl ; at least I was a girl a few minutes ago , only -- ' And she ducked her head under the waves so that they should not see her crying .
` Only you did not believe that the fish you caught had power to carry out its threat , ' said an old tunny .
` Well , never mind , that has happened to all of us , and it really is not a bad life .
Cheer up and come with us and see our queen , who lives in a palace that is much more beautiful than any your queens can boast of . '
The new fish felt a little afraid of taking such a journey ; but as she was still more afraid of being left alone , she waved her tail in token of consent , and off they all set , hundreds of them together .
The people on the rocks and in the ships that saw them pass said to each other : ` Look what a splendid shoal ! '
and had no idea that they were hastening to the queen 's palace ; but , then , dwellers on land have so little notion of what goes on in the bottom of the sea !
Certainly the little new fish had none .
She had watched jelly-fish and nautilus swimming a little way below the surface , and beautiful coloured sea-weeds floating about ; but that was all .
Now , when she plunged deeper her eyes fell upon strange things .
Wedges of gold , great anchors , heaps of pearl , inestimable stones , unvalued jewels -- all scattered in the bottom of the sea !
Dead men 's bones were there also , and long white creatures who had never seen the light , for they mostly dwelt in the clefts of rocks where the sun 's rays could not come .
At first our little fish felt as if she were blind also , but by-and-by she began to make out one object after another in the green dimness , and by the time she had swum for a few hours all became clear .
` Here we are at last , ' cried a big fish , going down into a deep valley , for the sea has its mountains and valleys just as much as the land .
` That is the palace of the queen of the fishes , and I think you must confess that the emperor himself has nothing so fine . '
` It is beautiful indeed , ' gasped the little fish , who was very tired with trying to swim as fast as the rest , and beautiful beyond words the palace was .
The walls were made of pale pink coral , worn smooth by the waters , and round the windows were rows of pearls ; the great doors were standing open , and the whole troop floated into the chamber of audience , where the queen , who was half a woman after all , was seated on a throne made of a green and blue shell .
` Who are you , and where do you come from ? '
said she to the little fish , whom the others had pushed in front .
And in a low , trembling voice , the visitor told her story . '
I was once a girl too , ' answered the queen , when the fish had ended ; ` and my father was the king of a great country .
A husband was found for me , and on my wedding-day my mother placed her crown on my head and told me that as long as I wore it I should likewise be queen .
For many months I was as happy as a girl could be , especially when I had a little son to play with .
But , one morning , when I was walking in my gardens , there came a giant and snatched the crown from my head .
Holding me fast , he told me that he intended to give the crown to his daughter , and to enchant my husband the prince , so that he should not know the difference between us .
Since then she has filled my place and been queen in my stead .
As for me , I was so miserable that I threw myself into the sea , and my ladies , who loved me , declared that they would die too ; but , instead of dying , some wizard , who pitied my fate , turned us all into fishes , though he allowed me to keep the face and body of a woman .
And fished we must remain till someone brings me back my crown again ! ' '
I will bring it back if you tell me what to do ! '
cried the little fish , who would have promised anything that was likely to carry her up to earth again .
And the queen answered : ` Yes , I will tell you what to do . '
She sat silent for a moment , and then went on : ` There is no danger if you will only follow my counsel ; and first you must return to earth , and go up to the top of a high mountain , where the giant has built his castle .
You will find him sitting on the steps weeping for his daughter , who has just died while the prince was away hunting .
At the last she sent her father my crown by a faithful servant .
But I warn you to be careful , for if he sees you he may kill you .
Therefore I will give you the power to change yourself into any creature that may help you best .
You have only to strike your forehead , and call out its name . '
This time the journey to land seemed much shorter than before , and when once the fish reached the shore she struck her forehead sharply with her tail , and cried : ` Deer , come to me ! '
In a moment the small , slimy body disappeared , and in its place stood a beautiful beast with branching horns and slender legs , quivering with longing to be gone .
Throwing back her head and snuffing the air , she broke into a run , leaping easily over the rivers and walls that stood in her way .
It happened that the king 's son had been hunting since daybreak , but had killed nothing , and when the deer crossed his path as he was resting under a tree he determined to have her .
He flung himself on his horse , which went like the wind , and as the prince had often hunted the forest before , and knew all the short cuts , he at last came up with the panting beast .
` By your favour let me go , and do not kill me , ' said the deer , turning to the prince with tears in her eyes , ` for I have far to run and much to do . '
And as the prince , struck dumb with surprise , only looked at her , the deer cleared the next wall and was soon out of sight .
` That ca n't really be a deer , ' thought the prince to himself , reining in his horse and not attempting to follow her .
` No deer ever had eyes like that .
It must be an enchanted maiden , and I will marry her and no other . '
So , turning his horse 's head , he rode slowly back to his palace .
The deer reached the giant 's castle quite out of breath , and her heart sank as she gazed at the tall , smooth walls which surrounded it .
Then she plucked up courage and cried : ` Ant , come to me ! '
And in a moment the branching horns and beautiful shape had vanished , and a tiny brown ant , invisible to all who did not look closely , was climbing up the walls .
It was wonderful how fast she went , that little creature !
The wall must have appeared miles high in comparison with her own body ; yet , in less time than would have seemed possible , she was over the top and down in the courtyard on the other side .
Here she paused to consider what had best be done next , and looking about her she saw that one of the walls had a tall tree growing by it , and in the corner was a window very nearly on a level with the highest branches of the tree .
` Monkey , come to me ! '
cried the ant ; and before you could turn round a monkey was swinging herself from the topmost branches into the room where the giant lay snoring .
` Perhaps he will be so frightened at the sight of me that he may die of fear , and I shall never get the crown , ' thought the monkey . '
I had better become something else . '
And she called softly : ` Parrot , come to me ! '
Then a pink and grey parrot hopped up to the giant , who by this time was stretching himself and giving yawns which shook the castle .
The parrot waited a little , until he was really awake , and then she said boldly that she had been sent to take away the crown , which was not his any longer , now his daughter the queen was dead .
On hearing these words the giant leapt out of bed with an angry roar , and sprang at the parrot in order to wring her neck with his great hands .
But the bird was too quick for him , and , flying behind his back , begged the giant to have patience , as her death would be of no use to him .
` That is true , ' answered the giant ; ` but I am not so foolish as to give you that crown for nothing .
Let me think what I will have in exchange ! '
And he scratched his huge head for several minutes , for giants ' minds always move slowly .
` Ah , yes , that will do ! '
exclaimed the giant at last , his face brightening .
` You shall have the crown if you will bring me a collar of blue stones from the Arch of St. Martin , in the Great City . '
Now when the parrot had been a girl she had often heard of this wonderful arch and the precious stones and marbles that had been let into it .
It sounded as if it would be a very hard thing to get them away from the building of which they formed a part , but all had gone well with her so far , and at any rate she could but try .
So she bowed to the giant , and made her way back to the window where the giant could not see her .
Then she called quickly : ` Eagle , come to me ! '
Before she had even reached the tree she felt herself borne up on strong wings ready to carry her to the clouds if she wished to go there , and seeming a mere speck in the sky , she was swept along till she beheld the Arch of St. Martin far below , with the rays of the sun shining on it .
Then she swooped down , and , hiding herself behind a buttress so that she could not be detected from below , she set herself to dig out the nearest blue stones with her beak .
It was even harder work than she had expected ; but at last it was done , and hope arose in her heart .
She next drew out a piece of string that she had found hanging from a tree , and sitting down to rest strung the stones together .
When the necklace was finished she hung it round her neck , and called : ` Parrot , come to me ! '
And a little later the pink and grey parrot stood before the giant .
` Here is the necklace you asked for , ' said the parrot .
And the eyes of the giant glistened as he took the heap of blue stones in his hand .
But for all that he was not minded to give up the crown .
` They are hardly as blue as I expected , ' he grumbled , though the parrot knew as well as he did that he was not speaking the truth ; ` so you must bring me something else in exchange for the crown you covet so much .
If you fail it will cost you not only the crown but you life also . '
` What is it you want now ? '
asked the parrot ; and the giant answered : ` If I give you my crown I must have another still more beautiful ; and this time you shall bring me a crown of stars . '
The parrot turned away , and as soon as she was outside she murmured : ` Toad , come to me ! '
And sure enough a toad she was , and off she set in search of the starry crown .
She had not gone far before she came to a clear pool , in which the stars were reflected so brightly that they looked quite real to touch and handle .
Stooping down she filled a bag she was carrying with the shining water and , returning to the castle , wove a crown out of the reflected stars .
Then she cried as before : ` Parrot , come to me ! '
And in the shape of a parrot she entered the presence of the giant .
` Here is the crown you asked for , ' she said ; and this time the giant could not help crying out with admiration .
He knew he was beaten , and still holding the chaplet of stars , he turned to the girl .
` Your power is greater than mine : take the crown ; you have won it fairly ! '
The parrot did not need to be told twice .
Seizing the crown , she sprang on to the window , crying : ` Monkey , come to me ! '
And to a monkey , the climb down the tree into the courtyard did not take half a minute .
When she had reached the ground she said again : ` Ant , come to me ! '
And a little ant at once began to crawl over the high wall .
How glad the ant was to be out of the giant 's castle , holding fast the crown which had shrunk into almost nothing , as she herself had done , but grew quite big again when the ant exclaimed : ` Deer , come to me ! '
Surely no deer ever ran so swiftly as that one !
On and on she went , bounding over rivers and crashing through tangles till she reached the sea .
Here she cried for the last time : ` Fish , come to me ! '
And , plunging in , she swam along the bottom as far as the palace , where the queen and all the fishes gathered together awaiting her .
The hours since she had left had gone very slowly -- as they always do to people that are waiting -- and many of them had quite given up hope . '
I am tired of staying here , ' grumbled a beautiful little creature , whose colours changed with every movement of her body , ' I want to see what is going on in the upper world .
It must be months since that fish went away . '
` It was a very difficult task , and the giant must certainly have killed her or she would have been back long ago , ' remarked another .
` The young flies will be coming out now , ' murmured a third , ` and they will all be eaten up by the river fish !
It is really too bad ! '
When , suddenly , a voice was heard from behind : ` Look !
look !
what is that bright thing that is moving so swiftly towards us ? '
And the queen started up , and stood on her tail , so excited was she .
A silence fell on all the crowd , and even the grumblers held their peace and gazed like the rest .
On and on came the fish , holding the crown tightly in her mouth , and the others moved back to let her pass .
On she went right up to the queen , who bent and , taking the crown , placed it on her own head .
Then a wonderful thing happened .
Her tail dropped away or , rather , it divided and grew into two legs and a pair of the prettiest feet in the world , while her maidens , who were grouped around her , shed their scales and became girls again .
They all turned and looked at each other first , and next at the little fish who had regained her own shape and was more beautiful than any of them .
` It is you who have given us back our life ; you , you ! '
they cried ; and fell to weeping from very joy .
So they all went back to earth and the queen 's palace , and quite forgot the one that lay under the sea .
But they had been so long away that they found many changes .
The prince , the queen 's husband , had died some years since , and in his place was her son , who had grown up and was king !
Even in his joy at seeing his mother again an air of sadness clung to him , and at last the queen could bear it no longer , and begged him to walk with her in the garden .
Seated together in a bower of jessamine -- where she had passed long hours as a bride -- she took her son 's hand and entreated him to tell her the cause of his sorrow .
` For , ' said she , ` if I can give you happiness you shall have it . '
` It is no use , ' answered the prince ; ` nobody can help me .
I must bear it alone . '
` But at least let me share your grief , ' urged the queen .
` No one can do that , ' said he . '
I have fallen in love with what I can never marry , and I must get on as best I can . '
` It may not be as impossible as you think , ' answered the queen .
` At any rate , tell me . '
There was silence between them for a moment , then , turning away his head , the prince answered gently : ' I have fallen in love with a beautiful deer ! '
` Ah , if that is all , ' exclaimed the queen joyfully .
And she told him in broken words that , as he had guessed , it was no deer but an enchanted maiden who had won back the crown and brought her home to her own people .
` She is here , in my palace , ' added the queen . '
I will take you to her . '
But when the prince stood before the girl , who was so much more beautiful than anything he had ever dreamed of , he lost all his courage , and stood with bent head before her .
Then the maiden drew near , and her eyes , as she looked at him , were the eyes of the deer that day in the forest .
She whispered softly : ` By your favour let me go , and do not kill me . '
And the prince remembered her words , and his heart was filled with happiness .
And the queen , his mother , watched them and smiled .
The Owl and the Eagle -LSB- From Cuentos Populars Catalans , por lo Dr. D. Francisco de S. Maspons y Labros . -RSB-
Once upon a time , in a savage country where the snow lies deep for many months in the year , there lived an owl and an eagle .
Though they were so different in many ways they became great friends , and at length set up house together , one passing the day in hunting and the other the night .
In this manner they did not see very much of each other -- and perhaps agreed all the better for that ; but at any rate they were perfectly happy , and only wanted one thing , or , rather , two things , and that was a wife for each . '
I really am too tired when I come home in the evening to clean up the house , ' said the eagle .
` And I am much too sleepy at dawn after a long night 's hunting to begin to sweep and dust , ' answered the owl .
And they both made up their minds that wives they must have .
They flew about in their spare moments to the young ladies of their acquaintance , but the girls all declared they preferred one husband to two .
The poor birds began to despair , when , one evening , after they had been for a wonder hunting together , they found two sisters fast asleep on their two beds .
The eagle looked at the owl and the owl looked at the eagle .
` They will make capital wives if they will only stay with us , ' said they .
And they flew off to give themselves a wash , and to make themselves smart before the girls awoke .
For many hours the sisters slept on , for they had come a long way , from a town where there was scarcely anything to eat , and felt weak and tired .
But by-and-by they opened their eyes and saw the two birds watching them . '
I hope you are rested ? '
asked the owl politely .
` Oh , yes , thank you , ' answered the girls .
` Only we are so very hungry .
Do you think we could have something to eat ? '
` Certainly ! '
replied the eagle .
And he flew away to a farmhouse a mile or two off , and brought back a nest of eggs in his strong beak ; while the owl , catching up a tin pot , went to a cottage where lived an old woman and her cow , and entering the shed by the window dipped the pot into the pail of new milk that stood there .
The girls were so much delighted with the kindness and cleverness of their hosts that , when the birds inquired if they would marry them and stay there for ever , they accepted without so much as giving it a second thought .
So the eagle took the younger sister to wife , and the owl the elder , and never was a home more peaceful than theirs !
All went well for several months , and then the eagle 's wife had a son , while , on the same day , the owl 's wife gave birth to a frog , which she placed directly on the banks of a stream near by , as he did not seem to like the house .
The children both grew quickly , and were never tired of playing together , or wanted any other companions .
One night in the spring , when the ice had melted , and the snow was gone , the sisters sat spinning in the house , awaiting their husbands ' return .
But long though they watched , neither the owl nor the eagle ever came ; neither that day nor the next , nor the next , nor the next .
At last the wives gave up all hope of their return ; but , being sensible women , they did not sit down and cry , but called their children , and set out , determined to seek the whole world over till the missing husbands were found .
Now the women had no idea in which direction the lost birds had gone , but they knew that some distance off was a thick forest , where good hunting was to be found .
It seemed a likely place to find them , or , at any rate , they might hear something of them , and they walked quickly on , cheered by the thought that they were doing something .
Suddenly the younger sister , who was a little in front , gave a cry of surprise .
` Oh !
look at that lake ! '
she said , ` we shall never get across it . '
` Yes we shall , ' answered the elder ; ' I know what to do . '
And taking a long piece of string from her pocket , fastened it into the frog 's mouth , like a bit .
` You must swim across the lake , ' she said , stooping to put him in , ` and we will walk across on the line behind you . '
And so they did , till they got to about the middle of the lake , when the frog boy stopped . '
I do n't like it , and I wo n't go any further , ' cried he sulkily .
And his mother had to promise him all sorts of nice things before he would go on again .
When at last they reached the other side , the owl 's wife untied the line from the frog 's mouth and told him he might rest and play by the lake till they got back from the forest .
Then she and her sister and the boy walked on , with the great forest looming before them .
But they had by this time come far and were very tired , and felt glad enough to see some smoke curling up from a little hut in front of them .
` Let us go in and ask for some water , ' said the eagle 's wife ; and in they went .
The inside of the hut was so dark that at first they could see nothing at all ; but presently they heard a feeble croak from one corner .
But sisters turned to look , and there , tied by wings and feet , and their eyes sunken , were the husbands that they sought .
Quick as lightning the wives cut the deer-thongs which bound them ; but the poor birds were too weak from pain and starvation to do more than utter soft sounds of joy .
Hardly , however , were they set free , than a voice of thunder made the two sisters jump , while the little boy clung tightly round his mother 's neck .
` What are you doing in my house ? '
cried she .
And the wives answered boldly that now they had found their husbands they meant to save them from such a wicked witch .
` Well , I will give you your chance , ' answered the ogress , with a hideous grin ; ` we will see if you can slide down this mountain .
If you can reach the bottom of the cavern , you shall have your husbands back again . '
And as she spoke she pushed them before her out of the door to the edge of a precipice , which went straight down several hundreds of feet .
Unseen by the witch , the frog 's mother fastened one end of the magic line about her , and whispered to the little boy to hold fast the other .
She had scarcely done so when the witch turned round .
` You do n't seem to like your bargain , ' said she ; but the girl answered : ` Oh , yes , I am quite ready .
I was only waiting for you ! '
And sitting down she began her slide .
On , on , she went , down to such a depth that even the witch 's eyes could not follow her ; but she took for granted that the woman was dead , and told the sister to take her place .
At that instant , however , the head of the elder appeared above the rock , brought upwards by the magic line .
The witch gave a howl of disgust , and hid her face in her hands ; thus giving the younger sister time to fasten the cord to her waist before the ogress looked up .
` You ca n't expect such luck twice , ' she said ; and the girl sat down and slid over the edge .
But in a few minutes she too was back again , and the witch saw that she had failed , and feared lest her power was going .
Trembling with rage though she was , she dared not show it , and only laughed hideously . '
I sha 'n' t let my prisoners go as easily as all that ! '
she said .
` Make my hair grow as thick and as black as yours , or else your husbands shall never see daylight again . '
` That is quite simple , ' replied the elder sister ; ` only you must do as we did -- and perhaps you wo n't like the treatment . '
` If you can bear it , of course I can , ' answered the witch .
And so the girls told her they had first smeared their heads with pitch and then laid hot stones upon them .
` It is very painful , ' said they , ` but there is no other way that we know of .
And in order to make sure that all will go right , one of us will hold you down while the other pours on the pitch . '
And so they did ; and the elder sister let down her hair till it hung over the witch 's eyes , so that she might believe it was her own hair growing .
Then the other brought a huge stone , and , in short , there was an end of the witch .
The sisters were savages who had never seen a missionary .
So when the sisters saw that she was dead they went to the hut , and nursed their husbands till they grew strong .
Then they picked up the frog , and all went to make another home on the other side of the great lake .
The Frog and the Lion Fairy -LSB- From the Journal of the Anthropological Institute . -RSB-
Once upon a time there lived a king who was always at war with his neighbours , which was very strange , as he was a good and kind man , quite content with his own country , and not wanting to seize land belonging to other people .
Perhaps he may have tried too much to please everybody , and that often ends in pleasing nobody ; but , at any rate , he found himself , at the end of a hard struggle , defeated in battle , and obliged to fall back behind the walls of his capital city .
Once there , he began to make preparations for a long siege , and the first thing he did was to plan how best to send his wife to a place of security .
The queen , who loved her husband dearly , would gladly have remained with him to share his dangers , but he would not allow it .
So they parted , with many tears , and the queen set out with a strong guard to a fortified castle on the outskirts of a great forest , some two hundred miles distant .
She cried nearly all the way , and when she arrived she cried still more , for everything in the castle was dusty and old , and outside there was only a gravelled courtyard , and the king had forbidden her to go beyond the walls without at least two soldiers to take care of her .
Now the queen had only been married a few months , and in her own home she had been used to walk and ride all over the hills without any attendants at all ; so she felt very dull at her being shut up in this way .
However , she bore it for a long while because it was the king 's wish , but when time passed and there were no signs of the war drifting in the direction of the castle , she grew bolder , and sometimes strayed outside the walls , in the direction of the forest .
Then came a dreadful period , when news from the king ceased entirely .
` He must surely be ill or dead , ' thought the poor girl , who even now was only sixteen . '
I can bear it no longer , and if I do not get a letter from him soon I shall leave this horrible place and go back to see what is the matter .
Oh !
I do wish I had never come away ! '
So , without telling anyone what she intended to do , she ordered a little low carriage to be built , something like a sledge , only it was on two wheels -- just big enough to hold one person . '
I am tired of being always in the castle , ' she said to her attendants ; ` and I mean to hunt a little .
Quite close by , of course , ' she added , seeing the anxious look on their faces .
` And there is no reason that you should not hunt too . '
All the faces brightened at that , for , to tell the truth , they were nearly as dull as their mistress ; so the queen had her way , and two beautiful horses were brought from the stable to draw the little chariot .
At first the queen took care to keep near the rest of the hunt , but gradually she stayed away longer and longer , and at last , one morning , she took advantage of the appearance of a wild boar , after which her whole court instantly galloped , to turn into a path in the opposite direction .
Unluckily , it did not happen to lead towards the king 's palace , where she intended to go , but she was so afraid her flight would be noticed that she whipped up her horses till they ran away .
When she understood what was happening the poor young queen was terribly frightened , and , dropping the reins , clung to the side of the chariot .
The horses , thus left without any control , dashed blindly against a tree , and the queen was flung out on the ground , where she lay for some minutes unconscious .
A rustling sound near her at length caused her to open her eyes ; before her stood a huge woman , almost a giantess , without any clothes save a lion 's skin , which was thrown over her shoulders , while a dried snake 's skin was plaited into her hair .
In one hand she held a club on which she leaned , and in the other a quiver full of arrows .
At the sight of this strange figure the queen thought she must be dead , and gazing on an inhabitant of another world .
So she murmured softly to herself : ' I am not surprised that people are so loth to die when they know that they will see such horrible creatures . '
But , low as she spoke , the giantess caught the words , and began to laugh .
` Oh , do n't be afraid ; you are still alive , and perhaps , after all , you may be sorry for it .
I am the Lion Fairy , and you are going to spend the rest of your days with me in my palace , which is quite near this .
So come along . '
But the queen shrank back in horror .
` Oh , Madam Lion , take me back , I pray you , to my castle ; and fix what ransom you like , for my husband will pay it , whatever it is .
But the giantess shook her head . '
I am rich enough already , ' she answered , ` but I am often dull , and I think you may amuse me a little . '
And , so saying , she changed her shape into that of a lion , and throwing the queen across her back , she went down the ten thousand steps that led to her palace .
The lion had reached the centre of the earth before she stopped in front of a house , lighted with lamps , and built on the edge of a lake of quicksilver .
In this lake various huge monsters might be seen playing or fighting -- the queen did not know which -- and around flew rooks and ravens , uttering dismal croaks .
In the distance was a mountain down whose sides waters slowly coursed -- these were the tears of unhappy lovers -- and nearer the gate were trees without either fruit of flowers , while nettles and brambles covered the ground .
If the castle had been gloomy , what did the queen feel about this ?
For some days the queen was so much shaken by all she had gone through that she lay with her eyes closed , unable either to move or speak .
When she got better , the Lion Fairy told her that if she liked she could build herself a cabin , as she would have to spend her life in that place .
At these words the queen burst into tears , and implored her gaoler to put her to death rather than condemn her to such a life ; but the Lion Fairy only laughed , and counselled her to try to make herself pleasant , as many worse things might befall her .
` Is there no way in which I can touch your heart ? '
asked the poor girl in despair .
` Well , if you really wish to please me you will make me a pasty out of the stings of bees , and be sure it is good . '
` But I do n't see any bees , ' answered the queen , looking round .
` Oh , no , there are n't any , ' replied her tormentor ; ` but you will have to find them all the same . '
And , so saying , she went away .
` After all , what does it matter ? '
thought the queen to herself , ' I have only one life , and I can but lose it . '
And not caring what she did , she left the palace and seating herself under a yew tree , poured out all her grief .
` Oh , my dear husband , ' wept she , ` what will you think when you come to the castle to fetch me and find me gone ?
Rather a thousand times that you should fancy me dead than imagine that I had forgotten you !
Ah , how fortunate that the broken chariot should be lying in the wood , for then you may grieve for me as one devoured by wild beasts .
And if another should take my place in your heart -- Well , at least I shall never know it . '
She might have continued for long in this fashion had not the voice of a crow directly overhead attracted her attention .
Looking up to see what was the matter she beheld , in the dim light , a crow holding a fat frog in his claws , which he evidently intended for his supper .
The queen rose hastily from the seat , and striking the bird sharply on the claws with the fan which hung from her side , she forced him to drop the frog , which fell to the round more dead than alive .
The crow , furious at his disappointment , flew angrily away .
As soon as the frog had recovered her senses she hopped up to the queen , who was still sitting under the yew .
Standing on her hind legs , and bowing low before her , she said gently : ` Beautiful lady , by what mischance do you come here ?
You are the only creature that I have seen do a kind deed since a fatal curiosity lured me to this place . '
` What sort of a frog can you be that knows the language of mortals ? '
asked the queen in her turn .
` But if you do , tell me , I pray , if I alone am a captive , for hitherto I have beheld no one but the monsters of the lake . '
` Once upon a time they were men and women like yourself , ' answered the frog , ` but having power in their hands , they used it for their own pleasure .
Therefore fate has sent them here for a while to bear the punishment of their misdoings . '
` But you , friend frog , you are not one of these wicked people , I am sure ? '
asked the queen . '
I am half a fairy , ' replied the frog ; ` but , although I have certain magic gifts , I am not able to do all I wish .
And if the Lion Fairy were to know of my presence in her kingdom she would hasten to kill me . '
` But if you are a fairy , how was it that you were so nearly slain by the crow ? '
said the queen , wrinkling her forehead .
` Because the secret of my power lies in my little cap that is made of rose leaves ; but I had laid it aside for the moment , when that horrible crow pounced upon me .
Once it is on my head I fear nothing .
But let me repeat ; had it not been for you I could not have escaped death , and if I can do anything to help you , or soften your hard fate , you have only to tell me . '
` Alas , ' sighed the queen , ' I have been commanded by the Lion Fairy to make her a pasty out of the stings of bees , and , as far as I can discover , there are none here ; as how should there be , seeing there are no flowers for them to feed on ?
And , even if there were , how could I catch them ? '
` Leave it to me , ' said the frog , ' I will manage it for you . '
And , uttering a strange noise , she struck the ground thrice with her foot .
In an instant six thousand frogs appeared before her , one of them bearing a little cap .
` Cover yourselves with honey , and hop round by the beehives , ' commanded the frog , putting on the cap which her friend was holding in her mouth .
And turning to the queen , he added : ` The Lion Fairy keeps a store of bees in a secret place near to the bottom of the ten thousand steps leading into the upper world .
Not that she wants them for herself , but they are sometimes useful to her in punishing her victims .
However , this time we will get the better of her . '
Just as she had finished speaking the six thousand frogs returned , looking so strange with bees sticking to every part of them that , sad as she felt , the poor queen could not help laughing .
The bees were all so stupefied with what they had eaten that it was possible to draw their stings without hunting them .
So , with the help of her friend , the queen soon made ready her pasty and carried it to the Lion Fairy .
` Not enough pepper , ' said the giantess , gulping down large morsels , in order the hide the surprise she felt .
` Well , you have escaped this time , and I am glad to find I have got a companion a little more intelligent than the others I have tried .
Now , you had better go and build yourself a house . '
So the queen wandered away , and picking up a small axe which lay near the door she began with the help of her friend the frog to cut down some cypress trees for the purpose .
And not content with that the six thousand froggy servants were told to help also , and it was not long before they had built the prettiest little cabin in the world , and made a bed in one corner of dried ferns which they fetched from the top of the ten thousand steps .
It looked soft and comfortable , and the queen was very glad to lie down upon it , so tired was she with all that had happened since the morning .
Scarcely , however , had she fallen asleep when the lake monsters began to make the most horrible noises just outside , while a small dragon crept in and terrified her so that she ran away , which was just what the dragon wanted !
The poor queen crouched under a rock for the rest of the night , and the next morning , when she woke from her troubled dreams , she was cheered at seeing the frog watching by her . '
I hear we shall have to build you another palace , ' said she .
` Well , this time we wo n't go so near the lake . '
And she smiled with her funny wide mouth , till the queen took heart , and they went together to find wood for the new cabin .
The tiny palace was soon ready , and a fresh bed made of wild thyme , which smelt delicious .
Neither the queen nor the frog said anything about it , but somehow , as always happens , the story came to the ears of the Lion Fairy , and she sent a raven to fetch the culprit .
` What gods or men are protecting you ? '
she asked , with a frown .
` This earth , dried up by a constant rain of sulphur and fire , produces nothing , yet I hear that YOUR bed is made of sweet smelling herbs .
However , as you can get flowers for yourself , of course you can get them for me , and in an hour 's time I must have in my room a nosegay of the rarest flowers .
If not -- !
Now you can go . '
The poor queen returned to her house looking so sad that the frog , who was waiting for her , noticed it directly .
` What is the matter ? '
said she , smiling .
` Oh , how can you laugh ! '
replied the queen .
` This time I have to bring her in an hour a posy of the rarest flowers , and where am I to find them ?
If I fail I know she will kill me . '
` Well , I must see if I ca n't help you , ' answered the frog .
` The only person I have made friends with here is a bat .
She is a good creature , and always does what I tell her , so I will just lend her my cap , and if she puts it on , and flies into the world , she will bring back all we want .
I would go myself , only she will be quicker . '
Then the queen dried her eyes , and waited patiently , and long before the hour had gone by the bat flew in with all the most beautiful and sweetest flowers that grew on the earth .
The girl sprang up overjoyed at the sight , and hurried with them to the Lion Fairy , who was so astonished that for once she had nothing to say .
Now the smell and touch of the flowers had made the queen sick with longing for her home , and she told the frog that she would certainly die if she did not manage to escape somehow .
` Let me consult my cap , ' said the frog ; and taking it off she laid it in a box , and threw in after it a few sprigs of juniper , some capers , and two peas , which she carried under her right leg ; she then shut down the lid of the box , and murmured some words which the queen did not catch .
In a few moments a voice was heard speaking from the box .
` Fate , who rules us all , ' said the voice , ` forbids your leaving this place till the time shall come when certain things are fulfilled .
But , instead , a gift shall be given you , which will comfort you in all your troubles . '
And the voice spoke truly , for , a few days after , when the frog peeped in at the door she found the most beautiful baby in the world lying by the side of the queen .
` So the cap has kept its word , ' cried the frog with delight .
` How soft its cheeks are , and what tiny feet it has got !
What shall we call it ? '
This was a very important point , and needed much discussion .
A thousand names were proposed and rejected for a thousand silly reasons .
One was another reminded the queen of somebody she did not like ; but at length an idea flashed into the queen 's head , and she called out : ' I know !
We will call her Muffette . '
` That is the very thing , ' shouted the frog , jumping high into the air ; and so it was settled .
The princess Muffette was about six months old when the frog noticed that the queen had begun to grow sad again .
` Why do you have that look in your eyes ? '
she asked one day , when she had come in to play with the baby , who could now crawl .
The way they played their game was to let Muffette creep close to the frog , and then for the frog to bound high into the air and alight on the child 's head , or back , or legs , when she always sent up a shout of pleasure .
There is no play fellow like a frog ; but then it must be a fairy frog , or else you might hurt it , and if you did something dreadful might happen to you .
Well , as I have said , our frog was struck with the queen 's sad face , and lost no time in asking her what was the reason . '
I do n't see what you have to complain of now ; Muffette is quite well and quite happy , and even the Lion Fairy is kind to her when she sees her .
What is it ? '
` Oh !
if her father could only see her ! '
broke forth the queen , clasping her hands .
` Or if I could only tell him all that has happened since we parted .
But they will have brought him tidings of the broken carriage , and he will have thought me dead , or devoured by wild beasts .
And though he will mourn for me long -- I know that well -- yet in time they will persuade him to take a wife , and she will be young and fair , and he will forget me . '
And in all this the queen guessed truly , save that nine long years were to pass before he would consent to put another in her place .
The frog answered nothing at the time , but stopped her game and hopped away among the cypress trees .
Here she sat and thought and thought , and the next morning she went back to the queen and said : ' I have come , madam , to make you an offer .
Shall I go to the king instead of you , and tell him of your sufferings , and that he has the most charming baby in the world for his daughter ?
The way is long , and I travel slowly ; but , sooner or later , I shall be sure to arrive .
Only , are you not afraid to be left without my protection ?
Ponder the matter carefully ; it is for you to decide . '
` Oh , it needs no pondering , ' cried the queen joyfully , holding up her clasped hands , and making Muffette do likewise , in token of gratitude .
But in order that he may know that you have come from me I will send him a letter . '
And pricking her arm , she wrote a few words with her blood on the corner of her handkerchief .
Then tearing it off , she gave it to the frog , and they bade each other farewell .
It took the frog a year and four days to mount the ten thousand steps that led to the upper world , but that was because she was still under the spell of a wicked fairy .
By the time she reached the top , she was so tired that she had to remain for another year on the banks of a stream to rest , and also to arrange the procession with which she was to present herself before the king .
For she knew far too well what was due to herself and her relations , to appear at Court as if she was a mere nobody .
At length , after many consultations with her cap , the affair was settled , and at the end of the second year after her parting with the queen they all set out .
First walked her bodyguard of grasshoppers , followed by her maids of honour , who were those tiny green frogs you see in the fields , each one mounted on a snail , and seated on a velvet saddle .
Next came the water-rats , dressed as pages , and lastly the frog herself , in a litter borne by eight toads , and made of tortoiseshell .
Here she could lie at her ease , with her cap on her head , for it was quite large and roomy , and could easily have held two eggs when the frog was not in it .
The journey lasted seven years , and all this time the queen suffered tortures of hope , though Muffette did her best to comfort her .
Indeed , she would most likely have died had not the Lion Fairy taken a fancy that the child and her mother should go hunting with her in the upper world , and , in spite of her sorrows , it was always a joy to the queen to see the sun again .
As for little Muffette , by the time she was seven her arrows seldom missed their mark .
So , after all , the years of waiting passed more quickly than the queen had dared to hope .
The frog was always careful to maintain her dignity , and nothing would have persuaded her to show her face in public places , or even along the high road , where there was a chance of meeting anyone .
But sometimes , when the procession had to cross a little stream , or go over a piece of marshy ground , orders would be given for a halt ; fine clothes were thrown off , bridles were flung aside , and grasshoppers , water-rats , even the frog herself , spent a delightful hour or two playing in the mud .
But at length the end was in sight , and the hardships were forgotten in the vision of the towers of the king 's palace ; and , one bright morning , the cavalcade entered the gates with all the pomp and circumstance of a royal embassy .
And surely no ambassador had ever created such a sensation !
Door and windows , even the roofs of houses , were filled with people , whose cheers reached the ears of the king .
However , he had no time to attend to such matters just then , as , after nine years , he had at last consented to the entreaties of his courtiers , and was on the eve of celebrating his second marriage .
The frog 's heart beat high when her litter drew up before the steps of the palace , and leaning forward she beckoned to her side one of the guards who were standing in his doorway . '
I wish to see his Majesty , ' said he .
` His Majesty is engaged , and can see no one , ' answered the soldier .
` His Majesty will see ME , ' returned the frog , fixing her eye upon him ; and somehow the man found himself leading the procession along the gallery into the Hall of Audience , where the king sat surrounded by his nobles arranging the dresses which everyone was to wear at his marriage ceremony .
All stared in surprise as the procession advanced , and still more when the frog gave one bound from the litter on to the floor , and with another landed on the arm of the chair of state . '
I am only just in time , sire , ' began the frog ; ` had I been a day later you would have broken your faith which you swore to the queen nine years ago . '
` Her remembrance will always be dear to me , ' answered the king gently , though all present expected him to rebuke the frog severely for her impertinence .
But know , Lady Frog , that a king can seldom do as he wishes , but must be bound by the desires of his subjects .
For nine years I have resisted them ; now I can do so no longer , and have made choice of the fair young maiden playing at ball yonder . '
` You can not wed her , however fair she may be , for the queen your wife is still alive , and sends you this letter written in her own blood , ' said the frog , holding out the square of handkerchief as she spoke .
` And , what is more , you have a daughter who is nearly nine years old , and more beautiful than all the other children in the world put together . '
The king turned pale when he heard these words , and his hand trembled so that he could hardly read what the queen had written .
Then he kissed the handkerchief twice or thrice , and burst into tears , and it was some minutes before he could speak .
When at length he found his voice he told his councillors that the writing was indeed that of the queen , and now that he had the joy of knowing she was alive he could , of course , proceed no further with his second marriage .
This naturally displeased the ambassadors who had conducted the bride to court , and one of them inquired indignantly if he meant to put such an insult on the princess on the word of a mere frog . '
I am not a `` mere frog , '' and I will give you proof of it , ' retorted the angry little creature .
And putting on her cap , she cried : Fairies that are my friends , come hither ! '
And in a moment a crowd of beautiful creatures , each one with a crown on her head , stood before her .
Certainly none could have guessed that they were the snails , water-rats , and grasshoppers from which she had chosen her retinue .
At a sign from the frog the fairies danced a ballet , with which everyone was so delighted that they begged to have to repeated ; but now it was not youths and maidens who were dancing , but flowers .
Then these again melted into fountains , whose waters interlaced and , rushing down the sides of the hall , poured out in a cascade down the steps , and formed a river found the castle , with the most beautiful little boats upon it , all painted and gilded .
` Oh , let us go in them for a sail ! '
cried the princess , who had long ago left her game of ball for a sight of these marvels , and , as she was bent upon it , the ambassadors , who had been charged never to lose sight of her , were obliged to go also , though they never entered a boat if they could help it .
But the moment they and the princess had seated themselves on the soft cushions , river and boats vanished , and the princess and the ambassadors vanished too .
Instead the snails and grasshoppers and water-rats stood round the frog in their natural shapes .
` Perhaps , ' said she , ` your Majesty may now be convinced that I am a fairy and speak the truth .
Therefore lose no time in setting in order the affairs of your kingdom and go in search of your wife .
Here is a ring that will admit you into the presence of the queen , and will likewise allow you to address unharmed the Lion Fairy , though she is the most terrible creature that ever existed . '
By this time the king had forgotten all about the princess , whom he had only chosen to please his people , and was as eager to depart on his journey as the frog was for him to go .
He made one of his ministers regent of the kingdom , and gave the frog everything her heart could desire ; and with her ring on his finger he rode away to the outskirts of the forest .
Here he dismounted , and bidding his horse go home , he pushed forward on foot .
Having nothing to guide him as to where he was likely to find the entrance of the under-world , the king wandered hither and thither for a long while , till , one day , while he was resting under a tree , a voice spoke to him .
` Why do you give yourself so much trouble for nought , when you might know what you want to know for the asking ?
Alone you will never discover the path that leads to your wife . '
Much startled , the king looked about him .
He could see nothing , and somehow , when he thought about it , the voice seemed as if it were part of himself .
Suddenly his eyes fell on the ring , and he understood .
` Fool that I was ! '
cried he ; ` and how much precious time have I wasted ?
Dear ring , I beseech you , grant me a vision of my wife and my daughter ! '
And even as he spoke there flashed past him a huge lioness , followed by a lady and a beautiful young maid mounted on fairy horses .
Almost fainting with joy he gazed after them , and then sank back trembling on the ground .
` Oh , lead me to them , lead me to them ! '
he exclaimed .
And the ring , bidding him take courage , conducted him safely to the dismal place where his wife had lived for ten years .
Now the Lion Fairy knew beforehand of his expected presence in her dominions , and she ordered a palace of crystal to be built in the middle of the lake of quicksilver ; and in order to make it more difficult of approach she let it float whither it would .
Immediately after their return from the chase , where the king had seen them , she conveyed the queen and Muffette into the palace , and put them under the guard of the monsters of the lake , who one and all had fallen in love with the princess .
They were horribly jealous , and ready to eat each other up for her sake , so they readily accepted the charge .
Some stationed themselves round the floating palace , some sat by the door , while the smallest and lightest perched themselves on the roof .
Of course the king was quite ignorant of these arrangements , and boldly entered the palace of the Lion Fairy , who was waiting for him , with her tail lashing furiously , for she still kept her lion 's shape .
With a roar that shook the walls she flung herself upon him ; but he was on the watch , and a blow from his sword cut off the paw she had put forth to strike him dead .
She fell back , and with his helmet still on and his shield up , he set his foot on her throat .
` Give me back the wife and the child you have stolen from me , ' he said , ` or you shall not live another second ! '
But the fairy answered : ` Look through the window at that lake and see if it is in my power to give them to you . '
And the king looked , and through the crystal walls he beheld his wife and daughter floating on the quicksilver .
At that sight the Lion Fairy and all her wickedness was forgotten .
Flinging off his helmet , he shouted to them with all his might .
The queen knew his voice , and she and Muffette ran to the window and held out their hands .
Then the king swore a solemn oath that he would never leave the spot without taking them if it should cost him his life ; and he meant it , though at the moment he did not know what he was undertaking .
Three years passed by , and the king was no nearer to obtaining his heart 's desire .
He had suffered every hardship that could be imagined -- nettles had been his bed , wild fruits more bitter than gall his food , while his days had been spent in fighting the hideous monsters which kept him from the palace .
He had not advanced one single step , nor gained one solitary advantage .
Now he was almost in despair , and ready to defy everything and throw himself into the lake .
It was at this moment of his blackest misery that , one night , a dragon who had long watched him from the roof crept to his side .
` You thought that love would conquer all obstacles , ' said he ; ` well , you have found it has n't !
But if you will swear to me by your crown and sceptre that you will give me a dinner of the food that I never grow tired of , whenever I choose to ask for it , I will enable you to reach your wife and daughter . '
Ah , how glad the king was to hear that !
What oath would he not have taken so as to clasp his wife and child in is arms ?
Joyfully he swore whatever the dragon asked of him ; then he jumped on his back , and in another instant would have been carried by the strong wings into the castle if the nearest monsters had not happened to awake and hear the noise of talking and swum to the shore to give battle .
The fight was long and hard , and when the king at last beat back his foes another struggle awaited him .
At the entrance gigantic bats , owls , and crows set upon him from all sides ; but the dragon had teeth and claws , while the queen broke off sharp bits of glass and stabbed and cut in her anxiety to help her husband .
At length the horrible creatures flew away ; a sound like thunder was heard , the palace and the monsters vanished , while , at the same moment -- no one knew how -- the king found himself standing with his wife and daughter in the hall of his own home .
The dragon had disappeared with all the rest , and for some years no more was heard or thought of him .
Muffette grew every day more beautiful , and when she was fourteen the kings and emperors of the neighbouring countries sent to ask her in marriage for themselves or their sons .
For a long time the girl turned a deaf ear to all their prayers ; but at length a young prince of rare gifts touched her heart , and though the king had left her free to choose what husband she would , he had secretly hoped that out of all the wooers this one might be his son-in-law .
So they were betrothed that some day with great pomp , and then with many tears , the prince set out for his father 's court , bearing with him a portrait of Muffette .
The days passed slowly to Muffette , in spite of her brave efforts to occupy herself and not to sadden other people by her complaints .
One morning she was playing on her harp in the queen 's chamber when the king burst into the room and clasped his daughter in his arms with an energy that almost frightened her .
` Oh , my child !
my dear child !
why were you ever born ? '
cried he , as soon as he could speak .
` Is the prince dead ? '
faltered Muffette , growing white and cold .
` No , no ; but -- oh , how can I tell you ! '
And he sank down on a pile of cushions while his wife and daughter knelt beside him .
At length he was able to tell his tale , and a terrible one it was !
There had just arrived at court a huge giant , as ambassador from the dragon by whose help the king had rescued the queen and Muffette from the crystal palace .
The dragon had been very busy for many years past , and had quite forgotten the princess till the news of her betrothal reached his ears .
Then he remembered the bargain he had made with her father ; and the more he heard of Muffette the more he felt sure she would make a delicious dish .
So he had ordered the giant who was his servant to fetch her at once .
No words would paint the horror of both the queen and the princess as they listened to this dreadful doom .
They rushed instantly to the hall , where the giant was awaiting them , and flinging themselves at his feet implored him to take the kingdom if he would , but to have pity on the princess .
The giant looked at them kindly , for he was not at all hard-hearted , but said that he had no power to do anything , and that if the princess did not go with him quietly the dragon would come himself .
Several days went by , and the king and queen hardly ceased from entreating the aid of the giant , who by this time was getting weary of waiting .
` There is only one way of helping you , ' he said at last , ` and that is to marry the princess to my nephew , who , besides being young and handsome , has been trained in magic , and will know how to keep her safe from the dragon . '
` Oh , thank you , thank you ! '
cried the parents , clasping his great hands to their breasts .
` You have indeed lifted a load from us .
She shall have half the kingdom for her dowry . '
But Muffette stood up and thrust them aside . '
I will not buy my life with faithlessness , ' she said proudly ; ` and I will go with you this moment to the dragon 's abode . '
And all her father 's and mother 's tears and prayers availed nothing to move her .
The next morning Muffette was put into a litter , and , guarded by the giant and followed by the king and queen and the weeping maids of honour , they started for the foot of the mountain where the dragon had his castle .
The way , though rough and stony , seemed all too short , and when they reached the spot appointed by the dragon the giant ordered the men who bore the litter to stand still .
` It is time for you to bid farewell to your daughter , ' said he ; ` for I see the dragon coming to us . '
It was true ; a cloud appeared to pass over the sun , for between them and it they could all discern dimly a huge body half a mile long approaching nearer and nearer .
At first the king could not believe that this was the small beast who had seemed so friendly on the shore of the lake of quicksilver but then he knew very little of necromancy , and had never studied the art of expanding and contracting his body .
But it was the dragon and nothing else , whose six wings were carrying him forward as fast as might be , considering his great weight and the length of his tail , which had fifty twists and a half .
He came quickly , yes ; but the frog , mounted on a greyhound , and wearing her cap on her head , went quicker still .
Entering a room where the prince was sitting gazing at the portrait of his betrothed , she cried to him : ` What are you doing lingering here , when the life of the princess is nearing its last moment ?
In the courtyard you will find a green horse with three heads and twelve feet , and by its side a sword eighteen yards long .
Hasten , lest you should be too late ! '
The fight lasted all day , and the prince 's strength was well-nigh spent , when the dragon , thinking that the victory was won , opened his jaws to give a roar of triumph .
The prince saw his chance , and before his foe could shut his mouth again had plunged his sword far down his adversary 's throat .
There was a desperate clutching of the claws to the earth , a slow flagging of the great wings , then the monster rolled over on his side and moved no more .
Muffette was delivered .
After this they all went back to the palace .
The marriage took place the following day , and Muffette and her husband lived happy for ever after .
The Adventures of Covan the Brown-Haired -LSB- From Les Contes des Fees , par Madame d'Aulnoy . -RSB-
On the shores of the west , where the great hills stand with their feet in the sea , dwelt a goatherd and his wife , together with their three sons and one daughter .
All day long the young men fished and hunted , while their sister took out the kids to pasture on the mountain , or stayed at home helping her mother and mending the nets .
For several years they all lived happily together , when one day , as the girl was out on the hill with the kids , the sun grew dark and an air cold as a thick white mist came creeping , creeping up from the sea .
She rose with a shiver , and tried to call to her kids , but the voice died away in her throat , and strong arms seemed to hold her .
Loud were the wails in the hut by the sea when the hours passed on and the maiden came not .
Many times the father and brothers jumped up , thinking they heard her steps , but in the thick darkness they could scarcely see their own hands , nor could they tell where the river lay , nor where the mountain .
One by one the kids came home , and at every bleat someone hurried to open the door , but no sound broke the stillness .
Through the night no one slept , and when morning broke and the mist rolled back , they sought the maiden by sea and by land , but never a trace of her could be found anywhere .
Thus a year and a day slipped by , and at the end of it Gorla of the Flocks and his wife seemed suddenly to have grown old .
Their sons too were sadder than before , for they loved their sister well , and had never ceased to mourn for her .
At length Ardan the eldest spoke and said : ` It is now a year and a day since our sister was taken from us , and we have waited in grief and patience for her to return .
Surely some evil has befallen her , or she would have sent us a token to put our hearts at rest ; and I have vowed to myself that my eyes shall not know sleep till , living or dead , I have found her . '
` If you have vowed , then must you keep your vow , ' answered Gorla .
` But better had it been if you had first asked your father 's leave before you made it .
Yet , since it is so , your mother will bake you a cake for you to carry with you on your journey .
Who can tell how long it may be ? '
So the mother arose and baked not one cake but two , a big one and a little one .
` Choose , my son , ' said she .
` Will you have the little cake with your mother 's blessing , or the big one without it , in that you have set aside your father and taken on yourself to make a vow ? ' '
I will have the large cake , ' answered the youth ; ` for what good would my mother 's blessing do for me if I was dying of hunger ? '
And taking the big cake he went his way .
Straight on he strode , letting neither hill nor river hinder him .
Swiftly he walked -- swiftly as the wind that blew down the mountain .
The eagles and the gulls looked on from their nests as he passed , leaving the deer behind him ; but at length he stopped , for hunger had seized on him , and he could walk no more .
Trembling with fatigue he sat himself on a rock and broke a piece off his cake .
` Spare me a morsel , Ardan son of Gorla , ' asked a raven , fluttering down towards him .
` Seek food elsewhere , O bearer of ill-news , ' answered Ardan son of Gorla ; ` it is but little I have for myself . '
And he stretched himself out for a few moments , then rose to his feet again .
On and on went he till the little birds flew to their nests , and the brightness died out of the sky , and a darkness fell over the earth .
On and on , and on , till at last he saw a beam of light streaming from a house and hastened towards it .
The door was opened and he entered , but paused when he beheld an old man lying on a bench by the fire , while seated opposite him was a maiden combing out the locks of her golden hair with a comb of silver .
` Welcome , fair youth , ' said the old man , turning his head .
` Sit down and warm yourself , and tell me how fares the outer world .
It is long since I have seen it . '
` All my news is that I am seeking service , ' answered Ardan son of Gorla ; ' I have come from far since sunrise , and glad was I to see the rays of your lamp stream into the darkness . ' '
I need someone to herd my three dun cows , which are hornless , ' said the old man .
` If , for the space of a year , you can bring them back to me each evening before the sun sets , I will make you payment that will satisfy your soul . '
But here the girl looked up and answered quickly : ` Ill will come of it if he listens to your offer . '
` Counsel unsought is worth nothing , ' replied , rudely , Ardan son of Gorla .
` It would be little indeed that I am fit for if I can not drive three cows out to pasture and keep them safe from the wolves that may come down from the mountains .
Therefore , good father , I will take service with you at daybreak , and ask no payment till the new year dawns . '
Next morning the bell of the deer was not heard amongst the fern before the maiden with the hair of gold had milked the cows , and led them in front of the cottage where the old man and Ardan son of Gorla awaited them .
` Let them wander where they will , ' he said to his servant , ` and never seek to turn them from their way , for well they know the fields of good pasture .
But take heed to follow always behind them , and suffer nothing that you see , and nought that you hear , to draw you into leaving them .
Now go , and may wisdom go with you . '
As he ceased speaking he touched one of the cows on her forehead , and she stepped along the path , with the two others one on each side .
As he had been bidden , behind them came Ardan son of Gorla , rejoicing in his heart that work so easy had fallen to his lot .
At the year 's end , thought he , enough money would lie in his pocket to carry him into far countries where his sister might be , and , in the meanwhile , someone might come past who could give him tidings of her .
Thus he spoke to himself , when his eyes fell on a golden cock and a silver hen running swiftly along the grass in front of him .
In a moment the words that the old man had uttered vanished from his mind and he gave chase .
They were so near that he could almost seize their tails , yet each time he felt sure he could catch them his fingers closed on the empty air .
At length he could run no more , and stopped to breathe , while the cock and hen went on as before .
Then he remembered the cows , and , somewhat frightened , turned back to seek them .
Luckily they had not strayed far , and were quietly feeding on the thick green grass .
Ardan son of Gorla was sitting under a tree , when he beheld a staff of gold and a staff of silver doubling themselves in strange ways on the meadow in front of him , and starting up he hastened towards them .
He followed them till he was tired , but he could not catch them , though they seemed ever within his reach .
When at last he gave up the quest his knees trembled beneath him for very weariness , and glad was he to see a tree growing close by lade with fruits of different sorts , of which he ate greedily .
The sun was by now low in the heavens , and the cows left off feeding , and turned their faces home again , followed by Ardan son of Gorla .
At the door of their stable the maiden stood awaiting them , and saying nought to their herd , she sat down and began to milk .
But it was not milk that flowed into her pail ; instead it was filled with a thin stream of water , and as she rose up from the last cow the old man appeared outside .
` Faithless one , you have betrayed your trust ! '
he said to Ardan son of Gorla .
` Not even for one day could you keep true !
Well , you shall have your reward at once , that others may take warning from you . '
And waving his wand he touched with it the chest of the youth , who became a pillar of stone .
Now Gorla of the Flocks and his wife were full of grief that they had lost a son as well as a daughter , for no tidings had come to them of Ardan their eldest born .
At length , when two years and two days had passed since the maiden had led her kids to feed on the mountain and had been seen no more , Ruais , second son of Gorla , rose up one morning , and said : ` Time is long without my sister and Ardan my brother .
So I have vowed to seek them wherever they may be . '
And his father answered : ` Better it had been if you had first asked my consent and that of your mother ; but as you have vowed so must you do . '
Then he bade his wife make a cake , but instead she made two , and offered Ruais his choice , as she had done to Ardan .
Like Ardan , Ruais chose the large , unblessed cake , and set forth on his way , doing always , though he knew it not , that which Ardan had done ; so , needless is it to tell what befell him till he too stood , a pillar of stone , on the hill behind the cottage , so that all men might see the fate that awaited those who broke their faith .
Another year and a day passed by , when Covan the Brown-haired , youngest son of Gorla of the Flocks , one morning spake to his parents , saying : ` It is more than three years since my sister left us .
My brothers have also gone , no one know whither , and of us four none remains but I. No , therefore , I long to seek them , and I pray you and my mother to place no hindrance in my way . '
And his father answered : ` Go , then , and take our blessing with you . '
So the wife of Gorla of the Flocks baked two cakes , one large and one small ; and Covan took the small one , and started on his quest .
In the wood he felt hungry , for he had walked far , and he sat down to eat .
Suddenly a voice behind him cried : ' A bit for me !
a bit for me ! '
And looking round he beheld the black raven of the wilderness .
` Yes , you shall have a bit , ' said Covan the Brown-haired ; and breaking off a piece he stretched it upwards to the raven , who ate it greedily .
Then Covan arose and went forward , till he saw the light from the cottage streaming before him , and glad was he , for night was at hand .
` Maybe I shall find some work there , ' he thought , ` and at least I shall gain money to help me in my search ; for who knows how far my sister and my brothers may have wandered ? '
The door stood open and he entered , and the old man gave him welcome , and the golden-haired maiden likewise .
As happened before , he was offered by the old man to herd his cows ; and , as she had done to his brothers , the maiden counselled him to leave such work alone .
But , instead of answering rudely , like both Ardan and Ruais , he thanked her , with courtesy , though he had no mind to heed her ; and he listened to the warnings and words of his new master .
Next day he set forth at dawn with the dun cows in front of him , and followed patiently wherever they might lead him .
On the way he saw the gold cock and silver hen , which ran even closer to him than they had done to his brothers .
Sorely tempted , he longed to give them chase ; but , remembering in time that he had been bidden to look neither to the right nor to the left , with a mighty effort he turned his eyes away .
Then the gold and silver staffs seemed to spring from the earth before him , but this time also he overcame ; and though the fruit from the magic tree almost touched his mouth , he brushed it aside and went steadily on .
That day the cows wandered father than ever they had done before , and never stopped till they had reached a moor where the heather was burning .
The fire was fierce , but the cows took no heed , and walked steadily through it , Covan the Brown-haired following them .
Next they plunged into a foaming river , and Covan plunged in after them , though the water came high above his waist .
On the other side of the river lay a wide plain , and here the cows lay down , while Covan looked about him .
Near him was a house built of yellow stone , and from it came sweet songs , and Covan listened , and his heart grew light within him .
While he was thus waiting there ran up to him a youth , scarcely able to speak so swiftly had he sped ; and he cried aloud : ` Hasten , hasten , Covan the Brown-haired , for your cows are in the corn , and you must drive them out ! '
` Nay , ' said Covan smiling , ` it had been easier for you to have driven them out than to come here to tell me . '
And he went on listening to the music .
Very soon the same youth returned and cried with panting breath : ` Out upon you , Covan son of Gorla , that you stand there agape .
For our dogs are chasing your cows , and you must drive them off ! '
` Nay , then , ' answered Covan as before , ` it had been easier for you to call off your dogs than to come here to tell me . '
And he stayed where he was till the music ceased .
Then he turned to look for the cows , and found them all lying in the place where he had left them ; but when they saw Covan they rose up and walked homewards , taking a different path to that they had trod in the morning .
This time they passed over a plain so bare that a pin could not have lain there unnoticed , yet Covan beheld with surprise a foal and its mother feeding there , both as fat as if they had pastured on the richest grass .
Further on they crossed another plain , where the grass was thick and green , but on it were feeding a foal and its mother , so lean that you could have counted their ribs .
And further again the path led them by the shores of a lake whereon were floating two boats ; one full of gay and happy youths , journeying to the land of the Sun , and another with grim shapes clothed in black , travelling to the land of Night .
` What can these things mean ? '
said Covan to himself , as he followed his cows .
Darkness now fell , the wind howled , and torrents of rain poured upon them .
Covan knew not how far they might yet have to go , or indeed if they were on the right road .
He could not even see his cows , and his heart sank lest , after all , he should have failed to bring them safely back .
What was he to do ?
He waited thus , for he could go neither forwards nor backwards , till he felt a great friendly paw laid on his shoulder .
` My cave is just here , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor , of whom Covan son of Gorla had heard much .
` Spend the night here , and you shall be fed on the flesh of lamb , and shall lay aside three-thirds of thy weariness . '
And Covan entered , and supped , and slept , and in the morning rose up a new man .
` Farewell , Covan , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor .
` May success go with you , for you took what I had to give and did not mock me .
So , when danger is your companion , wish for me , and I will not fail you . '
At these words the Dog of Maol-mor disappeared into the forest , and Covan went to seek his cows , which were standing in the hollow where the darkness had come upon them .
At the sight of Covan the Brown-haired they walked onwards , Covan following ever behind them , and looking neither to the right nor to the left .
All that day they walked , and when night fell they were in a barren plain , with only rocks for shelter .
` We must rest here as best we can , ' spoke Covan to the cows .
And they bowed their heads and lay down in the place where they stood .
Then came the black raven of Corri-nan-creag , whose eyes never closed , and whose wings never tired ; and he fluttered before the face of Covan and told him that he knew of a cranny in the rock where there was food in plenty , and soft moss for a bed .
` Go with me thither , ' he said to Covan , ` and you shall lay aside three-thirds of your weariness , and depart in the morning refreshed , ' and Covan listened thankfully to his words , and at dawn he rose up to seek his cows .
` Farewell ! '
cried the black raven .
` You trusted me , and took all I had to offer in return for the food you once gave me .
So if in time to come you need a friend , wish for me , and I will not fail you . '
As before , the cows were standing in the spot where he had left them , ready to set out .
All that day they walked , on and on , and on , Covan son of Gorla walking behind them , till night fell while they were on the banks of a river .
` We can go no further , ' spake Covan to the cows .
And they began to eat the grass by the side of the stream , while Covan listened to them and longed for some supper also , for they had travelled far , and his limbs were weak under him .
Then there was a swish of water at his feet , and out peeped the head of the famous otter Doran-donn of the stream .
` Trust to me and I will find you warmth and shelter , ' said Doran-donn ; ` and for food fish in plenty . '
And Covan went with him thankfully , and ate and rested , and laid aside three-thirds of his weariness .
At sunrise he left his bed of dried sea-weed , which had floated up with the tide , and with a grateful heart bade farewell to Doran-donn .
` Because you trusted me and took what I had to offer , you have made me your friend , Covan , ' said Doran-donn .
` And if you should be in danger , and need help from one who can swim a river or dive beneath a wave , call to me and I will come to you . '
Then he plunged into the stream , and was seen no more .
The cows were standing ready in the place where Covan had left them , and they journeyed on all that day , till , when night fell , they reached the cottage .
Joyful indeed was the old man as the cows went into their stables , and he beheld the rich milk that flowed into the pail of the golden-haired maiden with the silver comb .
` You have done well indeed , ' he said to Covan son of Gorla .
` And now , what would you have as a reward ? ' '
I want nothing for myself , ' answered Covan the Brown-haired ; ` but I ask you to give me back my brothers and my sister who have been lost to us for three years past .
You are wise and know the lore of fairies and of witches ; tell me where I can find them , and what I must do to bring them to life again . '
The old man looked grave at the words of Covan .
` Yes , truly I know where they are , ' answered he , ` and I say not that they may not be brought to life again .
But the perils are great -- too great for you to overcome . '
` Tell me what they are , ' said Covan again , ` and I shall know better if I may overcome them . '
` Listen , then , and judge .
In the mountain yonder there dwells a roe , white of foot , with horns that branch like the antlers of a deer .
On the lake that leads to the land of the Sun floats a duck whose body is green and whose neck is of gold .
In the pool of Corri-Bui swims a salmon with a skin that shines like silver , and whose gills are red -- bring them all to me , and then you shall know where dwell your brothers and your sister ! '
` To-morrow at cock-crow I will begone ! '
answered Covan .
The way to the mountain lay straight before him , and when he had climbed high he caught sight of the roe with the white feet and the spotted sides , on the peak in front .
Full of hope he set out in pursuit of her , but by the time he had reached that peak she had left it and was to be seen on another .
And so it always happened , and Covan 's courage had well-nigh failed him , when the thought of the Dog of Maol-mor darted into his mind .
` Oh , that he was here ! '
he cried .
And looking up he saw him .
` Why did you summon me ? '
asked the Dog of Maol-mor .
And when Covan had told him of his trouble , and how the roe always led him further and further , the Dog only answered : ` Fear nothing ; I will soon catch her for you . '
And in a short while he laid the roe unhurt at Covan 's feet .
` What will you wish me to do with her ? '
said the Dog .
And Covan answered : ` The old man bade me bring her , and the duck with the golden neck , and the salmon with the silver sides , to his cottage ; if I shall catch them , I know not .
But carry you the roe to the back of the cottage , and tether her so that she can not escape . '
` It shall be done , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor .
Then Covan sped to the lake which led to the land of the Sun , where the duck with the green body and the golden neck was swimming among the water-lilies .
` Surely I can catch him , good swimmer as I am , ' to himself .
But , if he could swim well , the duck could swim better , and at length his strength failed him , and he was forced to seek the land .
` Oh that the black raven were here to help me ! '
he thought to himself .
And in a moment the black raven was perched on his shoulder .
` How can I help you ? '
asked the raven .
And Covan answered : ` Catch me the green duck that floats on the water . '
And the raven flew with his strong wings and picked him up in his strong beak , and in another moment the bird was laid at the feet of Covan .
This time it was easy for the young man to carry his prize , and after giving thanks to the raven for his aid , he went on to the river .
In the deep dark pool of which the old man had spoken the silver-sided salmon was lying under a rock .
` Surely I , good fisher as I am , can catch him , ' said Covan son of Gorla .
And cutting a slender pole from a bush , he fastened a line to the end of it .
But cast with what skill he might , it availed nothing , for the salmon would not even look at the bait . '
I am beaten at last , unless the Doran-donn can deliver me , ' he cried .
And as he spoke there was a swish of the water , and the face of the Doran-donn looked up at him . '
O catch me , I pray you , that salmon under the rock ! '
said Covan son of Gorla .
And the Doran-donn dived , and laying hold of the salmon by his tail , bore it back to the place where Covan was standing .
` The roe , and the duck , and the salmon are here , ' said Covan to the old man , when he reached the cottage .
And the old man smiled on him and bade him eat and drink , and after he hungered no more , he would speak with him .
And this was what the old man said : ` You began well , my son , so things have gone well with you .
You set store by your mother 's blessing , therefore you have been blest .
You gave food to the raven when it hungered , you were true to the promise you had made to me , and did not suffer yourself to be turned aside by vain shows .
You were skilled to perceive that the boy who tempted you to leave the temple was a teller of false tales , and took with a grateful heart what the poor had to offer you .
Last of all , difficulties gave you courage , instead of lending you despair .
And now , as to your reward , you shall in truth take your sister home with you , and your brothers I will restore to life ; but idle and unfaithful as they are their lot is to wander for ever .
And so farewell , and may wisdom be with you . '
` First tell me your name ? '
asked Covan softly . '
I am the Spirit of Age , ' said the old man .
The Princess Bella-Flor -LSB- Taken from a Celtic Story .
Translated by Doctor Macleod Clarke . -RSB-
Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons .
When they grew up the elder went to seek his fortune in a far country , and for many years no one heard anything about him .
Meanwhile the younger son stayed at home with his father , who died at last in a good old age , leaving great riches behind him .
For some time the son who stayed at home spent his father 's wealth freely , believing that he alone remained to enjoy it .
But , one day , as he was coming down stairs , he was surprised to see a stranger enter the hall , looking about as if the house belonged to him .
` Have you forgotten me ? '
asked the man . '
I ca n't forget a person I have never known , ' was the rude answer . '
I am your brother , ' replied the stranger , ` and I have returned home without the money I hoped to have made .
And , what is worse , they tell me in the village that my father is dead .
I would have counted my lost gold as nothing if I could have seen him once more . '
` He died six months ago , ' said the rich brother , ` and he left you , as your portion , the old wooden chest that stands in the loft .
You had better go there and look for it ; I have no more time to waste . '
And he went his way .
So the wanderer turned his steps to the loft , which was at the top of the storehouse , and there he found the wooden chest , so old that it looked as if it were dropping to pieces .
` What use is this old thing to me ? '
he said to himself .
` Oh , well , it will serve to light a fire at which I can warm myself ; so things might be worse after all . '
Placing the chest on his back , the man , whose name was Jose , set out for his inn , and , borrowing a hatchet , began to chop up the box .
In doing so he discovered a secret drawer , and in it lay a paper .
He opened the paper , not knowing what it might contain , and was astonished to find that it was the acknowledgment of a large debt that was owing to his father .
Putting the precious writing in his pocket , he hastily inquired of the landlord where he could find the man whose name was written inside , and he ran out at once in search of him .
The debtor proved to be an old miser , who lived at the other end of the village .
He had hoped for many months that the paper he had written had been lost or destroyed , and , indeed , when he saw it , was very unwilling to pay what he owed .
However , the stranger threatened to drag him before the king , and when the miser saw that there was no help for it he counted out the coins one by one .
The stranger picked them up and put them in his pocket , and went back to his inn feeling that he was now a rich man .
A few weeks after this he was walking through the streets of the nearest town , when he met a poor woman crying bitterly .
He stopped and asked her what was the matter , and she answered between her sobs that her husband was dying , and , to make matters worse , a creditor whom he could not pay was anxious to have him taken to prison .
` Comfort yourself , ' said the stranger kindly ; ` they shall neither send your husband to prison nor sell your goods .
I will not only pay his debts but , if he dies , the cost of his burial also .
And now go home , and nurse him as well as you can . '
And so she did ; but , in spite of her care , the husband died , and was buried by the stranger .
But everything cost more than he expected , and when all was paid he found that only three gold pieces were left .
` What am I to do now ? '
said he to himself . '
I think I had better go to court , and enter into the service of the king . '
At first he was only a servant , who carried the king the water for his bath , and saw that his bed was made in a particular fashion .
But he did his duties so well that his master soon took notice of him , and in a short time he rose to be a gentleman of the bedchamber .
Now , when this happened the younger brother had spent all the money he had inherited , and did not know how to make any for himself .
He then bethought him of the king 's favourite , and went whining to the palace to beg that his brother , whom he had so ill-used , would give him his protection , and find him a place .
The elder , who was always ready to help everyone spoke to the king on his behalf , and the next day the young man took up is work at court .
Unfortunately , the new-comer was by nature spiteful and envious , and could not bear anyone to have better luck than himself .
By dint of spying through keyholes and listening at doors , he learned that the king , old and ugly though he was , had fallen in love with the Princess Bella-Flor , who would have nothing to say to him , and had hidden herself in some mountain castle , no one knew where .
` That will do nicely , ' thought the scoundrel , rubbing his hands .
` It will be quite easy to get the king to send my brother in search of her , and if he returns without finding her , his head will be the forfeit .
Either way , he will be out of MY path . '
So he went at once to the Lord High Chamberlain and craved an audience of the king , to whom he declared he wished to tell some news of the highest importance .
The king admitted him into the presence chamber without delay , and bade him state what he had to say , and to be quick about it .
` Oh , sire !
the Princess Bella-Flor -- ' answered the man , and then stopped as if afraid .
` What of the Princess Bella-Flor ? '
asked the king impatiently . '
I have heard -- it is whispered at court -- that your majesty desires to know where she lies in hiding . ' '
I would give half my kingdom to the man who will bring her to me , ' cried the king , eagerly .
` Speak on , knave ; has a bird of the air revealed to you the secret ? '
` It is not I , but my brother , who knows , ' replied the traitor ; ` if your majesty would ask him -- ' But before the words were out of his mouth the king had struck a blow with his sceptre on a golden plate that hung on the wall .
` Order Jose to appear before me instantly , ' he shouted to the servant who ran to obey his orders , so great was the noise his majesty had made ; and when Jose entered the hall , wondering what in the world could be the matter , the king was nearly dumb from rage and excitement .
` Bring me the Princess Bella-Flor this moment , ' stammered he , ` for if you return without her I will have you drowned ! '
And without another word he left the hall , leaving Jose staring with surprise and horror .
` How can I find the Princess Bella-Flor when I have never even seen her ? '
thought he .
` But it is no use staying here , for I shall only be put to death . '
And he walked slowly to the stables to choose himself a horse .
There were rows upon rows of fine beasts with their names written in gold above their stalls , and Jose was looking uncertainly from one to the other , wondering which he should choose , when an old white horse turned its head and signed to him to approach .
` Take me , ' it said in a gentle whisper , ` and all will go well . '
Jose still felt so bewildered with the mission that the king had given him that he forgot to be astonished at hearing a horse talk .
Mechanically he laid his hand on the bridle and led the white horse out of the stable .
He was about to mount on his back , when the animal spoke again : ` Pick up those three loaves of bread which you see there , and put them in your pocket . '
Jose did as he was told , and being in a great hurry to get away , asked no questions , but swung himself into the saddle .
They rode far without meeting any adventures , but at length they came to an ant-hill , and the horse stopped .
` Crumble those three loaves for the ants , ' he said .
But Jose hesitated .
` Why , we may want them ourselves ! '
answered he .
` Never mind that ; give them to the ants all the same .
Do not lose a chance of helping others . '
And when the loaves lay in crumbs on the road , the horse galloped on .
By-and-by they entered a rocky pass between two mountains , and here they saw an eagle which had been caught in a hunter 's net .
` Get down and cut the meshes of the net , and set the poor bird free , ' said the horse .
` But it will take so long , ' objected Jose , ` and we may miss the princess . '
` Never mind that ; do not lose a chance of helping others , ' answered the horse .
And when the meshes were cut , and the eagle was free , the horse galloped on .
The had ridden many miles , and at last they came to a river , where they beheld a little fish lying gasping on the sand , and the horse said : ` Do you see that little fish ?
It will die if you do not put it back in the water . '
` But , really , we shall never find the Princess Bella-Flor if we waste our time like this ! '
cried Jose .
` We never waste time when we are helping others , ' answered the horse .
And soon the little fish was swimming happily away .
A little while after they reached a castle , which was built in the middle of a very thick wood , and right in front was the Princess Bella-Flor feeding her hens .
` Now listen , ' said the horse . '
I am going to give all sorts of little hops and skips , which will amuse the Princess Bella-Flor .
Then she will tell you that she would like to ride a little way , and you must help her to mount .
When she is seated I shall begin to neigh and kick , and you must say that I have never carried a woman before , and that you had better get up behind so as to be able to manage me .
Once on my back we will go like the wind to the king 's palace . '
Jose did exactly as the horse told him , and everything fell out as the animal prophesied ; so that it was not until they were galloping breathlessly towards the palace that the princess knew that she was taken captive .
She said nothing , however , but quietly opened her apron which contained the bran for the chickens , and in a moment it lay scattered on the ground .
` Oh , I have let fall my bran ! '
cried she ; ` please get down and pick it up for me . '
But Jose only answered : ` We shall find plenty of bran where we are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
They were now passing through a forest , and the princess took out her handkerchief and threw it upwards , so that it stuck in one of the topmost branches of a tree .
` Dear me ; how stupid !
I have let my handkerchief blow away , ' said she .
` Will you climb up and get it for me ? '
But Jose answered : ` We shall find plenty of handkerchiefs where we are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
After the wood they reached a river , and the princess slipped a ring off her finger and let it roll into the water .
` How careless of me , ' gasped she , beginning to sob . '
I have lost my favourite ring ; DO stop for a moment and look if you can see it . '
But Jose answered : ` You will find plenty of rings where you are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
At last they entered the palace gates , and the king 's heart bounded with joy at beholding his beloved Princess Bella-Flor .
But the princess brushed him aside as if he had been a fly , and locked herself into the nearest room , which she would not open for all his entreaties .
` Bring me the three things I lost on the way , and perhaps I may think about it , ' was all she would say .
And , in despair , the king was driven to take counsel of Jose .
` There is no remedy that I can see , ' said his majesty , ` but that you , who know where they are , should go and bring them back .
And if you return without them I will have you drowned . '
Poor Jose was much troubled at these words .
He thought that he had done all that was required of him , and that his life was safe .
However , he bowed low , and went out to consult his friend the horse .
` Do not vex yourself , ' said the horse , when he had heard the story ; ` jump up , and we will go and look for the things . '
And Jose mounted at once .
They rode on till they came to the ant-hill , and then the horse asked : ` Would you like to have the bran ? '
` What is the use of liking ? '
answered Jose .
` Well , call the ants , and tell them to fetch it for you ; and , if some of it has been scattered by the wind , to bring in its stead the grains that were in the cakes you gave them . '
Jose listened in surprise .
He did not much believe in the horse 's plan ; but he could not think of anything better , so he called to the ants , and bade them collect the bran as fast as they could .
Then he saw under a tree and waited , while his horse cropped the green turf .
` Look there ! '
said the animal , suddenly raising its head ; and Jose looked behind him and saw a little mountain of bran , which he put into a bag that was hung over his saddle .
` Good deeds bear fruit sooner or later , ' observed the horse ; ` but mount again , as we have far to go . '
When they arrived at the tree , they saw the handkerchief fluttering like a flag from the topmost branch , and Jose 's spirits sank again .
` How am I to get that handkerchief ? '
cried he ; ` why I should need Jacob 's ladder ! '
But the horse answered : ` Do not be frightened ; call to the eagle you set free from the net , he will bring it to you . '
So Jose called to the eagle , and the eagle flew to the top of the tree and brought back the handkerchief in its beak .
Jose thanked him , and vaulting on his horse they rode on to the river .
A great deal of rain had fallen in the night , and the river , instead of being clear as it was before , was dark and troubled .
` How am I to fetch the ring from the bottom of this river when I do not know exactly where it was dropped , and can not even see it ? '
asked Jose .
But the horse answered : ` Do not be frightened ; call the little fish whose life you saved , and she will bring it to you . '
So he called to the fish , and the fish dived to the bottom and slipped behind big stones , and moved little ones with its tail till it found the ring , and brought it to Jose in its mouth .
Well pleased with all he had done , Jose returned to the palace ; but when the king took the precious objects to Bella-Flor , she declared that she would never open her door till the bandit who had carried her off had been fried in oil . '
I am very sorry , ' said the king to Jose , ' I really would rather not ; but you see I have no choice . '
While the oil was being heated in the great caldron , Jose went to the stables to inquire of his friend the horse if there was no way for him to escape .
` Do not be frightened , ' said the horse .
` Get on my back , and I will gallop till my whole body is wet with perspiration , then rub it all over your skin , and no matter how hot the oil may be you will never feel it . '
Jose did not ask any more questions , but did as the horse bade him ; and men wondered at his cheerful face as they lowered him into the caldron of boiling oil .
He was left there till Bella-Flor cried that he must be cooked enough .
Then out came a youth so young and handsome , that everyone fell in love with him , and Bella-Flor most of all .
As for the old king , he saw that he had lost the game ; and in despair he flung himself into the caldron , and was fried instead of Jose .
Then Jose was proclaimed king , on condition that he married Bella-Flor which he promised to do the next day .
But first he went to the stables and sought out the horse , and said to him : ` It is to you that I owe my life and my crown .
Why have you done all this for me ? '
And the horse answered : ' I am the soul of that unhappy man for whom you spent all your fortune .
And when I saw you in danger of death I begged that I might help you , as you had helped me .
For , as I told you , Good deeds bear their own fruit ! '
The Bird of Truth -LSB- From Cuentos , Oraciones , y Adivinas , por Fernan Caballero . -RSB-
Once upon a time there lived a poor fisher who built a hut on the banks of a stream which , shunning the glare of the sun and the noise of the towns , flowed quietly past trees and under bushes , listening to the songs of the birds overhead .
One day , when the fisherman had gone out as usual to cast his nets , he saw borne towards him on the current a cradle of crystal .
Slipping his net quickly beneath it he drew it out and lifted the silk coverlet .
Inside , lying on a soft bed of cotton , were two babies , a boy and a girl , who opened their eyes and smiled at him .
The man was filled with pity at the sight , and throwing down his lines he took the cradle and the babies home to his wife .
The good woman flung up her hands in despair when she beheld the contents of the cradle .
` Are not eight children enough , ' she cried , ` without bringing us two more ?
How do you think we can feed them ? '
` You would not have had me leave them to die of hunger , ' answered he , ` or be swallowed up by the waves of the sea ?
What is enough for eight is also enough for ten . '
The wife said no more ; and in truth her heart yearned over the little creatures .
Somehow or other food was never lacking in the hut , and the children grew up and were so good and gentle that , in time , their foster-parents loved them as well or better than their own , who were quarrelsome and envious .
It did not take the orphans long to notice that the boys did not like them , and were always playing tricks on them , so they used to go away by themselves and spend whole hours by the banks of the river .
Here they would take out the bits of bread they had saved from their breakfasts and crumble them for the birds .
In return , the birds taught them many things : how to get up early in the morning , how to sing , and how to talk their language , which very few people know .
But though the little orphans did their best to avoid quarrelling with their foster-brothers , it was very difficult always to keep the peace .
Matters got worse and worse till , one morning , the eldest boy said to the twins : ` It is all very well for you to pretend that you have such good manners , and are so much better than we , but we have at least a father and mother , while you have only got the river , like the toads and the frogs . '
The poor children did not answer the insult ; but it made them very unhappy .
And they told each other in whispers that they could not stay there any longer , but must go into the world and seek their fortunes .
So next day they arose as early as the birds and stole downstairs without anybody hearing them .
One window was open , and they crept softly out and ran to the side of the river .
Then , feeling as if they had found a friend , they walked along its banks , hoping that by-and-by they should meet some one to take care of them .
The whole of that day they went steadily on without seeing a living creature , till , in the evening , weary and footsore , they saw before them a small hut .
This raised their spirits for a moment ; but the door was shut , and the hut seemed empty , and so great was their disappointment that they almost cried .
However , the boy fought down his tears , and said cheerfully : ` Well , at any rate here is a bench where we can sit down , and when we are rested we will think what is best to do next . '
Then they sat down , and for some time they were too tired even to notice anything ; but by-and-by they saw that under the tiles of the roof a number of swallows were sitting , chattering merrily to each other .
Of course the swallows had no idea that the children understood their language , or they would not have talked so freely ; but , as it was , they said whatever came into their heads .
` Good evening , my fine city madam , ' remarked a swallow , whose manners were rather rough and countryfied to another who looked particularly distinguished .
` Happy , indeed , are the eyes that behold you !
Only think of your having returned to your long-forgotten country friends , after you have lived for years in a palace ! ' '
I have inherited this nest from my parents , ' replied the other , ` and as they left it to me I certainly shall make it my home .
But , ' she added politely , ' I hope that you and all your family are well ? '
` Very well indeed , I am glad to say .
But my poor daughter had , a short time ago , such bad inflammation in her eyes that she would have gone blind had I not been able to find the magic herb , which cured her at once . '
` And how is the nightingale singing ?
Does the lark soar as high as ever ?
And does the linnet dress herself as smartly ? '
But here the country swallow drew herself up . '
I never talk gossip , ' she said severely .
` Our people , who were once so innocent and well-behaved , have been corrupted by the bad examples of men .
It is a thousand pities . '
` What !
innocence and good behaviour are not to be met with among birds , nor in the country !
My dear friend , what are you saying ? '
` The truth and nothing more .
Imagine , when we returned here , we met some linnets who , just as the spring and the flowers and the long days had come , were setting out for the north and the cold ?
Out of pure compassion we tried to persuade them to give up this folly ; but they only replied with the utmost insolence . '
` How shocking ! '
exclaimed the city swallow .
` Yes , it was .
And worse than that , the crested lark , that was formerly so timid and shy , is now no better than a thief , and steals maize and corn whenever she can find them . ' '
I am astonished at what you say . '
` You will be more astonished when I tell you that on my arrival here for the summer I found my nest occupied by a shameless sparrow !
`` This is my nest , '' I said .
`` Yours ? ''
he answered , with a rude laugh .
`` Yes , mine ; my ancestors were born here , and my sons will be born here also . ''
And at that my husband set upon him and threw him out of the nest .
I am sure nothing of this sort ever happens in a town . '
` Not exactly , perhaps .
But I have seen a great deal -- if you only knew ! '
` Oh !
do tell us !
do tell us ! '
cried they all .
And when they had settled themselves comfortably , the city swallow began : ` You must know , then that our king fell in love with the youngest daughter of a tailor , who was as good and gentle as she was beautiful .
His nobles hoped that he would have chosen a queen from one of their daughters , and tried to prevent the marriage ; but the king would not listen to them , and it took place .
Not many months later a war broke out , and the king rode away at the head of his army , while the queen remained behind , very unhappy at the separation .
When peace was made , and the king returned , he was told that his wife had had two babies in his absence , but that both were dead ; that she herself had gone out of her mind and was obliged to be shut up in a tower in the mountains , where , in time , the fresh air might cure her . '
` And was this not true ? '
asked the swallows eagerly .
` Of course not , ' answered the city lady , with some contempt for their stupidity .
` The children were alive at that very moment in the gardener 's cottage ; but at night the chamberlain came down and put them in a cradle of crystal , which he carried to the river .
` For a whole day they floated safely , for though the stream was deep it was very still , and the children took no harm .
In the morning -- so I am told by my friend the kingfisher -- they were rescued by a fisherman who lived near the river bank . '
The children had been lying on the bench , listening lazily to the chatter up to this point ; but when they heard the story of the crystal cradle which their foster-mother had always been fond of telling them , they sat upright and looked at each other .
` Oh , how glad I am I learnt the birds ' language ! '
said the eyes of one to the eyes of the other .
Meanwhile the swallows had spoken again .
` That was indeed good fortune ! '
cried they .
` And when the children are grown up they can return to their father and set their mother free . '
` It will not be so easy as you think , ' answered the city swallow , shaking her head ; ` for they will have to prove that they are the king 's children , and also that their mother never went mad at all .
In fact , it is so difficult that there is only one way of proving it to the king . '
` And what is that ? '
cried all the swallows at once .
` And how do you know it ? ' '
I know it , ' answered the city swallow , ` because , one day , when I was passing through the palace garden , I met a cuckoo , who , as I need not tell you , always pretends to be able to see into the future .
We began to talk about certain things which were happening in the palace , and of the events of past years .
`` Ah , '' said he , `` the only person who can expose the wickedness of the ministers and show the king how wrong he has been , is the Bird of Truth , who can speak the language of men . '' '
`` And where can this bird be found ? ''
I asked . '
`` It is shut up in a castle guarded by a fierce giant , who only sleeps one quarter of an hour out of the whole twenty-four , '' replied the cuckoo .
` And where is this castle ? '
inquired the country swallow , who , like all the rest , and the children most of all , had been listening with deep attention .
` That is just what I do n't know , ' answered her friend .
` All I can tell you is that not far from here is a tower , where dwells an old witch , and it is she who knows the way , and she will only teach it to the person who promises to bring her the water from the fountain of many colours , which she uses for her enchantments .
But never will she betray the place where the Bird of Truth is hidden , for she hates him , and would kill him if she could ; knowing well , however , that this bird can not die , as he is immortal , she keeps him closely shut up , and guarded night and day by the Birds of Bad Faith , who seek to gag him so that his voice should not be heard . '
` And is there no one else who can tell the poor boy where to find the bird , if he should ever manage to reach the tower ? '
asked the country swallow .
` No one , ' replied the city swallow , ` except an owl , who lives a hermit 's life in that desert , and he knows only one word of man 's speech , and that is `` cross . ''
So that even if the prince did succeed in getting there , he could never understand what the owl said .
But , look , the sun is sinking to his nest in the depths of the sea , and I must go to mine .
Good-night , friends , good-night ! '
Then the swallow flew away , and the children , who had forgotten both hunger and weariness in the joy of this strange news , rose up and followed in the direction of her flight .
After two hours ' walking , they arrived at a large city , which they felt sure must be the capital of their father 's kingdom .
Seeing a good-natured looking woman standing at the door of a house , they asked her if she would give them a night 's lodging , and she was so pleased with their pretty faces and nice manners that she welcomed them warmly .
It was scarcely light the next morning before the girl was sweeping out the rooms , and the boy watering the garden , so that by the time the good woman came downstairs there was nothing left for her to do .
This so delighted her that she begged the children to stay with her altogether , and the boy answered that he would leave his sisters with her gladly , but that he himself had serious business on hand and must not linger in pursuit of it .
So he bade them farewell and set out .
For three days he wandered by the most out-of-the-way paths , but no signs of a tower were to be seen anywhere .
On the fourth morning it was just the same , and , filled with despair , he flung himself on the ground under a tree and hid his face in his hands .
In a little while he heard a rustling over his head , and looking up , he saw a turtle dove watching him with her bright eyes .
` Oh dove ! '
cried the boy , addressing the bird in her own language , ` Oh dove !
tell me , I pray you , where is the castle of Come-and-never-go ? '
` Poor child , ' answered the dove , ` who has sent you on such a useless quest ? '
` My good or evil fortune , ' replied the boy , ' I know not which . '
` To get there , ' said the dove , ` you must follow the wind , which to-day is blowing towards the castle . '
The boy thanked her , and followed the wind , fearing all the time that it might change its direction and lead him astray .
But the wind seemed to feel pity for him and blew steadily on .
With each step the country became more and more dreary , but at nightfall the child could see behind the dark and bare rocks something darker still .
This was the tower in which dwelt the witch ; and seizing the knocker he gave three loud knocks , which were echoed in the hollows of the rocks around .
The door opened slowly , and there appeared on the threshold an old woman holding up a candle to her face , which was so hideous that the boy involuntarily stepped backwards , almost as frightened by the troop of lizards , beetles and such creatures that surrounded her , as by the woman herself .
` Who are you who dare to knock at my door and wake me ? '
cried she .
` Be quick and tell me what you want , or it will be the worse for you . '
` Madam , ' answered the child , ' I believe that you alone know the way to the castle of Come-and-never-go , and I pray you to show it to me . '
` Very good , ' replied the witch , with something that she meant for a smile , ` but to-day it is late .
To-morrow you shall go .
Now enter , and you shall sleep with my lizards . ' '
I can not stay , ' said he . '
I must go back at once , so as to reach the road from which I started before day dawns . '
` If I tell you , will you promise me that you will bring me this jar full of the many-coloured water from the spring in the court-yard of the castle ? '
asked she .
` If you fail to keep your word I will change you into a lizard for ever . ' '
I promise , ' answered the boy .
Then the old woman called to a very thin dog , and said to him : ` Conduct this pig of a child to the castle of Come-and-never-go , and take care that you warn my friend of his arrival . '
And the dog arose and shook itself , and set out .
At the end of two hours they stopped in front of a large castle , big and black and gloomy , whose doors stood wide open , although neither sound nor light gave sign of any presence within .
The dog , however , seemed to know what to expect , and , after a wild howl , went on ; but the boy , who was uncertain whether this was the quarter of an hour when the giant was asleep , hesitated to follow him , and paused for a moment under a wild olive that grew near by , the only tree which he had beheld since he had parted from the dove .
` Oh , heaven , help me ! '
cried he .
` Cross !
cross ! '
answered a voice .
The boy leapt for joy as he recognised the note of the owl of which the swallow had spoken , and he said softly in the bird 's language : ` Oh , wise owl , I pray you to protect and guide me , for I have come in search of the Bird of Truth .
And first I must fill this far with the many-coloured water in the courtyard of the castle . '
` Do not do that , ' answered the owl , ` but fill the jar from the spring which bubbles close by the fountain with the many-coloured water .
Afterwards , go into the aviary opposite the great door , but be careful not to touch any of the bright-plumaged birds contained in it , which will cry to you , each one , that he is the Bird of Truth .
Choose only a small white bird that is hidden in a corner , which the others try incessantly to kill , not knowing that it can not die .
And , be quick !
-- for at this very moment the giant has fallen asleep , and you have only a quarter of an hour to do everything . '
The boy ran as fast as he could and entered the courtyard , where he saw the two spring close together .
He passed by the many-coloured water without casting a glance at it , and filled the jar from the fountain whose water was clear and pure .
He next hastened to the aviary , and was almost deafened by the clamour that rose as he shut the door behind him .
Voices of peacocks , voices of ravens , voices of magpies , each claiming to be the Bird of Truth .
With steadfast face the boy walked by them all , to the corner , where , hemmed in by a hand of fierce crows , was the small white bird he sought .
Putting her safely in his breast , he passed out , followed by the screams of the birds of Bad Faith which he left behind him .
Once outside , he ran without stopping to the witch 's tower , and handed to the old woman the jar she had given him .
` Become a parrot ! '
cried she , flinging the water over him .
But instead of losing his shape , as so many had done before , he only grew ten times handsomer ; for the water was enchanted for good and not ill .
Then the creeping multitude around the witch hastened to roll themselves in the water , and stood up , human beings again .
When the witch saw what was happening , she took a broomstick and flew away .
Who can guess the delight of the sister at the sight of her brother , bearing the Bird of Truth ?
But although the boy had accomplished much , something very difficult yet remained , and that was how to carry the Bird of Truth to the king without her being seized by the wicked courtiers , who would be ruined by the discovery of their plot .
Soon -- no one knew how -- the news spread abroad that the Bird of Truth was hovering round the palace , and the courtiers made all sorts of preparations to hinder her reaching the king .
They got ready weapons that were sharpened , and weapons that were poisoned ; they sent for eagles and falcons to hunt her down , and constructed cages and boxes in which to shut her up if they were not able to kill her .
They declared that her white plumage was really put on to hide her black feathers -- in fact there was nothing they did not do in order to prevent the king from seeing the bird or from paying attention to her words if he did .
As often happens in these cases , the courtiers brought about that which they feared .
They talked so much about the Bird of Truth that at last the king heard of it , and expressed a wish to see her .
The more difficulties that were put in his way the stronger grew his desire , and in the end the king published a proclamation that whoever found the Bird of Truth should bring her to him without delay .
As soon as he saw this proclamation the boy called his sister , and they hastened to the palace .
The bird was buttoned inside his tunic , but , as might have been expected , the courtiers barred the way , and told the child that he could not enter .
It was in vain that the boy declared that he was only obeying the king 's commands ; the courtiers only replied that his majesty was not yet out of bed , and it was forbidden to wake him .
They were still talking , when , suddenly , the bird settled the question by flying upwards through an open window into the king 's own room .
Alighting on the pillow , close to the king 's head , she bowed respectfully , and said : ` My lord , I am the Bird of Truth whom you wished to see , and I have been obliged to approach you in the manner because the boy who brought me is kept out of the palace by your courtiers . '
` They shall pay for their insolence , ' said the king .
And he instantly ordered one of his attendants to conduct the boy at once to his apartments ; and in a moment more the prince entered , holding his sister by the hand .
` Who are you ? '
asked the king ; ` and what has the Bird of Truth to do with you ? '
` If it please your majesty , the Bird of Truth will explain that herself , ' answered the boy .
And the bird did explain ; and the king heard for the first time of the wicked plot that had been successful for so many years .
He took his children in his arms , with tears in his eyes , and hurried off with them to the tower in the mountains where the queen was shut up .
The poor woman was as white as marble , for she had been living almost in darkness ; but when she saw her husband and children , the colour came back to her face , and she was as beautiful as ever .
They all returned in state to the city , where great rejoicings were held .
The wicked courtiers had their heads cut off , and all their property was taken away .
As for the good old couple , they were given riches and honour , and were loved and cherished to the end of their lives .
The Mink and the Wolf -LSB- From Cuentos , Oraciones y Adivinas , por Fernan Caballero . -RSB-
In a big forest in the north of America lived a quantity of wild animals of all sorts .
They were always very polite when they met ; but , in spite of that , they kept a close watch one upon the other , as each was afraid of being killed and eaten by somebody else .
But their manners were so good that no one would ever had guessed that .
One day a smart young wolf went out to hunt , promising his grandfather and grandmother that he would be sure to be back before bedtime .
He trotted along quite happily through the forest till he came to a favourite place of his , just where the river runs into the sea .
There , just as he had hoped , he saw the chief mink fishing in a canoe . '
I want to fish too , ' cried the wolf .
But the mink said nothing and pretended not to hear . '
I wish you would take me into your boat ! '
shouted the wolf , louder than before , and he continued to beseech the mink so long that at last he grew tired of it , and paddled to the shore close enough for the wolf to jump in .
` Sit down quietly at that end or we shall be upset , ' said the mink ; ` and if you care about sea-urchins ' eggs , you will find plenty in that basket .
But be sure you eat only the white ones , for the red ones would kill you . '
So the wolf , who was always hungry , began to eat the eggs greedily ; and when he had finished he told the mink he thought he would have a nap .
` Well , then , stretch yourself out , and rest your head on that piece of wood , ' said the mink .
And the wolf did as he was bid , and was soon fast asleep .
Then the mink crept up to him and stabbed him to the heart with his knife , and he died without moving .
After that he landed on the beach , skinned the wolf , and taking the skin to his cottage , he hung it up before the fire to dry .
Not many days later the wolf 's grandmother , who , with the help of her relations , had been searching for him everywhere , entered the cottage to buy some sea-urchins ' eggs , and saw the skin , which she at once guessed to be that of her grandson . '
I knew he was dead -- I knew it !
I knew it ! '
she cried , weeping bitterly , till the mink told her rudely that if she wanted to make so much noise she had better do it outside as he liked to be quiet .
So , half-blinded by her tears , the old woman went home the way she had come , and running in at the door , she flung herself down in front of the fire .
` What are you crying for ? '
asked the old wolf and some friends who had been spending the afternoon with him . '
I shall never see my grandson any more ! '
answered she .
` Mink has killed him , oh !
oh ! '
And putting her head down , she began to weep as loudly as ever .
` There !
there ! '
said her husband , laying his paw on her shoulder .
` Be comforted ; if he IS dead , we will avenge him . '
And calling to the others they proceeded to talk over the best plan .
It took them a long time to make up their minds , as one wolf proposed one thing and one another ; but at last it was agreed that the old wolf should give a great feast in his house , and that the mink should be invited to the party .
And in order that no time should be lost it was further agreed that each wolf should bear the invitations to the guests that lived nearest to him .
Now the wolves thought they were very cunning , but the mink was more cunning still ; and though he sent a message by a white hare , that was going that way , saying he should be delighted to be present , he determined that he would take his precautions .
So he went to a mouse who had often done him a good turn , and greeted her with his best bow . '
I have a favour to ask of you , friend mouse , ' said he , ` and if you will grant it I will carry you on my back every night for a week to the patch of maize right up the hill . '
` The favour is mine , ' answered the mouse .
` Tell me what it is that I can have the honour of doing for you . '
` Oh , something quite easy , ' replied the mink . '
I only want you -- between to-day and the next full moon -- to gnaw through the bows and paddles of the wolf people , so that directly they use them they will break .
But of course you must manage it so that they notice nothing . '
` Of course , ' answered the mouse , ` nothing is easier ; but as the full moon is to-morrow night , and there is not much time , I had better begin at once . '
Then the mink thanked her , and went his way ; but before he had gone far he came back again .
` Perhaps , while you are about the wolf 's house seeing after the bows , it would do no harm if you were to make that knot-hole in the wall a little bigger , ' said he .
` Not large enough to draw attention , of course ; but it might come in handy . '
And with another nod he left her .
The next evening the mink washed and brushed himself carefully and set out for the feast .
He smiled to himself as he looked at the dusty track , and perceived that though the marks of wolves ' feet were many , not a single guest was to be seen anywhere .
He knew very well what that meant ; but he had taken his precautions and was not afraid .
The house door stood open , but through a crack the mink could see the wolves crowding in the corner behind it .
However , he entered boldly , and as soon as he was fairly inside the door was shut with a bang , and the whole herd sprang at him , with their red tongues hanging out of their mouths .
Quick as they were they were too late , for the mink was already through the knot-hole and racing for his canoe .
The knot-hole was too small for the wolves , and there were so many of them in the hut that it was some time before they could get the door open .
Then they seized the bows and arrows which were hanging on the walls and , once outside , aimed at the flying mink ; but as they pulled the bows broke in their paws , so they threw them away , and bounded to the shore , with all their speed , to the place where their canoes were drawn up on the beach .
Now , although the mink could not run as fast as the wolves , he had a good start , and was already afloat when the swiftest among them threw themselves into the nearest canoe .
They pushed off , but as they dipped the paddles into the water , they snapped as the bows had done , and were quite useless . '
I know where there are some new ones , ' cried a young fellow , leaping on shore and rushing to a little cave at the back of the beach .
And the mink 's heart smote him when he heard , for he had not known of this secret store .
After a long chase the wolves managed to surround their prey , and the mink , seeing it was no good resisting any more , gave himself up .
Some of the elder wolves brought out some cedar bands , which they always carried wound round their bodies , but the mink laughed scornfully at the sight of them .
` Why I could snap those in a moment , ' said he ; ` if you want to make sure that I can not escape , better take a line of kelp and bind me with that . '
` You are right , ' answered the grandfather ; ` your wisdom is greater than ours . '
And he bade his servants gather enough kelp from the rocks to make a line , as they had brought none with them .
` While the line is being made you might as well let me have one last dance , ' remarked the mink .
And the wolves replied : ` Very good , you may have your dance ; perhaps it may amuse us as well as you . '
So they brought two canoes and placed them one beside the other .
The mink stood up on his hind legs and began to dance , first in one canoe and then in the other ; and so graceful was he , that the wolves forgot they were going to put him to death , and howled with pleasure .
` Pull the canoes a little apart ; they are too close for this new dance , ' he said , pausing for a moment .
And the wolves separated them while he gave a series of little springs , sometime pirouetting while he stood with one foot on the prow of both .
` Now nearer , now further apart , ' he would cry as the dance went on .
` No !
further still . '
And springing into the air , amidst howls of applause , he came down head-foremost , and dived to the bottom .
And through the wolves , whose howls had now changed into those of rage , sought him everywhere , they never found him , for he hid behind a rock till they were out of sight , and then made his home in another forest .
Adventures of an Indian Brave -LSB- From the Journal of the Anthropological Institute . -RSB-
A long , long way off , right away in the west of America , there once lived an old man who had one son .
The country round was covered with forests , in which dwelt all kinds of wild beasts , and the young man and his companions used to spend whole days in hunting them , and he was the finest hunter of all the tribe .
One morning , when winter was coming on , the youth and his companions set off as usual to bring back some of the mountain goats and deer to be salted down , as he was afraid of a snow-storm ; and if the wind blew and the snow drifted the forest might be impassable for some weeks .
The old man and the wife , however , would not go out , but remained in the wigwam making bows and arrows .
It soon grew so cold in the forest that at last one of the men declared they could walk no more , unless they could manage to warm themselves .
` That is easily done , ' said the leader , giving a kick to a large tree .
Flames broke out in the trunk , and before it had burnt up they were as hot as if it had been summer .
Then they started off to the place where the goats and deer were to be found in the greatest numbers , and soon had killed as many as they wanted .
But the leader killed most , as he was the best shot .
` Now we must cut up the game and divide it , ' said he ; and so they did , each one taking his own share ; and , walking one behind the other , set out for the village .
But when they reached a great river the young man did not want the trouble of carrying his pack any further , and left it on the bank . '
I am going home another way , ' he told his companions .
And taking another road he reached the village long before they did .
` Have you returned with empty hands ? '
asked the old man , as his son opened the door .
` Have I ever done that , that you put me such a question ? '
asked the youth .
` No ; I have slain enough to feast us for many moons , but it was heavy , and I left the pack on the bank of the great river .
Give me the arrows , I will finish making them , and you can go to the river and bring home the pack ! '
So the old man rose and went , and strapped the meat on his shoulder ; but as he was crossing the ford the strap broke and the pack fell into the river .
He stooped to catch it , but it swirled past him .
He clutched again ; but in doing so he over-balanced himself and was hurried into some rapids , where he was knocked against some rocks , and he sank and was drowned , and his body was carried down the stream into smoother water when it rose to the surface again .
But by this time it had lost all likeness to a man , and was changed into a piece of wood .
The wood floated on , and the river got bigger and bigger and entered a new country .
There it was borne by the current close to the shore , and a woman who was down there washing her clothes caught it as it passed , and drew it out , saying to herself : ` What a nice smooth plank !
I will use it as a table to put my food upon . '
And gathering up her clothes she took the plank with her into her hut .
When her supper time came she stretched the board across two strings which hung from the roof , and set upon it the pot containing a stew that smelt very good .
The woman had been working hard all day and was very hungry , so she took her biggest spoon and plunged it into the pot .
But what was her astonishment and disgust when both pot and food vanished instantly before her !
` Oh , you horrid plank , you have brought me ill-luck ! '
she cried .
And taking it up she flung it away from her .
The woman had been surprised before at the disappearance of her food , but she was more astonished still when , instead of the plank , she beheld a baby .
However , she was fond of children and had none of her own , so she made up her mind that she would keep it and take care of it .
The baby grew and throve as no baby in that country had ever done , and in four days he was a man , and as tall and strong as any brave of the tribe .
` You have treated me well , ' he said , ` and meat shall never fail to your house .
But now I must go , for I have much work to do . '
Then he set out for his home .
It took him many days to get there , and when he saw his son sitting in his place his anger was kindled , and his heart was stirred to take vengeance upon him .
So he went out quickly into the forest and shed tears , and each tear became a bird .
` Stay there till I want you , ' said he ; and he returned to the hut . '
I saw some pretty new birds , high up in a tree yonder , ' he remarked .
And the son answered : ` Show me the way and I will get them for dinner . '
The two went out together , and after walking for about half an hour they old man stopped .
` That is the tree , ' he said .
And the son began to climb it .
Now a strange thing happened .
The higher the young man climbed the higher the birds seemed to be , and when he looked down the earth below appeared no bigger than a star .
Sill he tried to go back , but he could not , and though he could not see the birds any longer he felt as if something were dragging him up and up .
He thought that he had been climbing that tree for days , and perhaps he had , for suddenly a beautiful country , yellow with fields of maize , stretched before him , and he gladly left the top of the tree and entered it .
He walked through the maize without knowing where he was going , when he heard a sound of knocking , and saw two old blind women crushing their food between two stones .
He crept up to them on tiptoe , and when one old woman passed her dinner to the other he held out his hand and took it and ate if for himself .
` How slow you are kneading that cake , ' cried the other old woman at last .
` Why , I have given you your dinner , and what more do you want ? '
replied the second .
` You did n't ; at least I never got it , ' said the other . '
I certainly thought you took it from me ; but here is some more . '
And again the young man stretched out his hand ; and the two old women fell to quarrelling afresh .
But when it happened for the third time the old women suspected some trick , and one of them exclaimed : ' I am sure there is a man here ; tell me , are you not my grandson ? '
` Yes , ' answered the young man , who wished to please her , ` and in return for your good dinner I will see if I can not restore your sight ; for I was taught in the art of healing by the best medicine man in the tribe . '
And with that he left them , and wandered about till he found the herb which he wanted .
Then he hastened back to the old women , and begging them to boil him some water , he threw the herb in .
As soon as the pot began to sing he took off the lid , and sprinkled the eyes of the women , and sight came back to them once more .
There was no night in that country , so , instead of going to bed very early , as he would have done in his own hut , the young man took another walk .
A splashing noise near by drew him down to a valley through which ran a large river , and up a waterfall some salmon were leaping .
How their silver sides glistened in the light , and how he longed to catch some of the great fellows !
But how could he do it ?
He had beheld no one except the old women , and it was not very likely that they would be able to help him .
So with a sigh he turned away and went back to them , but , as he walked , a thought struck him .
He pulled out one of his hairs which hung nearly to his waist , and it instantly became a strong line , nearly a mile in length .
` Weave me a net that I may catch some salmon , ' said he .
And they wove him the net he asked for , and for many weeks he watched by the river , only going back to the old women when he wanted a fish cooked .
At last , one day , when he was eating his dinner , the old woman who always spoke first , said to him : ` We have been very glad to see you , grandson , but now it is time that you went home . '
And pushing aside a rock , he saw a deep hole , so deep that he could not see to the bottom .
Then they dragged a basket out of the house , and tied a rope to it .
` Get in , and wrap this blanket round your head , ' said they ; ` and , whatever happens , do n't uncover it till you get to the bottom . '
Then they bade him farewell , and he curled himself up in the basket .
Down , down , down he went ; would he ever stop going ?
But when the basket did stop , the young man forgot what he had been told , and put his head out to see what was the matter .
In an instant the basket moved , but , to his horror , instead of going down , he felt himself being drawn upwards , and shortly after he beheld the faces of the old women .
` You will never see your wife and son if you will not do as you are bid , ' said they .
` Now get in , and do not stir till you hear a crow calling . '
This time the young man was wiser , and though the basket often stopped , and strange creatures seemed to rest on him and to pluck at his blanket , he held it tight till he heard the crow calling .
Then he flung off the blanket and sprang out , while the basket vanished in the sky .
He walked on quickly down the track that led to the hut , when , before him , he saw his wife with his little son on her back .
` Oh !
there is father at last , ' cried the boy ; but the mother bade him cease from idle talking .
` But , mother , it is true ; father is coming ! '
repeated the child .
And , to satisfy him , the woman turned round and perceived her husband .
Oh , how glad they all were to be together again !
And when the wind whistled through the forest , and the snow stood in great banks round the door , the father used to take the little boy on his knee and tell him how he caught salmon in the Land of the Sun .
How the Stalos Were Tricked -LSB- From the Journal of the Anthropological Institute . -RSB-
` Mother , I have seen such a wonderful man , ' said a little boy one day , as he entered a hut in Lapland , bearing in his arms the bundle of sticks he had been sent out to gather .
` Have you , my son ; and what was he like ? '
asked the mother , as she took off the child 's sheepskin coat and shook it on the doorstep .
` Well , I was tired of stooping for the sticks , and was leaning against a tree to rest , when I heard a noise of ` sh - ` sh , among the dead leaves .
I thought perhaps it was a wolf , so I stood very still .
But soon there came past a tall man -- oh !
twice as tall as father -- with a long red beard and a red tunic fastened with a silver girdle , from which hung a silver-handled knife .
Behind him followed a great dog , which looked stronger than any wolf , or even a bear .
But why are you so pale , mother ? '
` It was the Stalo , ' replied she , her voice trembling ; ` Stalo the man-eater !
You did well to hide , or you might never had come back .
But , remember that , though he is so tall and strong , he is very stupid , and many a Lapp has escaped from his clutches by playing him some clever trick . '
Not long after the mother and son had held this talk , it began to be whispered in the forest that the children of an old man called Patto had vanished one by one , no one knew whither .
The unhappy father searched the country for miles round without being able to find as much as a shoe or a handkerchief , to show him where they had passed , but at length a little boy came with news that he had seen the Stalo hiding behind a well , near which the children used to play .
The boy had waited behind a clump of bushes to see what would happen , and by-and-by he noticed that the Stalo had laid a cunning trap in the path to the well , and that anybody who fell over it would roll into the water and drown there .
And , as he watched , Patto 's youngest daughter ran gaily down the path , till her foot caught in the strings that were stretched across the steepest place .
She slipped and fell , and in another instant had rolled into the water within reach of the Stalo .
As soon as Patto heard this tale his heart was filled with rage , and he vowed to have his revenge .
So he straightway took an old fur coat from the hook where it hung , and putting it on went out into the forest .
When he reached the path that led to the well he looked hastily round to be sure that no one was watching him , then laid himself down as if he had been caught in the snare and had rolled into the well , though he took care to keep his head out of the water .
Very soon he heard a ` sh - ` sh of the leaves , and there was the Stalo pushing his way through the undergrowth to see what chance he had of a dinner .
At the first glimpse of Patto 's head in the well he laughed loudly , crying : ` Ha !
ha !
This time it is the old ass !
I wonder how he will taste ? '
And drawing Patto out of the well , he flung him across his shoulders and carried him home .
Then he tied a cord round him and hung him over the fire to roast , while he finished a box that he was making before the door of the hut , which he meant to hold Patto 's flesh when it was cooked .
In a very short time the box was so nearly done that it only wanted a little more chipping out with an axe ; but this part of the work was easier accomplished indoors , and he called to one of his sons who were lounging inside to bring him the tool .
The young man looked everywhere , but he could not find the axe , for the very good reason that Patto had managed to pick it up and hide it in his clothes .
` Stupid fellow !
what is the use of you ? '
grumbled his father angrily ; and he bade first one and then another of his sons to fetch him the tool , but they had no better success than their brother . '
I must come myself , I suppose ! '
said Stalo , putting aside the box .
But , meanwhile , Patto had slipped from the hook and concealed himself behind the door , so that , as Stalo stepped in , his prisoner raised the axe , and with one blow the ogre 's head was rolling on the ground .
His sons were so frightened at the sight that they all ran away .
And in this manner Patto avenged his dead children .
But though Stalo was dead , his three sons were still living , and not very far off either .
They had gone to their mother , who was tending some reindeer on the pastures , and told her that by some magic , they knew not what , their father 's head had rolled from his body , and they had been so afraid that something dreadful would happen to them that they had come to take refuge with her .
The ogress said nothing .
Long ago she had found out how stupid her sons were , so she just sent them out to milk the reindeer , while she returned to the other house to bury her husband 's body .
Now , three days ' journey from the hut on the pastures two brothers Sodno dwelt in a small cottage with their sister Lyma , who tended a large herd of reindeer while they were out hunting .
Of late it had been whispered from one to another that the three young Stalos were to be seen on the pastures , but the Sodno brothers did not disturb themselves , the danger seemed too far away .
Unluckily , however , one day , when Lyma was left by herself in the hut , the three Stalos came down and carried her and the reindeer off to their own cottage .
The country was very lonely , and perhaps no one would have known in which direction she had gone had not the girl managed to tie a ball of thread to the handle of a door at the back of the cottage and let it trail behind her .
Of course the ball was not long enough to go all the way , but it lay on the edge of a snowy track which led straight to the Stalos ' house .
When the brothers returned from their hunting they found both the hut and the sheds empty .
Loudly they cried : ` Lyma !
Lyma ! '
But no voice answered them ; and they fell to searching all about , lest perchance their sister might have dropped some clue to guide them .
At length their eyes dropped on the thread which lay on the snow , and they set out to follow it .
On and on they went , and when at length the thread stopped the brothers knew that another day 's journey would bring them to the Stalos ' dwelling .
Of course they did not dare to approach it openly , for the Stalos had the strength of giants , and besides , there were three of them ; so the two Sodnos climbed into a big bushy tree which overhung a well .
` Perhaps our sister may be sent to draw water here , ' they said to each other .
But it was not till the moon had risen that the sister came , and as she let down her bucket into the well , the leaves seemed to whisper ` Lyma !
Lyma ! '
The girl started and looked up , but could see nothing , and in a moment the voice came again .
` Be careful -- take no notice , fill your buckets , but listen carefully all the while , and we will tell you what to do so that you may escape yourself and set free the reindeer also . '
So Lyman bent over the well lower than before , and seemed busier than ever .
` You know , ' said her brother , ` that when a Stalo finds that anything has been dropped into his food he will not eat a morsel , but throws it to his dogs .
Now , after the pot has been hanging some time over the fire , and the broth is nearly cooked , just rake up the log of wood so that some of the ashes fly into the pot .
The Stalo will soon notice this , and will call you to give all the food to the dogs ; but , instead , you must bring it straight to us , as it is three days since we have eaten or drunk .
That is all you need do for the present . '
Then Lyma took up her buckets and carried them into the house , and did as her brothers had told her .
They were so hungry that they ate the food up greedily without speaking , but when there was nothing left in the pot , the eldest one said : ` Listen carefully to what I have to tell you .
After the eldest Stalo has cooked and eaten a fresh supper , he will go to bed and sleep so soundly that not even a witch could wake him .
You can hear him snoring a mile off , and then you must go into his room and pull off the iron mantle that covers him , and put it on the fire till it is almost red hot .
When that is done , come to us and we will give you further directions . ' '
I will obey you in everything , dear brothers , ' answered Lyman ; and so she did .
It had happened that on this very evening the Stalos had driven in some of the reindeer from the pasture , and had tied them up to the wall of the house so that they might be handy to kill for next day 's dinner .
The two Sodnos had seen what they were doing , and where the beasts were secured ; so , at midnight , when all was still , they crept down from their tree and seized the reindeer by the horns which were locked together .
The animals were frightened , and began to neigh and kick , as if they were fighting together , and the noise became so great that even the eldest Stalo was awakened by it , and that was a thing which had never occurred before .
Raising himself in his bed , he called to his youngest brother to go out and separate the reindeer or they would certainly kill themselves .
The young Stalo did as he was bid , and left the house ; but no sooner was he out of the door than he was stabbed to the heart by one of the Sodnos , and fell without a groan .
Then they went back to worry the reindeer , and the noise became as great as ever , and a second time the Stalo awoke .
` The boy does not seem to be able to part the beasts , ' he cried to his second brother ; ` go and help him , or I shall never get to sleep . '
So the brother went , and in an instant was struck dead as he left the house by the sword of the eldest Sodno .
The Stalo waited in bed a little longer for things to get quiet , but as the clatter of the reindeer 's horns was as bad as ever , he rose angrily from his bed muttering to himself : ` It is extraordinary that they can not unlock themselves ; but as no one else seems able to help them I suppose I must go and do it . '
Rubbing his eyes , he stood up on the floor and stretched his great arms and gave a yawn which shook the walls .
The Sodnos heard it below , and posted themselves , one at the big door and one at the little door at the back , for they did not know what their enemy would come out at .
The Stalo put out his hand to take his iron mantle from the bed , where it always lay , but the mantle was no there .
He wondered where it could be , and who could have moved it , and after searching through all the rooms , he found it hanging over the kitchen fire .
But the first touch burnt him so badly that he let it alone , and went with nothing , except a stick in his hand , through the back door .
The young Sodno was standing ready for him , and as the Stalo passed the threshold struck him such a blow on the head that he rolled over with a crash and never stirred again .
The two Sodnos did not trouble about him , but quickly stripped the younger Stalos of their clothes , in which they dressed themselves .
Then they sat still till the dawn should break and they could find out from the Stalos ' mother where the treasure was hidden .
With the first rays of the sun the young Sodno went upstairs and entered the old woman 's room .
She was already up and dressed , and sitting by the window knitting , and the young man crept in softly and crouched down on the floor , laying his head on her lap .
For a while he kept silence , then he whispered gently : ` Tell me , dear mother , where did my eldest brother conceal his riches ? '
` What a strange question !
Surely you must know , ' answered she .
` No , I have forgotten ; my memory is so bad . '
` He dug a hole under the doorstep and placed it there , ' said she .
And there was another pause .
By-and-by the Sodno asked again : ` And where may my second brother 's money be ? '
` Do n't you know that either ? '
cried the mother in surprise .
` Oh , yes ; I did once .
But since I fell upon my head I can remember nothing . '
` It is behind the oven , ' answered she .
And again was silence .
` Mother , dear mother , ' said the young man at last , ' I am almost afraid to ask you ; but I really have grown so stupid of late .
Where did I hide my own money ? '
But at this question the old woman flew into a passion , and vowed that if she could find a rod she would bring his memory back to him .
Luckily , no rod was within her reach , and the Sodno managed , after a little , to coax her back into good humour , and at length she told him that the youngest Stalo had buried his treasure under the very place where she was sitting .
` Dear mother , ' said Lyman , who had come in unseen , and was kneeling in front of the fire .
` Dear mother , do you know who it is you have been talking with ? '
The old woman started , but answered quietly : ` It is a Sodno , I suppose ? '
` You have guessed right , ' replied Lyma .
The mother of the Stalos looked round for her iron cane , which she always used to kill her victims , but it was not there , for Lyma had put it in the fire .
` Where is my iron cane ? '
asked the old woman .
` There ! '
answered Lyma , pointing to the flames .
The old woman sprang forwards and seized it , but her clothes caught fire , and in a few minutes she was burned to ashes .
So the Sodno brothers found the treasure , and they carried it , and their sister and the reindeer , to their own home , and were the richest men in all Lapland .
Andras Baive -LSB- From Lapplandische Marchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-
Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strong and swift of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could come near him if they were running races in the summer evenings .
The people of Vadso were very proud of their champion , and thought that there was no one like him in the world , till , by-and-by , it came to their ears that there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp , Andras Baive by name , who was said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than the bailiff .
Of course not a creature in Vadso believed that , and declared that if it made the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense , why , let them !
The winter was long and cold , and the thoughts of the villagers were much busier with wolves than with Andras Baive , when suddenly , on a frosty day , he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso .
The bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength , and at once went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour .
As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boat that lay upon the shore , and his face shone with pleasure .
` That is the very thing , ' laughed he , ' I will make him jump over that boat . '
Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge , and they soon settled the terms of the wager .
He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching it with his heel was to be the winner , and would get a large sum of money as the prize .
So , followed by many of the villagers , the two men walked down to the sea .
An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play , and to hold the stakes , and Andras , as the stranger was told to jump first .
Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark the starting place , he ran forward , with his head well thrown back , and cleared the boat with a mighty bound .
The lookers-on cheered him , and indeed he well deserve it ; but they waited anxiously all the same to see what the bailiff would do .
On he came , taller than Andras by several inches , but heavier of build .
He too sprang high and well , but as he came down his heel just grazed the edge of the boat .
Dead silence reigned amidst the townsfolk , but Andras only laughed and said carelessly : ` Just a little too short , bailiff ; next time you must do better than that . '
The bailiff turned red with anger at his rival 's scornful words , and answered quickly : ` Next time you will have something harder to do . '
And turning his back on his friends , he went sulkily home .
Andras , putting the money he had earned in his pocket , went home also .
The following spring Andras happened to be driving his reindeer along a great fiord to the west of Vadso .
A boy who had met him hastened to tell the bailiff that his enemy was only a few miles off ; and the bailiff , disguising himself as a Stalo , or ogre , called his son and his dog and rowed away across the fiord to the place where the boy had met Andras .
Now the mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands , thinking of the new hut that he was building with the money that he had won on the day of his lucky jump .
He wandered on , his eyes fixed on the sands , so that he did not see the bailiff drive his boat behind a rock , while he changed himself into a heap of wreckage which floated in on the waves .
A stumble over a stone recalled Andras to himself , and looking up he beheld the mass of wreckage .
` Dear me !
I may find some use for that , ' he said ; and hastened down to the sea , waiting till he could lay hold of some stray rope which might float towards him .
Suddenly -- he could not have told why -- a nameless fear seized upon him , and he fled away from the shore as if for his life .
As he ran he heard the sound of a pipe , such as only ogres of the Stalo kind were wont to use ; and there flashed into his mind what the bailiff had said when they jumped the boat : ` Next time you will have something harder to do . '
So it was no wreckage after all that he had seen , but the bailiff himself .
It happened that in the long summer nights up in the mountain , where the sun never set , and it was very difficult to get to sleep , Andras had spent many hours in the study of magic , and this stood him in good stead now .
The instant he heard the Stalo music he wished himself to become the feet of a reindeer , and in this guise he galloped like the wind for several miles .
Then he stopped to take breath and find out what his enemy was doing .
Nothing he could see , but to his ears the notes of a pipe floated over the plain , and ever , as he listened , it drew nearer .
A cold shiver shook Andras , and this time he wished himself the feet of a reindeer calf .
For when a reindeer calf has reached the age at which he begins first to lose his hair he is so swift that neither beast nor bird can come near him .
A reindeer calf is the swiftest of all things living .
Yes ; but not so swift as a Stalo , as Andras found out when he stopped to rest , and heard the pipe playing !
For a moment his heart sank , and he gave himself up for dead , till he remembered that , not far off , were two little lakes joined together by a short though very broad river .
In the middle of the river lay a stone that was always covered by water , except in dry seasons , and as the winter rains had been very heavy , he felt quite sure that not even the top of it could be seen .
The next minute , if anyone had been looking that way , he would have beheld a small reindeer calf speeding northwards , and by-and-by giving a great spring , which landed him in the midst of the stream .
But , instead of sinking to the bottom , he paused a second to steady himself , then gave a second spring which landed him on the further shore .
He next ran on to a little hill where he saw down and began to neigh loudly , so that the Stalo might know exactly where he was .
` Ah !
There you are , ' cried the Stalo , appearing on the opposite bank ; ` for a moment I really thought I had lost you . '
` No such luck , ' answered Andras , shaking his head sorrowfully .
By this time he had taken his own shape again .
` Well , but I do n't see how I am to get to you , ' said the Stalo , looking up and down .
` Jump over , as I did , ' answered Andras ; ` it is quite easy . '
` But I could not jump this river ; and I do n't know how you did , ' replied the Stalo . '
I should be ashamed to say such things , ' exclaimed Andras .
` Do you mean to tell me that a jump , which the weakest Lapp boy would make nothing of , is beyond your strength ? '
The Stalo grew red and angry when he heard these words , just as Andras meant him to do .
He bounded into the air and fell straight into the river .
Not that that would have mattered , for he was a good swimmer ; but Andras drew out the bow and arrows which every Lapp carries , and took aim at him .
His aim was good , but the Stalo sprang so high into the air that the arrow flew between his feet .
A second shot , directed at his forehead , fared no better , for this time the Stalo jumped so high to the other side that the arrow passed between his finger and thumb .
Then Andras aimed his third arrow a little over the Stalo 's head , and when he sprang up , just an instant too soon , it hit him between the ribs .
Mortally wounded as he was , the Stalo was not yet dead , and managed to swim to the shore .
Stretching himself on the sand , he said slowly to Andras : ` Promise that you will give me an honourable burial , and when my body is laid in the grave go in my boat across the fiord , and take whatever you find in my house which belongs to me .
My dog you must kill , but spare my son , Andras . '
Then he died ; and Andras sailed in his boat away across the fiord and found the dog and boy .
The dog , a fierce , wicked-looking creature , he slew with one blow from his fist , for it is well known that if a Stalo 's dog licks the blood that flows from his dead master 's wounds the Stalo comes to life again .
That is why no REAL Stalo is ever seen without his dog ; but the bailiff , being only half a Stalo , had forgotten him , when he went to the little lakes in search of Andras .
Next , Andras put all the gold and jewels which he found in the boat into his pockets , and bidding the boy get in , pushed it off from the shore , leaving the little craft to drift as it would , while he himself ran home .
With the treasure he possessed he was able to buy a great herd of reindeer ; and he soon married a rich wife , whose parents would not have him as a son-in-law when he was poor , and the two lived happy for ever after .
The White Slipper -LSB- From Lapplandische Mahrchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-
Once upon a time there lived a king who had a daughter just fifteen years old .
And what a daughter !
Even the mothers who had daughters of their own could not help allowing that the princess was much more beautiful and graceful than any of them ; and , as for the fathers , if one of them ever beheld her by accident he could talk of nothing else for a whole day afterwards .
Of course the king , whose name was Balancin , was the complete slave of his little girl from the moment he lifted her from the arms of her dead mother ; indeed , he did not seem to know that there was anyone else in the world to love .
Now Diamantina , for that was her name , did not reach her fifteenth birthday without proposals for marriage from every country under heaven ; but be the suitor who he might , the king always said him nay .
Behind the palace a large garden stretched away to the foot of some hills , and more than one river flowed through .
Hither the princess would come each evening towards sunset , attended by her ladies , and gather herself the flowers that were to adorn her rooms .
She also brought with her a pair of scissors to cut off the dead blooms , and a basket to put them in , so that when the sun rose next morning he might see nothing unsightly .
When she had finished this task she would take a walk through the town , so that the poor people might have a chance of speaking with her , and telling her of their troubles ; and then she would seek out her father , and together they would consult over the best means of giving help to those who needed it .
But what has all this to do with the White Slipper ?
my readers will ask .
Have patience , and you will see .
Next to his daughter , Balancin loved hunting , and it was his custom to spend several mornings every week chasing the boars which abounded in the mountains a few miles from the city .
One day , rushing downhill as fast as he could go , he put his foot into a hole and fell , rolling into a rocky pit of brambles .
The king 's wounds were not very severe , but his face and hands were cut and torn , while his feet were in a worse plight still , for , instead of proper hunting boots , he only wore sandals , to enable him to run more swiftly .
In a few days the king was as well as ever , and the signs of the scratches were almost gone ; but one foot still remained very sore , where a thorn had pierced deeply and had festered .
The best doctors in the kingdom treated it with all their skill ; they bathed , and poulticed , and bandaged , but it was in vain .
The foot only grew worse and worse , and became daily more swollen and painful .
After everyone had tried his own particular cure , and found it fail , there came news of a wonderful doctor in some distant land who had healed the most astonishing diseases .
On inquiring , it was found that he never left the walls of his own city , and expected his patients to come to see him ; but , by dint of offering a large sum of money , the king persuaded the famous physician to undertake the journey to his own court .
On his arrival the doctor was led at once into the king 's presence , and made a careful examination of his foot .
` Alas !
your majesty , ' he said , when he had finished , ` the wound is beyond the power of man to heal ; but though I can not cure it , I can at least deaden the pain , and enable you to walk without so much suffering . '
` Oh , if you can only do that , ' cried the king , ' I shall be grateful to you for life !
Give your own orders ; they shall be obeyed . '
` Then let your majesty bid the royal shoemaker make you a shoe of goat-skin very loose and comfortable , while I prepare a varnish to paint over it of which I alone have the secret ! '
So saying , the doctor bowed himself out , leaving the king more cheerful and hopeful than he had been for long .
The days passed very slowly with him during the making of the shoe and the preparation of the varnish , but on the eighth morning the physician appeared , bringing with him the shoe in a case .
He drew it out to slip on the king 's foot , and over the goat-skin he had rubbed a polish so white that the snow itself was not more dazzling .
` While you wear this shoe you will not feel the slightest pain , ' said the doctor .
` For the balsam with which I have rubbed it inside and out has , besides its healing balm , the quality of strengthening the material it touches , so that , even were your majesty to live a thousand years , you would find the slipper just as fresh at the end of that time as it is now . '
The king was so eager to put it on that he hardly gave the physician time to finish .
He snatched it from the case and thrust his foot into it , nearly weeping for joy when he found he could walk and run as easily as any beggar boy .
` What can I give you ? '
he cried , holding out both hands to the man who had worked this wonder .
` Stay with me , and I will heap on you riches greater than ever you dreamed of . '
But the doctor said he would accept nothing more than had been agreed on , and must return at once to his own country , where many sick people were awaiting him .
So king Balancin had to content himself with ordering the physician to be treated with royal honours , and desiring that an escort should attend him on his journey home .
For two years everything went smoothly at court , and to king Balancin and his daughter the sun no sooner rose than it seemed time for it to set .
Now , the king 's birthday fell in the month of June , and as the weather happened to be unusually fine , he told the princess to celebrate it in any way that pleased her .
Diamantina was very fond of being on the river , and she was delighted at this chance of delighting her tastes .
She would have a merry-making such as never had been seen before , and in the evening , when they were tired of sailing and rowing , there should be music and dancing , plays and fireworks .
At the very end , before the people went home , every poor person should be given a loaf of bread and every girl who was to be married within the year a new dress .
The great day appeared to Diamantina to be long in coming , but , like other days , it came at last .
Before the sun was fairly up in the heavens the princess , too full of excitement to stay in the palace , was walking about the streets so covered with precious stones that you had to shade your eyes before you could look at her .
By-and-by a trumpet sounded , and she hurried home , only to appear again in a few moments walking by the side of her father down to the river .
Here a splendid barge was waiting for them , and from it they watched all sorts of races and feats of swimming and diving .
When these were over the barge proceeded up the river to the field where the dancing and concerts were to take place , and after the prizes had been given away to the winners , and the loaves and the dresses had been distributed by the princess , they bade farewell to their guests , and turned to step into the barge which was to carry them back to the palace .
Then a dreadful thing happened .
As the king stepped on board the boat one of the sandals of the white slipper , which had got loose , caught in a nail that was sticking out , and caused the king to stumble .
The pain was great , and unconsciously he turned and shook his foot , so that the sandals gave way , and in a moment the precious shoe was in the river .
It had all occurred so quickly that nobody had noticed the loss of the slipper , not even the princess , whom the king 's cries speedily brought to his side .
` What is the matter , dear father ? '
asked she .
But the king could not tell her ; and only managed to gasp out : ` My shoe !
my shoe ! '
While the sailors stood round staring , thinking that his majesty had suddenly gone mad .
Seeing her father 's eyes fixed on the stream , Diamantina looked hastily in that direction .
There , dancing on the current , was the point of something white , which became more and more distant the longer they watched it .
The king could bear the sight no more , and , besides , now that the healing ointment in the shoe had been removed the pain in his foot was as bad as ever ; he gave a sudden cry , staggered , and fell over the bulwarks into the water .
In an instant the river was covered with bobbing heads all swimming their fastest towards the king , who had been carried far down by the swift current .
At length one swimmer , stronger than the rest , seized hold of his tunic , and drew him to the bank , where a thousand eager hands were ready to haul him out .
He was carried , unconscious , to the side of his daughter , who had fainted with terror on seeing her father disappear below the surface , and together they were place in a coach and driven to the palace , where the best doctors in the city were awaiting their arrival .
In a few hours the princess was as well as ever ; but the pain , the wetting , and the shock of the accident , all told severely on the king , and for three days he lay in a high fever .
Meanwhile , his daughter , herself nearly mad with grief , gave orders that the white slipper should be sought for far and wide ; and so it was , but even the cleverest divers could find no trace of it at the bottom of the river .
When it became clear that the slipper must have been carried out to sea by the current , Diamantina turned her thoughts elsewhere , and sent messengers in search of the doctor who had brought relief to her father , begging him to make another slipper as fast as possible , to supply the place of the one which was lost .
But the messengers returned with the sad news that the doctor had died some weeks before , and , what was worse , his secret had died with him .
In his weakness this intelligence had such an effect on the king that the physicians feared he would become as ill as before .
He could hardly be persuaded to touch food , and all night long he lay moaning , partly with pain , and partly over his own folly in not having begged the doctor to make him several dozens of white slippers , so that in case of accidents he might always have one to put on .
However , by-and-by he saw that it was no use weeping and wailing , and commanded that they should search for his lost treasure more diligently than ever .
What a sight the river banks presented in those days !
It seemed as if all the people in the country were gathered on them .
But this second search was no more fortunate than the first , and at last the king issued a proclamation that whoever found the missing slipper should be made heir to the crown , and should marry the princess .
Now many daughters would have rebelled at being disposed of in the manner ; and it must be admitted that Diamantina 's heart sank when she heard what the king had done .
Still , she loved her father so much that she desired his comfort more than anything else in the world , so she said nothing , and only bowed her head .
Of course the result of the proclamation was that the river banks became more crowded than before ; for all the princess 's suitors from distant lands flocked to the spot , each hoping that he might be the lucky finder .
Many times a shining stone at the bottom of the stream was taken for the slipper itself , and every evening saw a band of dripping downcast men returning homewards .
But one youth always lingered longer than the rest , and night would still see him engaged in the search , though his clothes stuck to his skin and his teeth chattered .
One day , when the king was lying on his bed racked with pain , he heard the noise of a scuffle going on in his antechamber , and rang a golden bell that stood by his side to summon one of his servants .
` Sire , ' answered the attendant , when the king inquired what was the matter , ` the noise you heard was caused by a young man from the town , who has had the impudence to come here to ask if he may measure your majesty 's foot , so as to make you another slipper in place of the lost one . '
` And what have you done to the youth ? '
said the king .
` The servants pushed him out of the palace , and , added a few blows to teach him not to be insolent , ' replied the man .
` Then they did very ill , ' answered the king , with a frown .
` He came here from kindness , and there was no reason to maltreat him . '
` Oh , my lord , he had the audacity to wish to touch your majesty 's sacred person -- he , a good-for-nothing boy , a mere shoemaker 's apprentice , perhaps !
And even if he could make shoes to perfection they would be no use without the soothing balsam . '
The king remained silent for a few moments , then he said : ` Never mind .
Go and fetch the youth and bring him to me .
I would gladly try any remedy that may relieve my pain . '
So , soon afterwards , the youth , who had not gone far from the palace , was caught and ushered into the king 's presence .
He was tall and handsome and , though he professed to make shoes , his manners were good and modest , and he bowed low as he begged the king not only to allow him to take the measure of his foot , but also to suffer him to place a healing plaster over the wound .
Balancin was pleased with the young man 's voice and appearance , and thought that he looked as if he knew what he was doing .
So he stretched out his bad foot which the youth examined with great attention , and then gently laid on the plaster .
Very shortly the ointment began to soothe the sharp pain , and the king , whose confidence increased every moment , begged the young man to tell him his name . '
I have no parents ; they died when I was six , sire , ' replied the youth , modestly .
` Everyone in the town calls me Gilguerillo , because , when I was little , I went singing through the world in spite of my misfortunes .
Luckily for me I was born to be happy . '
` And you really think you can cure me ? '
asked the king .
` Completely , my lord , ' answered Gilguerillo .
` And how long do you think it will take ? '
` It is not an easy task ; but I will try to finish it in a fortnight , ' replied the youth .
A fortnight seemed to the king a long time to make one slipper .
But he only said : ` Do you need anything to help you ? '
` Only a good horse , if your majesty will be kind enough to give me one , ' answered Gilguerillo .
And the reply was so unexpected that the courtiers could hardly restrain their smiles , while the king stared silently .
` You shall have the horse , ' he said at last , ` and I shall expect you back in a fortnight .
If you fulfil your promise you know your reward ; if not , I will have you flogged for your impudence . '
Gilguerillo bowed , and turned to leave the palace , followed by the jeers and scoffs of everyone he met .
But he paid no heed , for he had got what he wanted .
He waited in front of the gates till a magnificent horse was led up to him , and vaulting into the saddle with an ease which rather surprised the attendant , rode quickly out of the town amidst the jests of the assembled crowd , who had heard of his audacious proposal .
And while he is on his way let us pause for a moment and tell who he is .
Both father and mother had died before the boy was six years old ; and he had lived for many years with his uncle , whose life had been passed in the study of chemistry .
He could leave no money to his nephew , as he had a son of his own ; but he taught him all he knew , and at his dead Gilguerillo entered an office , where he worked for many hours daily .
In his spare time , instead of playing with the other boys , he passed hours poring over books , and because he was timid and liked to be alone he was held by everyone to be a little mad .
Therefore , when it became known that he had promised to cure the king 's foot , and had ridden away -- no one knew where -- a roar of laughter and mockery rang through the town , and jeers and scoffing words were sent after him .
But if they had only known what were Gilguerillo 's thoughts they would have thought him madder than ever .
The real truth was that , on the morning when the princess had walked through the streets before making holiday on the river Gilguerillo had seen her from his window , and had straightway fallen in love with her .
Of course he felt quite hopeless .
It was absurd to imagine that the apothecary 's nephew could ever marry the king 's daughter ; so he did his best to forget her , and study harder than before , till the royal proclamation suddenly filled him with hope .
When he was free he no longer spent the precious moments poring over books , but , like the rest , he might have been seen wandering along the banks of the river , or diving into the stream after something that lay glistening in the clear water , but which turned out to be a white pebble or a bit of glass .
And at the end he understood that it was not by the river that he would win the princess ; and , turning to his books for comfort , he studied harder than ever .
There is an old proverb which says : ` Everything comes to him who knows how to wait . '
It is not all men who know hot to wait , any more than it is all men who can learn by experience ; but Gilguerillo was one of the few and instead of thinking his life wasted because he could not have the thing he wanted most , he tried to busy himself in other directions .
So , one day , when he expected it least , his reward came to him .
He happened to be reading a book many hundreds of years old , which told of remedies for all kinds of diseases .
Most of them , he knew , were merely invented by old women , who sought to prove themselves wiser than other people ; but at length he came to something which caused him to sit up straight in his chair , and made his eyes brighten .
This was the description of a balsam -- which would cure every kind of sore or wound -- distilled from a plant only to be found in a country so distant that it would take a man on foot two months to go and come back again .
When I say that the book declared that the balsam could heal every sort of sore or wound , there were a few against which it was powerless , and it gave certain signs by which these might be known .
This was the reason why Gilguerillo demanded to see the king 's foot before he would undertake to cure it ; and to obtain admittance he gave out that he was a shoemaker .
However , the dreaded signs were absent , and his heart bounded at the thought that the princess was within his reach .
Perhaps she was ; but a great deal had to be accomplished yet , and he had allowed himself a very short time in which to do it .
He spared his horse only so much as was needful , yet it took him six days to reach the spot where the plant grew .
A thick wood lay in front of him , and , fastening the bridle tightly to a tree , he flung himself on his hands and knees and began to hunt for the treasure .
Many time he fancied it was close to him , and many times it turned out to be something else ; but , at last , when light was fading , and he had almost given up hope , he came upon a large bed of the plant , right under his feet !
Trembling with joy , he picked every scrap he could see , and placed it in his wallet .
Then , mounting his horse , he galloped quickly back towards the city .
It was night when he entered the gates , and the fifteen days allotted were not up till the next day .
His eyes were heavy with sleep , and his body ached with the long strain , but , without pausing to rest , he kindled a fire on is hearth , and quickly filling a pot with water , threw in the herbs and left them to boil .
After that he lay down and slept soundly .
The sun was shining when he awoke , and he jumped up and ran to the pot .
The plant had disappeared and in its stead was a thick syrup , just as the book had said there would be .
He lifted the syrup out with a spoon , and after spreading it in the sun till it was partly dry , poured it into a small flask of crystal .
He next washed himself thoroughly , and dressed himself , in his best clothes , and putting the flask in his pocket , set out for the palace , and begged to see the king without delay .
Now Balancin , whose foot had been much less painful since Gilguerillo had wrapped it in the plaster , was counting the days to the young man 's return ; and when he was told Gilguerillo was there , ordered him to be admitted at once .
As he entered , the king raised himself eagerly on his pillows , but his face fell when he saw no signs of a slipper .
` You have failed , then ? '
he said , throwing up his hands in despair . '
I hope not , your majesty ; I think not , ' answered the youth .
And drawing the flask from his pocket , he poured two or three drops on the wound .
` Repeat this for three nights , and you will find yourself cured , ' said he .
And before the king had time to thank him he had bowed himself out .
Of course the news soon spread through the city , and men and women never tired of calling Gilguerillo an impostor , and prophesying that the end of the three days would see him in prison , if not on the scaffold .
But Gilguerillo paid no heed to their hard words , and no more did the king , who took care that no hand but his own should put on the healing balsam .
On the fourth morning the king awoke and instantly stretched out his wounded foot that he might prove the truth or falsehood of Gilguerillo 's remedy .
The wound was certainly cured on that side , but how about the other ?
Yes , that was cured also ; and not even a scar was left to show where it had been !
Was ever any king so happy as Balancin when he satisfied himself of this ?
Lightly as a deer he jumped from his bed , and began to turn head over heels and to perform all sorts of antics , so as to make sure that his foot was in truth as well as it looked .
And when he was quite tired he sent for his daughter , and bade the courtiers bring the lucky young man to his room .
` He is really young and handsome , ' said the princess to herself , heaving a sigh of relief that it was not some dreadful old man who had healed her father ; and while the king was announcing to his courtiers the wonderful cure that had been made , Diamantina was thinking that if Gilguerillo looked so well in his common dress , how much improved by the splendid garments of a king ' son .
However , she held her peace , and only watched with amusement when the courtiers , knowing there was no help for it , did homage and obeisance to the chemist 's boy .
Then they brought to Gilguerillo a magnificent tunic of green velvet bordered with gold , and a cap with three white plumes stuck in it ; and at the sight of him so arrayed , the princess fell in love with him in a moment .
The wedding was fixed to take place in eight days , and at the ball afterwards nobody danced so long or so lightly as king Balancin .

There was once an old couple named Peder and Kirsten who had an only son called Hans .
From the time he was a little boy he had been told that on his sixteenth birthday he must go out into the world and serve his apprenticeship .
So , one fine summer morning , he started off to seek his fortune with nothing but the clothes he wore on his back .
For many hours he trudged on merrily , now and then stopping to drink from some clear spring or to pick some ripe fruit from a tree .
The little wild creatures peeped at him from beneath the bushes , and he nodded and smiled , and wished them ` Good-morning . '
After he had been walking for some time he met an old white-bearded man who was coming along the footpath .
The boy would not step aside , and the man was determined not to do so either , so they ran against one another with a bump .
` It seems to me , ' said the old fellow , ` that a boy should give way to an old man . '
` The path is for me as well as for you , ' answered young Hans saucily , for he had never been taught politeness .
` Well , that 's true enough , ' answered the other mildly .
` And where are you going ? ' '
I am going into service , ' said Hans .
` Then you can come and serve me , ' replied the man .
Well , Hans could do that ; but what would his wages be ?
` Two pounds a year , and nothing to do but keep some rooms clean , ' said the new-comer .
This seemed to Hans to be easy enough ; so he agreed to enter the old man 's service , and they set out together .
On their way they crossed a deep valley and came to a mountain , where the man opened a trapdoor , and bidding Hans follow him , he crept in and began to go down a long flight of steps .
When they got to the bottom Hans saw a large number of rooms lit by many lamps and full of beautiful things .
While he was looking round the old man said to him : ` Now you know what you have to do .
You must keep these rooms clean , and strew sand on the floor every day .
Here is a table where you will always find food and drink , and there is your bed .
You see there are a great many suits of clothes hanging on the wall , and you may wear any you please ; but remember that you are never to open this locked door .
If you do ill will befall you .
Farewell , for I am going away again and can not tell when I may return .
No sooner had the old man disappeared than Hans sat down to a good meal , and after that went to bed and slept until the morning .
At first he could not remember what had happened to him , but by-and-by he jumped up and went into all the rooms , which he examined carefully .
` How foolish to bid me to put sand on the floors , ' he thought , ` when there is nobody here by myself !
I shall do nothing of the sort . '
And so he shut the doors quickly , and only cleaned and set in order his own room .
And after the first few days he felt that that was unnecessary too , because no one came there to see if the rooms where clean or not .
At last he did no work at all , but just sat and wondered what was behind the locked door , till he determined to go and look for himself .
The key turned easily in the lock .
Hans entered , half frightened at what he was doing , and the first thing he beheld was a heap of bones .
That was not very cheerful ; and he was just going out again when his eye fell on a shelf of books .
Here was a good way of passing the time , he thought , for he was fond of reading , and he took one of the books from the shelf .
It was all about magic , and told you how you could change yourself into anything in the world you liked .
Could anything be more exciting or more useful ?
So he put it in his pocket , and ran quickly away out of the mountain by a little door which had been left open .
When he got home his parents asked him what he had been doing and where he had got the fine clothes he wore .
` Oh , I earned them myself , ' answered he .
` You never earned them in this short time , ' said his father .
` Be off with you ; I wo n't keep you here .
I will have no thieves in my house ! '
` Well I only came to help you , ' replied the boy sulkily .
` Now I 'll be off , as you wish ; but to-morrow morning when you rise you will see a great dog at the door .
Do not drive it away , but take it to the castle and sell it to the duke , and they will give you ten dollars for it ; only you must bring the strap you lead it with , back to the house . '
Sure enough the next day the dog was standing at the door waiting to be let in .
The old man was rather afraid of getting into trouble , but his wife urged him to sell the dog as the boy had bidden him , so he took it up to the castle and sold it to the duke for ten dollars .
But he did not forget to take off the strap with which he had led the animal , and to carry it home .
When he got there old Kirsten met him at the door .
` Well , Peder , and have you sold the dog ? '
asked she .
` Yes , Kirsten ; and I have brought back ten dollars , as the boy told us , ' answered Peder .
` Ay !
but that 's fine ! '
said his wife .
` Now you see what one gets by doing as one is bid ; if it had not been for me you would have driven the dog away again , and we should have lost the money .
After all , I always know what is best . '
` Nonsense ! '
said her husband ; ` women always think they know best .
I should have sold the dog just the same whatever you had told me .
Put the money away in a safe place , and do n't talk so much . '
The next day Hans came again ; but though everything had turned out as he had foretold , he found that his father was still not quite satisfied .
` Be off with you ! '
said he , ` you 'll get us into trouble . ' '
I have n't helped you enough yet , ' replied the boy .
` To-morrow there will come a great fat cow , as big as the house .
Take it to the king 's palace and you 'll get as much as a thousand dollars for it .
Only you must unfasten the halter you lead it with and bring it back , and do n't return by the high road , but through the forest . '
The next day , when the couple rose , they saw an enormous head looking in at their bedroom window , and behind it was a cow which was nearly as big as their hut .
Kirsten was wild with joy to think of the money the cow would bring them .
` But how are you going to put the rope over her head ? '
asked she .
` Wait and you 'll see , mother , ' answered her husband .
Then Peder took the ladder that led up to the hayloft and set it against the cow 's neck , and he climbed up and slipped the rope over her head .
When he had made sure that the noose was fast they started for the palace , and met the king himself walking in his grounds . '
I heard that the princess was going to be married , ' said Peder , ` so I 've brought your majesty a cow which is bigger than any cow that was ever seen .
Will your majesty deign to buy it ? '
The king had , in truth , never seen so large a beast , and he willingly paid the thousand dollars , which was the price demanded ; but Peder remembered to take off the halter before he left .
After he was gone the king sent for the butcher and told him to kill the animal for the wedding feast .
The butcher got ready his pole-axe ; but just as he was going to strike , the cow changed itself into a dove and flew away , and the butcher stood staring after it as if he were turned to stone .
However , as the dove could not be found , he was obliged to tell the king what had happened , and the king in his turn despatched messengers to capture the old man and bring him back .
But Peder was safe in the woods , and could not be found .
When at last he felt the danger was over , and he might go home , Kirsten nearly fainted with joy at the sight of all the money he brought with him .
` Now that we are rich people we must build a bigger house , ' cried she ; and was vexed to find that Peder only shook his head and said : ` No ; if they did that people would talk , and say they had got their wealth by ill-doing . '
A few mornings later Hans came again .
` Be off before you get us into trouble , ' said his father .
` So far the money has come right enough , but I do n't trust it . '
` Do n't worry over that , father , ' said Hans .
` To-morrow you will find a horse outside by the gate .
Ride it to market and you will get a thousand dollars for it .
Only do n't forget to loosen the bridle when you sell it . '
Well , in the morning there was the horse ; Kirsten had never seen so find an animal .
` Take care it does n't hurt you , Peder , ' said she .
` Nonsense , wife , ' answered he crossly .
` When I was a lad I lived with horses , and could ride anything for twenty miles round . '
But that was not quite the truth , for he had never mounted a horse in his life .
Still , the animal was quiet enough , so Peder got safely to market on its back .
There he met a man who offered nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars for it , but Peder would take nothing less than a thousand .
At last there came an old , grey-bearded man who looked at the horse and agreed to buy it ; but the moment he touched it the horse began to kick and plunge . '
I must take the bridle off , ' said Peder .
` It is not to be sold with the animal as is usually the case . '
` I 'll give you a hundred dollars for the bridle , ' said the old man , taking out his purse .
` No , I ca n't sell it , ' replied Hans 's father .
` Five hundred dollars ! '
` No . ' '
A thousand ! '
At this splendid offer Peder 's prudence gave way ; it was a shame to let so much money go .
So he agreed to accept it .
But he could hardly hold the horse , it became so unmanageable .
So he gave the animal in charge to the old man , and went home with his two thousand dollars .
Kirsten , of course , was delighted at this new piece of good fortune , and insisted that the new house should be built and land bought .
This time Peder consented , and soon they had quite a fine farm .
Meanwhile the old man rode off on his new purchase , and when he came to a smithy he asked the smith to forge shoes for the horse .
The smith proposed that they should first have a drink together , and the horse was tied up by the spring whilst they went indoors .
The day was hot , and both men were thirsty , and , besides , they had much to say ; and so the hours slipped by and found them still talking .
Then the servant girl came out to fetch a pail of water , and , being a kind-hearted lass , she gave some to the horse to drink .
What was her surprise when the animal said to her : ` Take off my bridle and you will save my life . ' '
I dare not , ' said she ; ` your master will be so angry . '
` He can not hurt you , ' answered the horse , ` and you will save my life . '
At that she took off the bridle ; but nearly fainted with astonishment when the horse turned into a dove and flew away just as the old man came out of the house .
Directly he saw what had happened he changed himself into a hawk and flew after the dove .
Over the woods and fields they went , and at length they reached a king 's palace surrounded by beautiful gardens .
The princess was walking with her attendants in the rose garden when the dove turned itself into a gold ring and fell at her feet .
` Why , here is a ring ! '
she cried , ` where could it have come from ? '
And picking it up she put it on her finger .
As she did so the hill-man lost his power over Hans -- for of course you understand that it was he who had been the dog , the cow , the horse and the dove .
` Well , that is really strange , ' said the princess .
` It fits me as though it had been made for me ! '
Just at that moment up came the king .
` Look at what I have found ! '
cried his daughter .
` Well , that is not worth much , my dear , ' said he .
` Besides , you have rings enough , I should think . '
` Never mind , I like it , ' replied the princess .
But as soon as she was alone , to her amazement , the ring suddenly left her finger and became a man .
You can imagine how frightened she was , as , indeed , anybody would have been ; but in an instant the man became a ring again , and then turned back to a man , and so it went on for some time until she began to get used to these sudden changes . '
I am sorry I frightened you , ' said Hans , when he thought he could safely speak to the princess without making her scream . '
I took refuge with you because the old hill-man , whom I have offended , was trying to kill me , and here I am safe . '
` You had better stay here then , ' said the princess .
So Hans stayed , and he and she became good friends ; though , of course , he only became a man when no one else was present .
This was all very well ; but , one day , as they were talking together , the king happened to enter the room , and although Hans quickly changed himself into a ring again it was too late .
The king was terribly angry .
` So this is why you have refused to marry all the kings and princes who have sought your hand ? '
he cried .
And , without waiting for her to speak , he commanded that his daughter should be walled up in the summer-house and starved to death with her lover .
That evening the poor princess , still wearing her ring , was put into the summer-house with enough food to last for three days , and the door was bricked up .
But at the end of a week or two the king thought it was time to give her a grand funeral , in spite of her bad behaviour , and he had the summer-house opened .
He could hardly believe his eyes when he found that the princess was not there , nor Hans either .
Instead , there lay at his feet a large hole , big enough for two people to pass through .
Now what had happened was this .
When the princess and Hans had given up hope , and cast themselves down on the ground to die , they fell down this hole , and right through the earth as well , and at last they tumbled into a castle built of pure gold at the other side of the world , and there they lived happily .
But of this , of course , the king knew nothing .
` Will anyone go down and see where the passage leads to ? '
he asked , turning to his guards and courtiers . '
I will reward splendidly the man who is brave enough to explore it . '
For a long time nobody answered .
The hole was dark and deep , and if it had a bottom no one could see it .
At length a soldier , who was a careless sort of fellow , offered himself for the service , and cautiously lowered himself into the darkness .
But in a moment he , too , fell down , down , down .
Was he going to fall for ever , he wondered !
Oh , how thankful he was in the end to reach the castle , and to meet the princess and Hans , looking quite well and not at all as if they had been starved .
They began to talk , and the soldier told them that the king was very sorry for the way he had treated his daughter , and wished day and night that he could have her back again .
Then they all took ship and sailed home , and when they came to the princess 's country , Hans disguised himself as the sovereign of a neighbouring kingdom , and went up to the palace alone .
He was given a hearty welcome by the king , who prided himself on his hospitality , and a banquet was commanded in his honour .
That evening , whilst they sat drinking their wine , Hans said to the king : ' I have heard the fame of your majesty 's wisdom , and I have travelled from far to ask your counsel .
A man in my country has buried his daughter alive because she loved a youth who was born a peasant .
How shall I punish this unnatural father , for it is left to me to give judgment ? '
The king , who was still truly grieved for his daughter 's loss , answered quickly : ` Burn him alive , and strew his ashes all over the kingdom . '
Hans looked at him steadily for a moment , and then threw off his disguise .
` You are the man , ' said he ; ` and I am he who loved your daughter , and became a gold ring on her finger .
She is safe , and waiting not far from here ; but you have pronounced judgment on yourself . '
Then the king fell on his knees and begged for mercy ; and as he had in other respects been a good father , they forgave him .
The wedding of Hans and the princess was celebrated with great festivities which lasted a month .
As for the hill-man he intended to be present ; but whilst he was walking along a street which led to the palace a loose stone fell on his head and killed him .

The Cat 's Elopement -LSB- From the Japanische Marchen und Sagen , von David Brauns -LRB- Leipzig : Wilhelm Friedrich -RRB- . -RSB-
Once upon a time there lived a cat of marvellous beauty , with a skin as soft and shining as silk , and wise green eyes , that could see even in the dark .
His name was Gon , and he belonged to a music teacher , who was so fond and proud of him that he would not have parted with him for anything in the world .
Now not far from the music master 's house there dwelt a lady who possessed a most lovely little pussy cat called Koma .
She was such a little dear altogether , and blinked her eyes so daintily , and ate her supper so tidily , and when she had finished she licked her pink nose so delicately with her little tongue , that her mistress was never tired of saying , ` Koma , Koma , what should I do without you ? '
Well , it happened one day that these two , when out for an evening stroll , met under a cherry tree , and in one moment fell madly in love with each other .
Gon had long felt that it was time for him to find a wife , for all the ladies in the neighbourhood paid him so much attention that it made him quite shy ; but he was not easy to please , and did not care about any of them .
Now , before he had time to think , Cupid had entangled him in his net , and he was filled with love towards Koma .
She fully returned his passion , but , like a woman , she saw the difficulties in the way , and consulted sadly with Gon as to the means of overcoming them .
Gon entreated his master to set matters right by buying Koma , but her mistress would not part from her .
Then the music master was asked to sell Gon to the lady , but he declined to listen to any such suggestion , so everything remained as before .
At length the love of the couple grew to such a pitch that they determined to please themselves , and to seek their fortunes together .
So one moonlight night they stole away , and ventured out into an unknown world .
All day long they marched bravely on through the sunshine , till they had left their homes far behind them , and towards evening they found themselves in a large park .
The wanderers by this time were very hot and tired , and the grass looked very soft and inviting , and the trees cast cool deep shadows , when suddenly an ogre appeared in this Paradise , in the shape of a big , big dog !
He came springing towards them showing all his teeth , and Koma shrieked , and rushed up a cherry tree .
Gon , however , stood his ground boldly , and prepared to give battle , for he felt that Koma 's eyes were upon him , and that he must not run away .
But , alas !
his courage would have availed him nothing had his enemy once touched him , for he was large and powerful , and very fierce .
From her perch in the tree Koma saw it all , and screamed with all her might , hoping that some one would hear , and come to help .
Luckily a servant of the princess to whom the park belonged was walking by , and he drove off the dog , and picking up the trembling Gon in his arms , carried him to his mistress .
So poor little Koma was left alone , while Gon was borne away full of trouble , not in the least knowing what to do .
Even the attention paid him by the princess , who was delighted with his beauty and pretty ways , did not console him , but there was no use in fighting against fate , and he could only wait and see what would turn up .
The princess , Gon 's new mistress , was so good and kind that everybody loved her , and she would have led a happy life , had it not been for a serpent who had fallen in love with her , and was constantly annoying her by his presence .
Her servants had orders to drive him away as often as he appeared ; but as they were careless , and the serpent very sly , it sometimes happened that he was able to slip past them , and to frighten the princess by appearing before her .
One day she was seated in her room , playing on her favourite musical instrument , when she felt something gliding up her sash , and saw her enemy making his way to kiss her cheek .
She shrieked and threw herself backwards , and Gon , who had been curled up on a stool at her feet , understood her terror , and with one bound seized the snake by his neck .
He gave him one bite and one shake , and flung him on the ground , where he lay , never to worry the princess any more .
Then she took Gon in her arms , and praised and caressed him , and saw that he had the nicest bits to eat , and the softest mats to lie on ; and he would have had nothing in the world to wish for if only he could have seen Koma again .
Time passed on , and one morning Gon lay before the house door , basking in the sun .
He looked lazily at the world stretched out before him , and saw in the distance a big ruffian of a cat teasing and ill-treating quite a little one .
He jumped up , full of rage , and chased away the big cat , and then he turned to comfort the little one , when his heart nearly burst with joy to find that it was Koma .
At first Koma did not know him again , he had grown so large and stately ; but when it dawned upon her who it was , her happiness knew no bounds .
And they rubbed their heads and their noses again and again , while their purring might have been heard a mile off .
Paw in paw they appeared before the princess , and told her the story of their life and its sorrows .
The princess wept for sympathy , and promised that they should never more be parted , but should live with her to the end of their days .
By-and-bye the princess herself got married , and brought a prince to dwell in the palace in the park .
And she told him all about her two cats , and how brave Gon had been , and how he had delivered her from her enemy the serpent .
And when the prince heard , he swore they should never leave them , but should go with the princess wherever she went .
So it all fell out as the princess wished ; and Gon and Koma had many children , and so had the princess , and they all played together , and were friends to the end of their lives .
How the Dragon Was Tricked From Griechtsche und Albanesische Marchen , von J. G. von Hahn .
-LRB- Leipzig : Engelmann .
1864 . -RRB-
Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons but they did not get on at all well together , for the younger was much handsomer than his elder brother who was very jealous of him .
When they grew older , things became worse and worse , and at last one day as they were walking through a wood the elder youth seized hold of the other , tied him to a tree , and went on his way hoping that the boy might starve to death .
However , it happened that an old and humpbacked shepherd passed the tree with his flock , and seeing the prisoner , he stopped and said to him , ` Tell me , my son why are you tied to that tree ? '
` Because I was so crooked , ' answered the young man ; ` but it has quite cured me , and now my back is as straight as can be . ' '
I wish you would bind me to a tree , ' exclaimed the shepherd , ` so that my back would get straight . '
` With all the pleasure in life , ' replied the youth .
` If you will loosen these cords I will tie you up with them as firmly as I can . '
This was soon done , and then the young man drove off the sheep , leaving their real shepherd to repent of his folly ; and before he had gone very far he met with a horse boy and a driver of oxen , and he persuaded them to turn with him and to seek for adventures .
By these and many other tricks he soon became so celebrated that his fame reached the king 's ears , and his majesty was filled with curiosity to see the man who had managed to outwit everybody .
So he commanded his guards to capture the young man and bring him before him .
And when the young man stood before the king , the king spoke to him and said , ` By your tricks and the pranks that you have played on other people , you have , in the eye of the law , forfeited your life .
But on one condition I will spare you , and that is , if you will bring me the flying horse that belongs to the great dragon .
Fail in this , and you shall be hewn in a thousand pieces . '
` If that is all , ' said the youth , ` you shall soon have it . '
So he went out and made his way straight to the stable where the flying horse was tethered .
He stretched his hand cautiously out to seize the bridle , when the horse suddenly began to neigh as loud as he could .
Now the room in which the dragon slept was just above the stable , and at the sound of the neighing he woke and cried to the horse , ` What is the matter , my treasure ?
is anything hurting you ? '
After waiting a little while the young man tried again to loose the horse , but a second time it neighed so loudly that the dragon woke up in a hurry and called out to know why the horse was making such a noise .
But when the same thing happened the third time , the dragon lost his temper , and went down into the stable and took a whip and gave the horse a good beating .
This offended the horse and made him angry , and when the young man stretched out his hand to untie his head , he made no further fuss , but suffered himself to be led quietly away .
Once clear of the stable the young man sprang on his back and galloped off , calling over his shoulder , ` Hi !
dragon !
dragon !
if anyone asks you what has become of your horse , you can say that I have got him ! '
But the king said , ` The flying horse is all very well , but I want something more .
You must bring me the covering with the little bells that lies on the bed of the dragon , or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . '
` Is that all ? '
answered the youth .
` That is easily done . '
And when night came he went away to the dragon 's house and climbed up on to the roof .
Then he opened a little window in the roof and let down the chain from which the kettle usually hung , and tried to hook the bed covering and to draw it up .
But the little bells all began to ring , and the dragon woke and said to his wife , ` Wife , you have pulled off all the bed-clothes ! '
and drew the covering towards him , pulling , as he did so , the young man into the room .
Then the dragon flung himself on the youth and bound him fast with cords saying as he tied the last knot , ` To-morrow when I go to church you must stay at home and kill him and cook him , and when I get back we will eat him together . '
So the following morning the dragoness took hold of the young man and reached down from the shelf a sharp knife with which to kill him .
But as she untied the cords the better to get hold of him , the prisoner caught her by the legs , threw her to the ground , seized her and speedily cut her throat , just as she had been about to do for him , and put her body in the oven .
Then he snatched up the covering and carried it to the king .
The king was seated on his throne when the youth appeared before him and spread out the covering with a deep bow .
` That is not enough , ' said his majesty ; ` you must bring me the dragon himself , or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . '
` It shall be done , ' answered the youth ; ` but you must give me two years to manage it , for my beard must grow so that he may not know me . '
` So be it , ' said the king .
And the first thing the young man did when his beard was grown was to take the road to the dragon 's house and on the way he met a beggar , whom he persuaded to change clothes with him , and in the beggar 's garments he went fearlessly forth to the dragon .
He found his enemy before his house , very busy making a box , and addressed him politely , ` Good morning , your worship .
Have you a morsel of bread ? '
` You must wait , ' replied the dragon , 'till I have finished my box , and then I will see if I can find one . '
` What will you do with the box when it is made ? '
inquired the beggar .
` It is for the young man who killed my wife , and stole my flying horse and my bed covering , ' said the dragon .
` He deserves nothing better , ' answered the beggar , ` for it was an ill deed .
Still that box is too small for him , for he is a big man . '
` You are wrong , ' said the dragon .
` The box is large enough even for me . '
` Well , the rogue is nearly as tall as you , ' replied the beggar , ` and , of course , if you can get in , he can .
But I am sure you would find it a tight fit . '
` No , there is plenty of room , ' said the dragon , tucking himself carefully inside .
But no sooner was he well in , than the young man clapped on the lid and called out , ` Now press hard , just to see if he will be able to get out . '
The dragon pressed as hard as he could , but the lid never moved .
` It is all right , ' he cried ; ` now you can open it . '
But instead of opening it , the young man drove in long nails to make it tighter still ; then he took the box on his back and brought it to the king .
And when the king heard that the dragon was inside , he was so excited that he would not wait one moment , but broke the lock and lifted the lid just a little way to make sure he was really there .
He was very careful not to leave enough space for the dragon to jump out , but unluckily there was just room for his great mouth , and with one snap the king vanished down his wide red jaws .
Then the young man married the king 's daughter and ruled over the land , but what he did with the dragon nobody knows .
The Goblin and the Grocer Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
There was once a hard-working student who lived in an attic , and he had nothing in the world of his own .
There was also a hard-working grocer who lived on the first floor , and he had the whole house for his own .
The Goblin belonged to him , for every Christmas Eve there was waiting for him at the grocer 's a dish of jam with a large lump of butter in the middle .
The grocer could afford this , so the Goblin stayed in the grocer 's shop ; and this teaches us a good deal .
One evening the student came in by the back door to buy a candle and some cheese ; he had no one to send , so he came himself .
He got what he wanted , paid for it , and nodded a good evening to the grocer and his wife -LRB- she was a woman who could do more than nod ; she could talk -RRB- .
When the student had said good night he suddenly stood still , reading the sheet of paper in which the cheese had been wrapped .
It was a leaf torn out of an old book -- a book of poetry ` There 's more of that over there ! '
said the grocer ' I gave an old woman some coffee for the book .
If you like to give me twopence you can have the rest . '
` Yes , ' said the student , ` give me the book instead of the cheese .
I can eat my bread without cheese .
It would be a shame to leave the book to be torn up .
You are a clever and practical man , but about poetry you understand as much as that old tub over there ! '
And that sounded rude as far as the tub was concerned , but the grocer laughed , and so did the student .
It was only said in fun .
But the Goblin was angry that anyone should dare to say such a thing to a grocer who owned the house and sold the best butter .
When it was night and the shop was shut , and everyone was in bed except the student , the Goblin went upstairs and took the grocer 's wife 's tongue .
She did not use it when she was asleep , and on whatever object in the room he put it that thing began to speak , and spoke out its thoughts and feelings just as well as the lady to whom it belonged .
But only one thing at a time could use it , and that was a good thing , or they would have all spoken together .
The Goblin laid the tongue on the tub in which were the old newspapers .
` Is it true , ' he asked , ' that you know nothing about poetry ? '
` Certainly not ! '
answered the tub .
` Poetry is something that is in the papers , and that is frequently cut out .
I have a great deal more in me than the student has , and yet I am only a small tub in the grocer 's shop . '
And the Goblin put the tongue on the coffee-mill , and how it began to grind !
He put it on the butter-cask , and on the till , and all were of the same opinion as the waste-paper tub .
and one must believe the majority .
` Now I will tell the student ! '
and with these words he crept softly up the stairs to the attic where the student lived .
There was a light burning , and the Goblin peeped through the key-hole and saw that he was reading the torn book that he had bought in the shop .
But how bright it was !
Out of the book shot a streak of light which grew into a large tree and spread its branches far above the student .
Every leaf was alive , and every flower was a beautiful girl 's head , some with dark and shining eyes , others with wonderful blue ones .
Every fruit was a glittering star , and there was a marvellous music in the student 's room .
The little Goblin had never even dreamt of such a splendid sight , much less seen it .
He stood on tiptoe gazing and gazing , till the candle in the attic was put out ; the student had blown it out and had gone to bed , but the Goblin remained standing outside listening to the music , which very softly and sweetly was now singing the student a lullaby . '
I have never seen anything like this ! '
said the Goblin . '
I never expected this !
I must stay with the student . '
The little fellow thought it over , for he was a sensible Goblin .
Then he sighed , ` The student has no jam ! '
And on that he went down to the grocer again .
And it was a good thing that he did go back , for the tub had nearly worn out the tongue .
It had read everything that was inside it , on the one side , and was just going to turn itself round and read from the other side when the Goblin came in and returned the tongue to its owner .
But the whole shop , from the till down to the shavings , from that night changed their opinion of the tub , and they looked up to it , and had such faith in it that they were under the impression that when the grocer read the art and drama critiques out of the paper in the evenings , it all came from the tub .
But the Goblin could no longer sit quietly listening to the wisdom and intellect downstairs .
No , as soon as the light shone in the evening from the attic it seemed to him as though its beams were strong ropes dragging him up , and he had to go and peep through the key-hole .
There he felt the sort of feeling we have looking at the great rolling sea in a storm , and he burst into tears .
He could not himself say why he wept , but in spite of his tears he felt quite happy .
How beautiful it must be to sit under that tree with the student , but that he could not do ; he had to content himself with the key-hole and be happy there !
There he stood out on the cold landing , the autumn wind blowing through the cracks of the floor .
It was cold -- very cold , but he first found it out when the light in the attic was put out and the music in the wood died away .
Ah !
then it froze him , and he crept down again into his warm corner ; there it was comfortable and cosy .
When Christmas came , and with it the jam with the large lump of butter , ah !
then the grocer was first with him .
But in the middle of the night the Goblin awoke , hearing a great noise and knocking against the shutters -- people hammering from outside .
The watchman was blowing his horn : a great fire had broken out ; the whole town was in flames .
Was it in the house ?
or was it at a neighbour 's ?
Where was it ?
The alarm increased .
The grocer 's wife was so terrified that she took her gold earrings out of her ears and put them in her pocket in order to save something .
The grocer seized his account books .
and the maid her black silk dress .
Everyone wanted to save his most valuable possession ; so did the Goblin , and in a few leaps he was up the stairs and in the student 's room .
He was standing quietly by the open window looking at the fire that was burning in the neighbour 's house just opposite .
The Goblin seized the book lying on the table , put it in his red cap , and clasped it with both hands .
The best treasure in the house was saved , and he climbed out on to the roof with it -- on to the chimney .
There he sat , lighted up by the flames from the burning house opposite , both hands holding tightly on his red cap , in which lay the treasure ; and now he knew what his heart really valued most -- to whom he really belonged .
But when the fire was put out , and the Goblin thought it over -- then -- ' I will divide myself between the two , ' he said . '
I can not quite give up the grocer , because of the jam ! '
And it is just the same with us .
We also can not quite give up the grocer -- because of the jam .
The House in the Wood From the German of Grimm .
A poor woodcutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the borders of a great forest .
One morning as he was going to his work , he said to his wife , ` Let our eldest daughter bring me my lunch into the wood ; and so that she shall not lose her way , I will take a bag of millet with me , and sprinkle the seed on the path . '
When the sun had risen high over the forest , the girl set out with a basin of soup .
But the field and wood sparrows , the larks and finches , blackbirds and green finches had picked up the millet long ago , and the girl could not find her way .
She went on and on , till the sun set and night came on .
The trees rustled in the darkness , the owls hooted , and she began to be very much frightened .
Then she saw in tile distance a light that twinkled between the trees .
` There must be people living yonder , ' she thought , ` who will take me in for the night , ' and she began walking towards it .
Not long afterwards she came to a house with lights in the windows .
She knocked at the door , and a gruff voice called , ` Come in ! '
The girl stepped into the dark entrance , and tapped at the door of the room .
` Just walk in , ' cried the voice , and when she opened the door there sat an old gray-haired man at the table .
His face was resting on his hands , and his white beard flowed over the table almost down to the ground .
By the stove lay three beasts , a hen , a cock , and a brindled cow .
The girl told the old man her story , and asked for a night 's lodging .
The man said : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?
` Duks , ' answered the beasts ; and that must have meant , ` We are quite willing , ' for the old man went on , ` Here is abundance ; go into the back kitchen and cook us a supper . '
The girl found plenty of everything in the kitchen , and cooked a good meal , but she did not think of the beasts .
She placed the full dishes on the table , sat down opposite the gray-haired man , and ate till her hunger was appeased .
When she was satisfied , she said , ` But now I am so tired , where is a bed in which I can sleep ? '
The beasts answered : You have eaten with him , You have drunk with him , Of us you have not thought , Sleep then as you ought !
Then the old man said , ` Go upstairs , and there you will find a bedroom ; shake the bed , and put clean sheets on , and go to sleep . '
The maiden went upstairs , and when she had made the bed , she lay down .
After some time the gray-haired man came , looked at her by the light of his candle , and shook his head .
And when he saw that she was sound asleep , he opened a trapdoor and let her fall into the cellar .
The woodcutter came home late in the evening , and reproached his wife for leaving him all day without food .
` No , I did not , ' she answered ; ` the girl went off with your dinner .
She must have lost her way , but will no doubt come back to-morrow . '
But at daybreak the woodcutter started off into the wood , and this time asked his second daughter to bring his food . '
I will take a bag of lentils , ' said he ; ` they are larger than millet , and the girl will see them better and be sure to find her way . '
At midday the maiden took the food , but the lentils had all gone ; as on the previous day , the wood birds had eaten them all .
The maiden wandered about the wood till nightfall , when she came in the same way to the old man 's house , and asked for food and a night 's lodging .
The man with the white hair again asked the beasts : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?
The beasts answered , ` Duks , ' and everything happened as on the former day .
The girl cooked a good meal , ate and drank with the old man , and did not trouble herself about the animals .
And when she asked for a bed , they replied : You have eaten with him You have drunk with him , Of us you have not thought , Now sleep as you ought !
And when she was asleep , the old man shook his head over her , and let her fall into the cellar .
On the third morning the woodcutter said to his wife , ` Send our youngest child to-day with my dinner .
She is always good and obedient , and will keep to the right path , and not wander away like her sisters , idle drones ! '
But the mother said , ` Must I lose my dearest child too ? '
` Do not fear , ' he answered ; ` she is too clever and intelligent to lose her way .
I will take plenty of peas with me and strew them along ; they are even larger than lentils , and will show her the way . '
But when the maiden started off with the basket on her arm , the wood pigeons had eaten up the peas , and she did not know which way to go .
She was much distressed , and thought constantly of her poor hungry father and her anxious mother .
At last , when it grew dark , she saw the little light , and came to the house in the wood .
She asked prettily if she might stay there for the night , and the man with the white beard asked his beasts again : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?
` Duks , ' they said .
Then the maiden stepped up to the stove where the animals were lying , and stroked the cock and the hen , and scratched the brindled cow between its horns .
And when at the bidding of the old man she had prepared a good supper , and the dishes were standing on the table , she said , ` Shall I have plenty while the good beasts have nothing ?
There is food to spare outside ; I will attend to them first . '
Then she went out and fetched barley and strewed it before the cock and hen , and brought the cow an armful of sweet-smelling hay .
` Eat that , dear beasts , ' she said , ' and when you are thirsty you shall have a good drink . '
Then she fetched a bowl of water , and the cock and hen flew on to the edge , put their beaks in , and then held up their heads as birds do when they drink , and the brindled cow also drank her fill .
When the beasts were satisfied , the maiden sat down beside the old man at the table and ate what was left for her .
Soon the cock and hen began to tuck their heads under their wings , and the brindled cow blinked its eyes , so the maiden said , ` Shall we not go to rest now ? '
Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?
The animals said , ` Duks : You have eaten with us , You have drunk with us , You have tended us right , So we wish you good night . '
The maiden therefore went upstairs , made the bed and put on clean sheets and fell asleep .
She slept peacefully till midnight , when there was such a noise in the house that she awoke .
Everything trembled and shook ; the animals sprang up and dashed themselves in terror against the wall ; the beams swayed as if they would be torn from their foundations , it seemed as if the stairs were tumbling down , and then the roof fell in with a crash .
Then all became still , and as no harm came to the maiden she lay down again and fell asleep .
But when she awoke again in broad daylight , what a sight met her eyes !
She was lying in a splendid room furnished with royal splendour ; the walls were covered with golden flowers on a green ground ; the bed was of ivory and the counterpane of velvet , and on a stool near by lay a pair of slippers studded with pearls .
The maiden thought she must be dreaming , but in came three servants richly dressed , who asked what were her commands .
` Go , ' said the maiden , ' I will get up at once and cook the old man 's supper for him , and then I will feed the pretty cock and hen and the brindled cow . '
But the door opened and in came a handsome young man , who said , ' I am a king 's son , and was condemned by a wicked witch to live as an old man in this wood with no company but that of my three servants , who were transformed into a cock , a hen , and a brindled cow .
The spell could only be broken by the arrival of a maiden who should show herself kind not only to men but to beasts .
You are that maiden , and last night at midnight we were freed , and this poor house was again transformed into my royal palace .
As they stood there the king 's son told his three servants to go and fetch the maiden 's parents to be present at the wedding feast .
` But where are my two sisters ? '
asked the maid . '
I shut them up in the cellar , but in the morning they shall be led forth into the forest and shall serve a charcoal burner until they have improved , and will never again suffer poor animals to go hungry . '
Uraschimataro and the Turtle From the Japanische Marchen und Sagen , von David Brauns -LRB- Leipzig : Wilhelm Friedrich -RRB- .
There was once a worthy old couple who lived on the coast , and supported themselves by fishing .
They had only one child , a son , who was their pride and joy , and for his sake they were ready to work hard all day long , and never felt tired or discontented with their lot .
This son 's name was Uraschimataro , which means in Japanese , ` Son of the island , ' and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman , minding neither wind nor weather .
Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro , and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents , ` If your son goes on being so rash , one day he will try his luck once too often , and the waves will end by swallowing him up . '
But Uraschimataro paid no heed to these remarks , and as he was really very clever in managing a boat , the old people were very seldom anxious about him .
One beautiful bright morning , as he was hauling his well-filled nets into the boat , he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle .
He was delighted with his prize , and threw it into a wooden vessel to keep till he got home , when suddenly the turtle found its voice , and tremblingly begged for its life .
` After all , ' it said , ` what good can I do you ?
I am so young and small , and I would so gladly live a little longer .
Be merciful and set me free , and I shall know how to prove my gratitude . '
Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured , and besides , he could never bear to say no , so he picked up the turtle , and put it back into the sea .
Years flew by , and every morning Uraschimataro sailed his boat into the deep sea .
But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks , there arose a fierce whirlwind , which shattered his boat to pieces , and she was sucked under by the waves .
Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate .
But he was a powerful swimmer , and struggled hard to reach the shore .
Then he saw a large turtle coming towards him , and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said : ' I am the turtle whose life you once saved .
I will now pay my debt and show my gratitude .
The land is still far distant , and without my help you would never get there .
Climb on my back , and I will take you where you will . '
Uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice , and thankfully accepted his friend 's help .
But scarcely was he seated firmly on the shell , when the turtle proposed that they should not return to the shore at once , but go under the sea , and look at some of the wonders that lay hidden there .
Uraschimataro agreed willingly , and in another moment they were deep , deep down , with fathoms of blue water above their heads .
Oh , how quickly they darted through the still , warm sea !
The young man held tight , and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel , but for three days they rushed on , till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace , shining with gold and silver , crystal and precious stones , and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls .
But if Uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside , he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within , which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales .
` Where have you brought me ? '
he asked his guide in a low voice .
` To the palace of Ringu , the house of the sea god , whose subjects we all are , ' answered the turtle . '
I am the first waiting maid of his daughter , the lovely princess Otohime , whom you will shortly see . '
Uraschimataro was still so puzzled with the adventures that had befallen him , that he waited in a dazed condition for what would happen next .
But the turtle , who had talked so much of him to the princess that she had expressed a wish to see him , went at once to make known his arrival .
And directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him , and she begged him to stay with her , and in return promised that he should never grow old , neither should his beauty fade .
` Is not that reward enough ? '
she asked , smiling , looking all the while as fair as the sun itself .
And Uraschimataro said ` Yes , ' and so he stayed there .
For how long ?
That he only knew later .
His life passed by , and each hour seemed happier than the last , when one day there rushed over him a terrible longing to see his parents .
He fought against it hard , knowing how it would grieve the princess , but it grew on him stronger and stronger , till at length he became so sad that the princess inquired what was wrong .
Then he told her of the longing he had to visit his old home , and that he must see his parents once more .
The princess was almost frozen with horror , and implored him to stay with her , or something dreadful would be sure to happen .
` You will never come back , and we shall meet again no more , ' she moaned bitterly .
But Uraschimataro stood firm and repeated , ` Only this once will I leave you , and then will I return to your side for ever . '
Sadly the princess shook her head , but she answered slowly , ` One way there is to bring you safely back , but I fear you will never agree to the conditions of the bargain . ' '
I will do anything that will bring me back to you , ' exclaimed Uraschimataro , looking at her tenderly , but the princess was silent : she knew too well that when he left her she would see his face no more .
Then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box , and gave it to Uraschimataro , praying him to keep it carefully , and above all things never to open it .
` If you can do this , ' she said as she bade him farewell , ` your friend the turtle will meet you at the shore , and will carry you back to me . '
Uraschimataro thanked her from his heart , and swore solemnly to do her bidding .
He hid the box safely in his garments , seated himself on the back of the turtle , and vanished in the ocean path , waving his hand to the princess .
Three days and three nights they swam through the sea , and at length Uraschimataro arrived at the beach which lay before his old home .
The turtle bade him farewell , and was gone in a moment .
Uraschimataro drew near to the village with quick and joyful steps .
He saw the smoke curling through the roof , and the thatch where green plants had thickly sprouted .
He heard the children shouting and calling , and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto , and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return .
Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street .
After all , everything was changed .
Neither men nor houses were those he once knew .
Quickly he saw his old home ; yes , it was still there , but it had a strange look .
Anxiously he knocked at the door , and asked the woman who opened it after his parents .
But she did not know their names , and could give him no news of them .
Still more disturbed , he rushed to the burying ground , the only place that could tell him what he wished to know .
Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant .
And he was right .
In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents , and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son , and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea .
And so he found that since he had deft his home , three hundred years had passed by .
Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street , hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old .
But when the man spoke , he knew he was not dreaming , though he felt as if he had lost his senses .
In despair he bethought him of the box which was the gift of the princess .
Perhaps after all this dreadful thing was not true .
He might be the victim of some enchanter 's spell , and in his hand lay the counter-charm .
Almost unconsciously he opened it , and a purple vapour came pouring out .
He held the empty box in his hand , and as he looked he saw that the fresh hand of youth had grown suddenly shrivelled , like the hand of an old , old man .
He ran to the brook , which flowed in a clear stream down from the mountain .
and saw himself reflected as in a mirror .
It was the face of a mummy which looked back at him .
Wounded to death , he crept back through the village , and no man knew the old , old man to be the strong handsome youth who had run down the street an hour before .
So he toiled wearily back , till he reached the shore , and here he sat sadly on a rock , and called loudly on the turtle .
But she never came back any more , but instead , death came soon , and set him free .
But before that happened , the people who saw him sitting lonely on the shore had heard his story , and when their children were restless they used to tell them of the good son who from love to his parents had given up for their sakes the splendour and wonders of the palace in the sea , and the most beautiful woman in the world besides .
The Slaying of the Tanuki From the Japanische Murchen und Sagen .
Near a big river , and between two high mountains , a man and his wife lived in a cottage a long , long time ago .
A dense forest lay all round the cottage , and there was hardly a path or a tree in the whole wood that was not familiar to the peasant from his boyhood .
In one of his wanderings he had made friends with a hare , and many an hour the two passed together , when the man was resting by the roadside , eating his dinner .
Now this strange friendship was observed by the Tanuki , a wicked , quarrelsome beast , who hated the peasant , and was never tired of doing him an ill turn .
Again and again he had crept to the hut , and finding some choice morsel put away for the little hare , had either eaten it if he thought it nice , or trampled it to pieces so that no one else should get it , and at last the peasant lost patience , and made up his mind he would have the Tanuki 's blood .
So for many days the man lay hidden , waiting for the Tanuki to come by , and when one morning he marched up the road thinking of nothing but the dinner he was going to steal , the peasant threw himself upon him and bound his four legs tightly , so that he could not move .
Then he dragged his enemy joyfully to the house , feeling that at length he had got the better of the mischievous beast which had done him so many ill turns .
` He shall pay for them with his skin , ' he said to his wife .
` We will first kill him , and then cook him . '
So saying , he hanged the Tanuki , head downwards , to a beam , and went out to gather wood for a fire .
Meanwhile the old woman was standing at the mortar pounding the rise that was to serve them for the week with a pestle that made her arms ache with its weight .
Suddenly she heard something whining and weeping in the corner , and , stopping her work , she looked round to see what it was .
That was all that the rascal wanted , and he put on directly his most humble air , and begged the woman in his softest voice to loosen his bonds , which her hurting him sorely .
She was filled with pity for him , but did not dare to set him free , as she knew that her husband would be very angry .
The Tanuki , however , did not despair , and seeing that her heart was softened , began his prayers anew .
` He only asked to have his bonds taken from him , ' he said .
` He would give his word not to attempt to escape , and if he was once set free he could soon pound her rice for her . '
` Then you can have a little rest , ' he went on , ` for rice pounding is very tiring work , and not at all fit for weak women . '
These last words melted the good woman completely , and she unfastened the bonds that held him .
Poor foolish creature !
In one moment the Tanuki had seized her , stripped off all her clothes , and popped her in the mortar .
In a few minutes more she was pounded as fine as the rice ; and not content with that , the Tanuki placed a pot on the hearth and made ready to cook the peasant a dinner from the flesh of his own wife !
When everything was complete he looked out of the door , and saw the old man coming from the forest carrying a large bundle of wood .
Quick as lightning the Tanuki not only put on the woman 's clothes , but , as he was a magician , assumed her form as well .
Then he took the wood , kindled the fire , and very soon set a large dinner before the old man , who was very hungry , and had forgotten for the moment all about his enemy .
But when the Tanuki saw that he had eaten his fill and would be thinking about his prisoner , he hastily shook off the clothes behind a door and took his own shape .
Then he said to the peasant , ` You are a nice sort of person to seize animals and to talk of killing them !
You are caught in your own net .
It is your own wife that you have eaten , and if you want to find her bones you have only to look under the floor . '
With these words he turned and made for the forest .
The old peasant grew cold with horror as he listened , and seemed frozen to the place where he stood .
When he had recovered himself a little , he collected the bones of his dead wife , buried them in the garden , and swore over the grave to be avenged on the Tanuki .
After everything was done he sat himself down in his lonely cottage and wept bitterly , and the bitterest thought of all was that he would never be able to forget that he had eaten his own wife .
While he was thus weeping and wailing his friend the hare passed by , and , hearing the noise , pricked up his ears and soon recognised the old man 's voice .
He wondered what had happened , and put his head in at the door and asked if anything was the matter .
With tears and groans the peasant told him the whole dreadful story , and the hare , filled with anger and compassion , comforted him as best he could , and promised to help him in his revenge .
` The false knave shall not go unpunished , ' said he .
So the first thing he did was to search the house for materials to make an ointment , which he sprinkled plentifully with pepper and then put in his pocket .
Next he took a hatchet , bade farewell to the old man , and departed to the forest .
He bent his steps to the dwelling of the Tanuki and knocked at the door .
The Tanuki , who had no cause to suspect the hare , was greatly pleased to see him , for he noticed the hatchet at once , and began to lay plots how to get hold of it .
To do this he thought he had better offer to accompany the hare , which was exactly what the hare wished and expected , for he knew all the Tanuki 's cunning , and understood his little ways .
So he accepted the rascal 's company with joy , and made himself very pleasant as they strolled along .
When they were wandering in this manner through the forest the hare carelessly raised his hatchet in passing , and cut down some thick boughs that were hanging over the path , but at length , after cutting down a good big tree , which cost him many hard blows , he declared that it was too heavy for him to carry home , and he must just leave it where it was .
This delighted the greedy Tanuki , who said that they would be no weight for him , so they collected the large branches , which the hare bound tightly on his back .
Then he trotted gaily to the house , the hare following after with his lighter bundle .
By this time the hare had decided what he would do , and as soon as they arrived , he quietly set on fire the wood on the back of the Tanuki .
The Tanuki , who was busy with something else , observed nothing , and only called out to ask what was the meaning of the crackling that he heard .
` It is just the rattle of the stones which are rolling down the side of the mountain , ' the hare said ; and the Tanuki was content , and made no further remarks , never noticing that the noise really sprang from the burning boughs on his back , until his fur was in flames , and it was almost too late to put it out .
Shrieking with pain , he let fall the burning wood from his back , and stamped and howled with agony .
But the hare comforted him , and told him that he always carried with him an excellent plaster in case of need , which would bring him instant relief , and taking out his ointment he spread it on a leaf of bamboo , and laid it on the wound .
No sooner did it touch him than the Tanuki leapt yelling into the air , and the hare laughed , and ran to tell his friend the peasant what a trick he had played on their enemy .
But the old man shook his head sadly , for he knew that the villain was only crushed for the moment , and that he would shortly be revenging himself upon them .
No , the only way every to get any peace and quiet was to render the Tanuki harmless for ever .
Long did the old man and the hare puzzle together how this was to be done , and at last they decided that they would make two boats , a small one of wood and a large one of clay .
Then they fell to work at once , and when the boats were ready and properly painted , the hare went to the Tanuki , who was still very ill , and invited him to a great fish-catching .
The Tanuki was still feeling angry with the hare about the trick he had played him , but he was weak and very hungry , so he gladly accepted the proposal , and accompanied the hare to the bank of the river , where the two boats were moored , rocked by the waves .
They both looked exactly alike , and the Tanuki only saw that one was bigger than the other , and would hold more fish , so he sprang into the large one , while the hare climbed into the one which was made of wood .
They loosened their moorings , and made for the middle of the stream , and when they were at some distance from the bank , the hare took his oar , and struck such a heavy blow at the other boat , that it broke in two .
The Tanuki fell straight into the water , and was held there by the hare till he was quite dead .
Then he put the body in his boat and rowed to land , and told the old man that his enemy was dead at last .
And the old man rejoiced that his wife was avenged , and he took the hare into his house , and they lived together all their days in peace and quietness upon the mountain .
The Flying Trunk Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
There was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have paved the whole street , and perhaps even a little side-street besides , with silver .
But he did not do that ; he knew another way of spending his money .
If he spent a shilling he got back a florin-such an excellent merchant he was till he died .
Now his son inherited all this money .
He lived very merrily ; he went every night to the theatre , made paper kites out of five-pound notes , and played ducks and drakes with sovereigns instead of stones .
In this way the money was likely to come soon to an end , and so it did .
At last he had nothing left but four shillings , and he had no clothes except a pair of slippers and an old dressing-gown .
His friends did not trouble themselves any more about him ; they would not even walk down the street with him .
But one of them who was rather good-natured sent him an old trunk with the message , ` Pack up ! ''
That was all very well , but he had nothing to pack up , so he got into the trunk himself .
It was an enchanted trunk , for as soon as the lock was pressed it could fly .
He pressed it , and away he flew in it up the chimney , high into the clouds , further and further away .
But whenever the bottom gave a little creak he was in terror lest the trunk should go to pieces , for then he would have turned a dreadful somersault-just think of it !
In this way he arrived at the land of the Turks .
He hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves , and then walked into the town .
He could do that quite well , for all the Turks were dressed just as he was-in a dressing-gown and slippers .
He met a nurse with a little child .
` Halloa !
you Turkish nurse , ' said he , ` what is that great castle there close to the town ?
The one with the windows so high up ? '
` The sultan 's daughter lives there , ' she replied .
` It is prophesied that she will be very unlucky in her husband , and so no one is allowed to see her except when the sultan and sultana are by . '
` Thank you , ' said the merchant 's son , and he went into the wood , sat himself in his trunk , flew on to the roof , and crept through the window into the princess 's room .
She was lying on the sofa asleep , and was so beautiful that the young merchant had to kiss her .
Then she woke up and was very much frightened , but he said he was a Turkish god who had come through the air to see her , and that pleased her very much .
They sat close to each other , and he told her a story about her eyes .
They were beautiful dark lakes in which her thoughts swam about like mermaids .
And her forehead was a snowy mountain , grand and shining .
These were lovely stories .
Then he asked the princess to marry him , and she said yes at once .
` But you must come here on Saturday , ' she said , ` for then the sultan and the sultana are coming to tea with me .
They will be indeed proud that I receive the god of the Turks .
But mind you have a really good story ready , for my parents like them immensely .
My mother likes something rather moral and high-flown , and my father likes something merry to make him laugh . '
` Yes , I shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry , ' said he , and so they parted .
But the princess gave him a sabre set with gold pieces which he could use .
Then he flew away , bought himself a new dressing-gown , and sat down in the wood and began to make up a story , for it had to be ready by Saturday , and that was no easy matter .
When he had it ready it was Saturday .
The sultan , the sultana , and the whole court were at tea with the princess .
He was most graciously received .
` Will you tell us a story ? '
said the sultana ; ` one that is thoughtful and instructive ? '
` But something that we can laugh at , ' said the sultan .
` Oh , certainly , ' he replied , and began : ` Now , listen attentively .
There was once a box of matches which lay between a tinder-box and an old iron pot , and they told the story of their youth . '
`` We used to be on the green fir-boughs .
Every morning and evening we had diamond-tea , which was the dew , and the whole day long we had sunshine , and the little birds used to tell us stories .
We were very rich , because the other trees only dressed in summer , but we had green dresses in summer and in winter .
Then the woodcutter came , and our family was split up .
We have now the task of making light for the lowest people .
That is why we grand people are in the kitchen . '' '
`` My fate was quite different , '' said the iron pot , near which the matches lay . '
`` Since I came into the world I have been many times scoured , and have cooked much .
My only pleasure is to have a good chat with my companions when I am lying nice and clean in my place after dinner . '' '
`` Now you are talking too fast , '' spluttered the fire . '
`` Yes , let us decide who is the grandest ! ''
said the matches . '
`` No , I do n't like talking about myself , '' said the pot . '
`` Let us arrange an evening 's entertainment .
I will tell the story of my life . '
`` On the Baltic by the Danish shore - '' ` What a beautiful beginning ! ''
said all the plates .
`` That 's a story that will please us all . ''
` And the end was just as good as the beginning .
All the plates clattered for joy . '
`` Now I will dance , '' said the tongs , and she danced .
Oh !
how high she could kick !
` The old chair-cover in the corner split when he saw her .
` The urn would have sung but she said she had a cold ; she could not sing unless she boiled .
` In the window was an old quill pen .
There was nothing remarkable about her except that she had been dipped too deeply into the ink .
But she was very proud of that . '
`` If the urn will not sing , '' said she , `` outside the door hangs a nightingale in a cage who will sing . '' '
`` I do n't think it 's proper , '' said the kettle , `` that such a foreign bird should be heard . '' '
`` Oh , let us have some acting , '' said everyone .
`` Do let us ! ''
` Suddenly the door opened and the maid came in .
Everyone was quite quiet .
There was not a sound .
But each pot knew what he might have done , and how grand he was .
` The maid took the matches and lit the fire with them .
How they spluttered and flamed , to be sure !
`` Now everyone can see , '' they thought , `` that we are the grandest !
How we sparkle !
What a light - '' ` But here they were burnt out . '
` That was a delightful story ! '
said the sultana . '
I quite feel myself in the kitchen with the matches .
Yes , now you shall marry our daughter . '
` Yes , indeed , ' said the sultan , ` you shall marry our daughter on Monday . '
And they treated the young man as one of the family .
The wedding was arranged , and the night before the whole town was illuminated .
Biscuits and gingerbreads were thrown among the people , the street boys stood on tiptoe crying hurrahs and whistling through their fingers .
It was all splendid .
` Now I must also give them a treat , ' thought the merchant 's son .
And so he bought rockets , crackers , and all the kinds of fireworks you can think of , put them in his trunk , and flew up with them into the air .
Whirr-r-r , how they fizzed and blazed !
All the Turks jumped so high that their slippers flew above their heads ; such a splendid glitter they had never seen before .
Now they could quite well understand that it was the god of the Turks himself who was to marry the princess .
As soon as the young merchant came down again into the wood with his trunk he thought , ` Now I will just go into the town to see how the show has taken . '
And it was quite natural that he should want to do this .
Oh !
what stories the people had to tell !
Each one whom he asked had seen it differently , but they had all found it beautiful . '
I saw the Turkish god himself , ' said one .
` He had eyes like glittering stars , and a beard like foaming water . '
` He flew away in a cloak of fire , ' said another .
They were splendid things that he heard , and the next day was to be his wedding day .
Then he went back into the wood to sit in his trunk ; but what had become of it ?
The trunk had been burnt .
A spark of the fireworks had set it alight , and the trunk was in ashes .
He could no longer fly , and could never reach his bride .
She stood the whole day long on the roof and waited ; perhaps she is waiting there still .
But he wandered through the world and told stories ; though they are not so merry as the one he told about the matches .
The Snow-man Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
` How astonishingly cold it is !
My body is cracking all over ! '
said the Snow-man .
` The wind is really cutting one 's very life out !
And how that fiery thing up there glares ! '
He meant the sun , which was just setting .
` It sha 'n' t make me blink , though , and I shall keep quite cool and collected . '
Instead of eyes he had two large three-cornered pieces of slate in his head ; his mouth consisted of an old rake , so that he had teeth as well .
He was born amidst the shouts and laughter of the boys , and greeted by the jingling bells and cracking whips of the sledges .
The sun went down , the full moon rose , large , round , clear and beautiful , in the dark blue sky .
` There it is again on the other side ! '
said the Snow-man , by which he meant the sun was appearing again . '
I have become quite accustomed to its glaring .
I hope it will hang there and shine , so that I may be able to see myself .
I wish I knew , though , how one ought to see about changing one 's position .
I should very much like to move about .
If I only could , I would glide up and down the ice there , as I saw the boys doing ; but somehow or other , I do n't know how to run . '
` Bow-wow ! '
barked the old yard-dog ; he was rather hoarse and could n't bark very well .
His hoarseness came on when he was a house-dog and used to lie in front of the stove .
` The sun will soon teach you to run !
I saw that last winter with your predecessor , and farther back still with his predecessors !
They have all run away ! ' '
I do n't understand you , my friend , ' said the Snow-man .
` That thing up there is to teach me to run ? '
He meant the moon .
` Well , it certainly did run just now , for I saw it quite plainly over there , and now here it is on this side . '
` You know nothing at all about it , ' said the yard-dog .
` Why , you have only just been made .
The thing you see there is the moon ; the other thing you saw going down the other side was the sun .
He will come up again tomorrow morning , and will soon teach you how to run away down the gutter .
The weather is going to change ; I feel it already by the pain in my left hind-leg ; the weather is certainly going to change . ' '
I ca n't understand him , ' said the Snow-man ; ` but I have an idea that he is speaking of something unpleasant .
That thing that glares so , and then disappears , the sun , as he calls it , is not my friend .
I know that by instinct . '
` Bow-wow ! '
barked the yard-dog , and walked three times round himself , and then crept into his kennel to sleep .
The weather really did change .
Towards morning a dense damp fog lay over the whole neighbourhood ; later on came an icy wind , which sent the frost packing .
But when the sun rose , it was a glorious sight .
The trees and shrubs were covered with rime , and looked like a wood of coral , and every branch was thick with long white blossoms .
The most delicate twigs , which are lost among the foliage in summer-time , came now into prominence , and it was like a spider 's web of glistening white .
The lady-birches waved in the wind ; and when the sun shone , everything glittered and sparkled as if it were sprinkled with diamond dust , and great diamonds were lying on the snowy carpet .
` Is n't it wonderful ? '
exclaimed a girl who was walking with a young man in the garden .
They stopped near the Snow-man , and looked at the glistening trees .
` Summer can not show a more beautiful sight , ' she said , with her eyes shining .
` And one ca n't get a fellow like this in summer either , ' said the young man , pointing to the Snow-man .
` He 's a beauty ! '
The girl laughed , and nodded to the Snow-man , and then they both danced away over the snow .
` Who were those two ? '
asked the Snow-man of the yard-dog .
` You have been in this yard longer than I have .
Do you know who they are ? '
` Do I know them indeed ? '
answered the yard-dog .
` She has often stroked me , and he has given me bones .
I do n't bite either of them ! '
` But what are they ? '
asked the Snow-man .
` Lovers ! '
replied the yard-dog .
` They will go into one kennel and gnaw the same bone ! '
` Are they the same kind of beings that we are ? '
asked the Snow-man .
` They are our masters , ' answered the yard-dog .
` Really people who have only been in the world one day know very little . '
That 's the conclusion I have come to .
Now I have age and wisdom ; I know everyone in the house , and I can remember a time when I was not lying here in a cold kennel .
Bow-wow ! '
` The cold is splendid , ' said the Snow-man .
` Tell me some more .
But do n't rattle your chain so , it makes me crack ! '
` Bow-wow ! '
barked the yard-dog .
` They used to say I was a pretty little fellow ; then I lay in a velvet-covered chair in my master 's house .
My mistress used to nurse me , and kiss and fondle me , and call me her dear , sweet little Alice !
But by-and-by I grew too big , and I was given to the housekeeper , and I went into the kitchen .
You can see into it from where you are standing ; you can look at the room in which I was master , for so I was when I was with the housekeeper .
Of course it was a smaller place than upstairs , but it was more comfortable , for I was n't chased about and teased by the children as I had been before .
My food was just as good , or even better .
I had my own pillow , and there was a stove there , which at this time of year is the most beautiful thing in the world .
I used to creep right under that stove .
Ah me !
I often dream of that stove still !
Bow-wow ! '
` Is a stove so beautiful ? '
asked the Snow-man .
` Is it anything like me ? '
` It is just the opposite of you !
It is coal-black , and has a long neck with a brass pipe .
It eats firewood , so that fire spouts out of its mouth .
One has to keep close beside it-quite underneath is the nicest of all .
You can see it through the window from where you are standing . '
And the Snow-man looked in that direction , and saw a smooth polished object with a brass pipe .
The flicker from the fire reached him across the snow .
The Snow-man felt wonderfully happy , and a feeling came over him which he could not express ; but all those who are not snow-men know about it .
` Why did you leave her ? '
asked the Snow-man .
He had a feeling that such a being must be a lady .
` How could you leave such a place ? ' '
I had to ! '
said the yard-dog .
` They turned me out of doors , and chained me up here .
I had bitten the youngest boy in the leg , because he took away the bone I was gnawing ; a bone for a bone , I thought !
But they were very angry , and from that time I have been chained here , and I have lost my voice .
Do n't you hear how hoarse I am ?
Bow-wow !
I ca n't speak like other dogs .
Bow-wow !
That was the end of happiness ! '
The Snow-man , however , was not listening to him any more ; he was looking into the room where the housekeeper lived , where the stove stood on its four iron legs , and seemed to be just the same size as the Snow-man .
` How something is cracking inside me ! '
he said .
` Shall I never be able to get in there ?
It is certainly a very innocent wish , and our innocent wishes ought to be fulfilled .
I must get there , and lean against the stove , if I have to break the window first ! '
` You will never get inside there ! '
said the yard-dog ; ` and if you were to reach the stove you would disappear .
Bow-wow ! '
` I 'm as good as gone already ! '
answered the Snow-man . '
I believe I 'm breaking up ! '
The whole day the Snow-man looked through the window ; towards dusk the room grew still more inviting ; the stove gave out a mild light , not at all like the moon or even the sun ; no , as only a stove can shine , when it has something to feed upon .
When the door of the room was open , it flared up-this was one of its peculiarities ; it flickered quite red upon the Snow-man 's white face . '
I ca n't stand it any longer ! '
he said .
` How beautiful it looks with its tongue stretched out like that ! '
It was a long night , but the Snow-man did not find it so ; there he stood , wrapt in his pleasant thoughts , and they froze , so that he cracked .
Next morning the panes of the kitchen window were covered with ice , and the most beautiful ice-flowers that even a snow-man could desire , only they blotted out the stove .
The window would not open ; he could n't see the stove which he thought was such a lovely lady .
There was a cracking and cracking inside him and all around ; there was just such a frost as a snow-man would delight in .
But this Snow-man was different : how could he feel happy ?
` Yours is a bad illness for a Snow-man ! '
said the yard-dog . '
I also suffered from it , but I have got over it .
Bow-wow ! '
he barked .
` The weather is going to change ! '
he added .
The weather did change .
There came a thaw .
When this set in the Snow-man set off .
He did not say anything , and he did not complain , and those are bad signs .
One morning he broke up altogether .
And lo !
where he had stood there remained a broomstick standing upright , round which the boys had built him !
` Ah !
now I understand why he loved the stove , ' said the yard-dog .
` That is the raker they use to clean out the stove !
The Snow-man had a stove-raker in his body !
That 's what was the matter with him !
And now it 's all over with him !
Bow-wow ! '
And before long it was all over with the winter too !
` Bow-wow ! '
barked the hoarse yard-dog .
But the young girl sang : Woods , your bright green garments don !
Willows , your woolly gloves put on !
Lark and cuckoo , daily sing -- February has brought the spring !
My heart joins in your song so sweet ; Come out , dear sun , the world to greet !
And no one thought of the Snow-man .
The Shirt-collar Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
There was once a fine gentleman whose entire worldly possessions consisted of a boot-jack and a hair-brush ; but he had the most beautiful shirt-collar in the world , and it is about this that we are going to hear a story .
The shirt-collar was so old that he began to think about marrying ; and it happened one day that he and a garter came into the wash-tub together .
` Hulloa ! '
said the shirt-collar , ` never before have I seen anything so slim and delicate , so elegant and pretty !
May I be permitted to ask your name ? ' '
I sha n't tell you , ' said the garter .
` Where is the place of your abode ? '
asked the shirt-collar .
But the garter was of a bashful disposition , and did not think it proper to answer .
` Perhaps you are a girdle ? '
said the shirt-collar , ` an under girdle ?
for I see that you are for use as well as for ornament , my pretty miss ! '
` You ought not to speak to me ! '
said the garter ' ` I 'm sure I have n't given you any encouragement ! '
` When anyone is as beautiful as you , ' said the shirt-collar , ` is not that encouragement enough ? '
` Go away , do n't come so close ! '
said the garter .
` You seem to be a gentleman ! '
` So I am , and a very fine one too ! '
said the shirt-collar ; ' I possess a boot-jack and a hair-brush ! '
That was not true ; it was his master who owned these things ; but he was a terrible boaster .
` Do n't come so close , ' said the garter .
` I 'm not accustomed to such treatment ! '
` What affectation ! '
said the shirt-collar .
And then they were taken out of the wash-tub , starched , and hung on a chair in the sun to dry , and then laid on the ironing-board .
Then came the glowing iron .
` Mistress widow ! '
said the shirt-collar , ` dear mistress widow !
I am becoming another man , all my creases are coming out ; you are burning a hole in me !
Ugh !
Stop , I implore you ! '
` You rag ! '
said the iron , travelling proudly over the shirt-collar , for it thought it was a steam engine and ought to be at the station drawing trucks .
` Rag ! '
it said .
The shirt-collar was rather frayed out at the edge , so the scissors came to cut off the threads .
` Oh ! '
said the shirt-collar , ` you must be a dancer !
How high you can kick !
That is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen !
No man can imitate you ! ' '
I know that ! '
said the scissors .
` You ought to be a duchess ! '
said the shirt-collar .
` My worldly possessions consist of a fine gentleman , a boot-jack , and a hair-brush .
If only I had a duchy ! '
` What !
He wants to marry me ? '
said the scissors , and she was so angry that she gave the collar a sharp snip , so that it had to be cast aside as good for nothing .
` Well , I shall have to propose to the hair-brush ! '
thought the shirt-collar .
` It is really wonderful what fine hair you have , madam !
Have you never thought of marrying ? '
` Yes , that I have ! '
answered the hair-brush ; ` I 'm engaged to the boot-jack ! '
` Engaged ! '
exclaimed the shirt-collar .
And now there was no one he could marry , so he took to despising matrimony .
Time passed , and the shirt-collar came in a rag-bag to the paper-mill .
There was a large assortment of rags , the fine ones in one heap , and the coarse ones in another , as they should be .
They had all much to tell , but no one more than the shirt-collar , for he was a hopeless braggart . '
I have had a terrible number of love affairs ! '
he said .
` They give me no peace .
I was such a fine gentleman , so stiff with starch !
I had a boot-jack and a hair-brush , which I never used !
You should just have seen me then !
Never shall I forget my first love !
She was a girdle , so delicate and soft and pretty !
She threw herself into a wash-tub for my sake !
Then there was a widow , who glowed with love for me .
But I left her alone , till she became black .
Then there was the dancer , who inflicted the wound which has caused me to be here now ; she was very violent !
My own hair-brush was in love with me , and lost all her hair in consequence .
Yes , I have experienced much in that line ; but I grieve most of all for the garter,-I mean , the girdle , who threw herself into a wash-tub .
I have much on my conscience ; it is high time for me to become white paper ! '
And so he did !
he became white paper , the very paper on which this story is printed .
And that was because he had boasted so terribly about things which were not true .
We should take this to heart , so that it may not happen to us , for we can not indeed tell if we may not some day come to the rag-bag , and be made into white paper , on which will be printed our whole history , even the most secret parts , so that we too go about the world relating it , like the shirt-collar .
The Princess in the Chest Translated from the Danish .
There were once a king and a queen who lived in a beautiful castle , and had a large , and fair , and rich , and happy land to rule over .
From the very first they loved each other greatly , and lived very happily together , but they had no heir .
They had been married for seven years , but had neither son nor daughter , and that was a great grief to both of them .
More than once it happened that when the king was in a bad temper , he let it out on the poor queen , and said that here they were now , getting old , and neither they nor the kingdom had an heir , and it was all her fault .
This was hard to listen to , and she went and cried and vexed herself .
Finally , the king said to her one day , ` This ca n't be borne any longer .
I go about childless , and it 's your fault .
I am going on a journey and shall be away for a year .
If you have a child when I come back again , all will be well , and I shall love you beyond all measure , and never more say an angry word to you .
But if the nest is just as empty when I come home , then I must part with you . '
After the king had set out on his journey , the queen went about in her loneliness , and sorrowed and vexed herself more than ever .
At last her maid said to her one day , ' I think that some help could be found , if your majesty would seek it . '
Then she told about a wise old woman in that country , who had helped many in troubles of the same kind , and could no doubt help the queen as well , if she would send for her .
The queen did so , and the wise woman came , and to her she confided her sorrow , that she , was childless , and the king and his kingdom had no heir .
The wise woman knew help for this .
` Out in the king 's garden , ' said she , ` under the great oak that stands on the left hand , just as one goes out from the castle , is a little bush , rather brown than green , with hairy leaves and long spikes .
On that bush there are just at this moment three buds .
If your majesty goes out there alone , fasting , before sunrise , and takes the middle one of the three buds , and eats it , then in six months you will bring a princess into the world .
As soon as she is born , she must have a nurse , whom I shall provide , and this nurse must live with the child in a secluded part of the palace ; no other person must visit the child ; neither the king nor the queen must see it until it is fourteen years old , for that would cause great sorrow and misfortune . '
The queen rewarded the old woman richly , and next morning , before the sun rose , she was down in the garden , found at once the little bush with the three buds , plucked the middle one and ate it .
It was sweet to taste , but afterwards was as bitter as gall .
Six months after this , she brought into the world a little girl .
There was a nurse in readiness , whom the wise woman had provided , and preparations were made for her living with the child , quite alone , in a secluded wing of the castle , looking out on the pleasure-park .
The queen did as the wise woman had told her ; she gave up the child immediately , and the nurse took it and lived with it there .
When the king came home and heard that a daughter had been born to him , he was of course very pleased and happy , and wanted to see her at once .
The queen had then to tell him this much of the story , that it had been foretold that it would cause great sorrow and misfortune if either he or she got a sight of the child until it had completed its fourteenth year .
This was a long time to wait .
The king longed so much to get a sight of his daughter , and the queen no less than he , but she knew that it was not like other children , for it could speak immediately after it was born , and was as wise as older folk .
This the nurse had told her , for with her the queen had a talk now and again , but there was no one who had ever seen the princess .
The queen had also seen what the wise woman could do , so she insisted strongly that her warning should be obeyed .
The king often lost his patience , and was determined to see his daughter , but the queen always put him off the idea , and so things went on , until the very day before the princess completed her fourteenth year .
The king and the queen were out in the garden then , and the king said , ` Now I ca n't and I wo n't wait any longer .
I must see my daughter at once .
A few hours , more or less , ca n't make any difference . '
The queen begged him to have patience till the morning .
When they had waited so long , they could surely wait a single day more .
But the king was quite unreasonable .
` No nonsense , ' said he ; ` she is just as much mine as yours , and I will see her , ' and with that he went straight up to her room .
He burst the door open , and pushed aside the nurse , who tried to stop him , and there he saw his daughter .
She was the loveliest young princess , red and white , like milk and blood , with clear blue eyes and golden hair , but right in the middle of her forehead there was a little tuft of brown hair .
The princess went to meet her father , fell on his neck and kissed him , but with that she said , ' O father , father !
what have you done now ?
to-morrow I must die , and you must choose one of three things : either the land must be smitten with the black pestilence , or you must have a long and bloody war , or you must as soon as I am dead , lay me in a plain wooden chest , and set it in the church , and for a whole year place a sentinel beside it every night . '
The king was frightened indeed , and thought she was raving , but in order to please her , he said , ` Well , of these three things I shall choose the last ; if you die , I shall lay you at once in a plain wooden chest , and have it set in the church , and every night I shall place a sentinel beside it .
But you shall not die , even if you are ill now . '
He immediately summoned all the best doctors in the country , and they came with all their prescriptions and their medicine bottles , but next day the princess was stiff and cold in death .
All the doctors could certify to that and they all put their names to this and appended their seals , and then they had done all they could .
The king kept his promise .
The princess 's body was lain the same day in a plain wooden chest , and set in the chapel of the castle , and on that night and every night after it , a sentinel was posted in the church , to keep watch over the chest .
The first morning when they came to let the sentinel out , there was no sentinel there .
They thought he had just got frightened and run away , and next evening a new one was posted in the church .
In the morning he was also gone .
So it went every night .
When they came in the morning to let the sentinel out , there was no one there , and it was impossible to discover which way he had gone if he had run away .
And what should they run away for , every one of them , so that nothing more was over heard or seen of them , from the hour that they were set on guard beside the princess 's chest ?
It became now a general belief that the princess 's ghost walked , and ate up all those who were to guard her chest , and very soon there was no one left who would be placed on this duty , and the king 's soldiers deserted the service , before their turn came to be her bodyguard .
The king then promised a large reward to the soldier who would volunteer for the post .
This did for some time , as there were found a few reckless fellows , who wished to earn this good payment .
But they never got it , for in the morning , they too had disappeared like the rest .
So it had gone on for something like a whole year ; every night a sentinel had been placed beside the chest , either by compulsion or of his own free will , but not a single one of the sentinels was to be seen , either on the following day or any time thereafter .
And so it had also gone with one , on the night before a certain day , when a merry young smith came wandering to the town where the king 's castle stood .
It was the capital of the country , and people of every king came to it to get work .
This smith , whose name was Christian , had come for that same purpose .
There was no work for him in the place he belonged to , and he wanted now to seek a place in the capital .
There he entered an inn where he sat down in the public room , and got something to eat .
Some under-officers were sitting there , who were out to try to get some one enlisted to stand sentry .
They had to go in this way , day after day , and hitherto they had always succeeded in finding one or other reckless fellow .
But on this day they had , as yet , found no one .
It was too well known how all the sentinels disappeared , who were set on that post , and all that they had got hold of had refused with thanks .
These sat down beside Christian , and ordered drinks , and drank along with him .
Now Christian was a merry fellow who liked good company ; he could both drink and sing , and talk and boast as well , when he got a little drop in his head .
He told these under-officers that he was one of that kind of folk who never are afraid of anything .
Then he was just the kind of man they liked , said they , and he might easily earn a good penny , before he was a day older , for the king paid a hundred dollars to anyone who would stand as sentinel in the church all night , beside his daughter 's chest .
Christian was not afraid of that he was n't afraid of anything , so they drank another bottle of wine on this , and Christian went with them up to the colonel , where he was put into uniform with musket , and all the rest , and was then shut up in the church , to stand as sentinel that night .
It was eight o'clock when he took up his post , and for the first hour he was quite proud of his courage ; during the second hour he was well pleased with the large reward that he would get , but in the third hour , when it was getting near eleven , the effects of the wine passed off , and he began to get uncomfortable , for he had heard about this post ; that no one had ever escapeed alive from it , so far as was known .
But neither did anyone know what had become of all the sentinels .
The thought of this ran in his head so much , after the wine was out of it , that he searched about everywhere for a way of escape , and finally , at eleven o'clock , he found a little postern in the steeple which was not locked , and out at this he crept , intending to run away .
At the same moment as he put his foot outside the church door , he saw standing before him a little man , who said , ` Good evening , Christian , where are you going ? '
With that he felt as if he were rooted to the spot and could not move .
` Nowhere , ' said he .
` Oh , yes , ' said the little man , ` You were just about to run away , but you have taken upon you to stand sentinel in the church to-night , and there you must stay . '
Christian said , very humbly , that he dared not , and therefore wanted to get away , and begged to be let go .
` No , ' said the little one , ` you must remain at your post , but I shall give you a piece of good advice ; you shall go up into the pulpit , and remain standing there .
You need never mind what you see or hear , it will not be able to do you any harm , if you remain in your place until you hear the lid of the chest slam down again behind the dead ; then all danger is past , and you can go about the church , wherever you please . '
The little man then pushed him in at the door again , and locked it after him .
Christian made haste to get up into the pulpit , and stood there , without noticing anything , until the clock struck twelve .
Then the lid of the princess 's chest sprang up , and out of it there came something like the princess , dressed as you see in the picture .
It shrieked and howled , ` Sentry , where are you ?
Sentry , where are you ?
If you do n't come , you shall get the most cruel death anyone had ever got . '
It went all round the church , and when it finally caught sight of the smith , up in the pulpit , it came rushing thither and mounted the steps .
But it could not get up the whole way , and for all that it stretched and strained , it could not touch Christian , who meanwhile stood and trembled up in the pulpit .
When the clock struck one , the appearance had to go back into the chest again , and Christian heard the lid slam after it .
After this there was dead silence in the church .
He lay down where he was and fell asleep , and did not awake before it was bright daylight , and he heard steps outside , and the noise of the key being put into the lock .
Then he came down from the pulpit , and stood with his musket in front of the princess 's chest .
It was the colonel himself who came with the patrol , and he was not a little surprised when he found the recruit safe and sound .
He wanted to have a report , but Christian would give him none , so he took him straight up to the king , and announced for the first time that here was the sentinel who had stood guard in the church over-night .
The king immediately got out of bed , and laid the hundred dollars for him on the table , and then wanted to question him .
` Have you seen anything ? '
said he .
` Have you seen my daughter ? ' '
I have stood at my post , ' said the young smith , ` and that is quite enough ; I undertook nothing more . '
He was not sure whether he dared tell what he had seen and heard , and besides he was also a little conceited because he had done what no other man had been able to do , or had had courage for .
The king professed to be quite satisfied , and asked him whether he would engage himself to stand on guard again the following night .
` No , thank you , ' said Christian , ' I will have no more of that ! '
` As you please , ' said the king , ` you have behaved like a brave fellow , and now you shall have your breakfast .
You must be needing something to strengthen you after that turn . '
The king had breakfast laid for him , and sat down at the table with him in person ; he kept constantly filling his glass for him and praising him , and drinking his health .
Christian needed no pressing , but did full justice both to the food and drink , and not least to the latter .
Finally he grew bold , and said that if the king would give him two hundred dollars for it , he was his man to stand sentry next night as well .
When this was arranged , Christian bade him ` Good-day , ' and went down among the guards , and then out into the town along with other soldiers and under-officers .
He had his pocket full of money , and treated them , and drank with them and boasted and made game of the good-for-nothings who were afraid to stand on guard , because they were frightened that the dead princess would eat them .
See whether she had eaten him !
So the day passed in mirth and glee , but when eight o'clock came , Christian was again shut up in the church , all alone .
Before he had been there two hours , he got tired of it , and thought only of getting away .
He found a little door behind the altar which was not locked , and at ten o'clock he slipped out at it , and took to his heels and made for the beach .
He had got half-way thither , when all at once the same little man stood in front of him and said , ` Good evening , Christian , where are you going ? '
` I 've leave to go where I please , ' said the smith , but at the same time he noticed that he could not move a foot .
` No , you have undertaken to keep guard to-night as well , ' said the little man , ` and you must attend to that . '
He then took hold of him , and however unwilling he was , Christian had to go with him right back to the same little door that he had crept out at .
When they got there , the little man said to him , ` Go in front of the altar now , and take in your hand the book that is lying there .
There you shall stay till you hear the lid of the chest slam down over the dead .
In that way you will come to no harm . '
With that the little man shoved him in at the door , and locked it .
Christian then immediately went in front of the altar , and took the book in his hand , and stood thus until the clock struck twelve , and the appearance sprang out of the chest .
` Sentry , where are you ?
Sentry , where are you ? '
it shrieked , and then rushed to the pulpit , and right up into it .
But there was no one there that night .
Then it howled and shrieked again , My father has set no sentry in , War and Pest this night begin .
At the same moment , it noticed the smith standing in front of the altar , and came rushing towards him .
` Are you there ? '
it screamed ; ` now I 'll catch you . '
But it could not come up over the step in front of the altar , and there it continued to howl , and scream , and threaten , until the clock struck one , when it had to go into the chest again , and Christian heard the lid slam above it .
That night , however , it had not the same appearance as on the previous one ; it was less ugly .
When all was quiet in the church , the smith lay down before the altar and slept calmly till the following morning , when the colonel came to fetch him .
He was taken up to the king again , and things went on as the day before .
He got his money , but would give no explanation whether he had seen the king 's daughter , and he would not take the post again , he said .
But after he had got a good breakfast , and tasted well of the king 's wines , he undertook to go on guard again the third night , but he would not do it for less than the half of the kingdom , he said , for it was a dangerous post , and the king had to agree , and promise him this .
The remainder of the day went like the previous one .
He played the boastful soldier , and the merry smith , and he had comrades and boon-companions in plenty .
At eight o'clock he had to put on his uniform again , and was shut up in the church .
He had not been there for an hour before he had come to his senses , and thought , ` It 's best to stop now , while the game is going well . '
The third night , he was sure , would be the worst ; he had been drunk when he promised it , and the half of the kingdom , the king could never have been in earnest about that !
So he decided to leave , without waiting so long as on the previous nights .
In that way he would escape the little man who had watched him before .
All the doors and posterns were locked , but he finally though of creeping up to a window , and opening that , and as the clock struck nine , he crept out there .
It was fairly high in the wall , but he got to the ground with no bones broken , and started to run .
He got down to the shore without meeting anyone , and there he got into a boat , and pushed off from land .
He laughed immensely to himself at the thought of how cleverly he had managed and how he had cheated the little man .
Just then he heard a voice from the shore , ` Good evening , Christian , where are you going ? '
He gave no answer .
` To-night your legs will be too short , ' he thought , and pulled at the oars .
But he then felt something lay hold of the boat , and drag it straight in to shore , for all that he sat and struggled with the oars .
The man then laid hold of him , and said , ` You must remain at your post , as you have promised , ' and whether he liked it or not , Christian had just to go back with him the whole way to the church .
He could never get in at that window again , Christian said ; it was far too high up .
` You must go in there , and you shall go in there , ' said the little man , and with that he lifted him up on to the window-sill .
Then he said to him : ` Notice well now what you have to do .
This evening you must stretch yourself out on the left-hand side of her chest .
The lid opens to the right , and she comes out to the left .
When she has got out of the chest and passed over you , you must get into it and lie there , and that in a hurry , without her seeing you .
There you must remain lying until day dawns , and whether she threatens you or entreats you , you must not come out of it , or give her any answer .
Then she has no power over you , and both you and she are freed . '
The smith then had to go in at the window , just as he came out , and went and laid himself all his length on the left side of the princess 's chest , close up to it , and there he lay stiff as a rock until the clock struck twelve .
Then the lid sprang up to the right , and the princess came out , straight over him , and rushed round the church , howling and shrieking ` Sentry , where are you ?
Sentry , where are you ? '
She went towards the altar , and right up to it , but there was no one there ; then she screamed again , My father has set no sentry in , War and Pest will now begin .
Then she went round the whole church , both up and down , sighing and weeping , My father has set no sentry in , War and Pest will now begin .
Then she went away again , and at the same moment the clock in the tower struck one .
Then the smith heard in the church a soft music , which grew louder and louder , and soon filled the whole building .
He heard also a multitude of footsteps , as if the church was being filled with people .
He heard the priest go through the service in front of the altar , and there was singing more beautiful than he had ever heard before .
Then he also heard the priest offer up a prayer of thanksgiving because the land had been freed from war and pestilence , and from all misfortune , and the king 's daughter delivered from the evil one .
Many voices joined in , and a hymn of praise was sung ; then he heard the priest again , and heard his own name and that of the princess , and thought that he was being wedded to her .
The church was packed full , but he could see nothing .
Then he heard again the many footsteps as ol' folk leaving the church , while the music sounded fainter and fainter , until it altogether died away .
When it was silent , the light of day began to break in through the windows .
The smith sprang up out of the chest and fell on his knees and thanked God .
The church was empty , but up in front of the altar lay the princess , white and red , like a human being , but sobbing and crying , and shaking with cold in her white shroud .
The smith took his sentry coat and wrapped it round her ; then she dried her tears , and took his hand and thanked him , and said that he had now freed her from all the sorcery that had been in her from her birth , and which had come over her again when her father broke the command against seeing her until she had completed her fourteenth year .
She said further , that if he who had delivered her would take her in marriage , she would be his .
If not , she would go into a nunnery , and he could marry no other as long as she lived , for he was wedded to her with the service of the dead , which he had heard .
She was now the most beautiful young princess that anyone could wish to see , and he was now lord of half the kingdom , which had been promised him for standing on guard the third nigh .
So they agreed that they would have each other , and love each other all their days .
With the first sunbeam the watch came and opened the church , and not only was the colonel there , but the king in person , come to see what had happened to the sentinel .
He found them both sitting hand in hand on the step in front of the altar , and immediately knew his daughter again , and took her in his arms , thanking God and her deliverer .
He made no objections to what they had arranged , and so Christian the smith held his wedding with the princess , and got half the kingdom at once , and the whole of it when the king died .
As for the other sentries , with so many doors and windows open , no doubt they had run away , and gone into the Prussian service .
And as for what Christian said he saw , he had been drinking more wine than was good for him .
The Three Brothers Translated from the German of the Brothers Grimm .
There was once a man who had three sons , and no other possessions beyond the house in which he lived .
Now the father loved his three sons equally , so that he could not make up his mind which of them should have the house after his death , because he did not wish to favour any one more than the others .
And he did not want to sell the house , because it had belonged to his family for generations ; otherwise he could have divided the money equally amongst them .
At last an idea struck him , and he said to his sons : ` You must all go out into the world , and look about you , and each learn a trade , and then , when you return , whoever can produce the best masterpiece shall have the house . '
The sons were quite satisfied .
The eldest wished to be a blacksmith , the second a barber , and the third a fencing-master .
They appointed a time when they were to return home , and then they all set out .
It so happened that each found a good master , where he learnt all that was necessary for his trade in the best possible way .
The blacksmith had to shoe the king 's horses , and thought to himself , ` Without doubt the house will be yours ! '
The barber shaved the best men in the kingdom , and he , too , made sure that the house would be his .
The fencing-master received many a blow , but he set his teeth , and would not allow himself to be troubled by them , for he thought to himself , ` If you are afraid of a blow you will never get the house . '
When the appointed time had come the three brothers met once more , and they sat down and discussed the best opportunity of showing off their skill .
Just then a hare came running across the field towards them .
` Look ! '
said the barber , ` here comes something in the nick of time ! '
seized basin and soap , made a lather whilst the hare was approaching , and then , as it ran at full tilt , shaved its moustaches , without cutting it or injuring a single hair on its body . '
I like that very much indeed , ' said the father .
` Unless the others exert themselves to the utmost , the house will be yours . '
Soon after they saw a man driving a carriage furiously towards them .
` Now , father , you shall see what I can do ! '
said the blacksmith , and he sprang after the carriage , tore off the four shoes of the horse as it was going at the top of its speed , and shod it with four new ones without checking its pace .
` You are a clever fellow ! '
said the father , ` and know your trade as well as your brother .
I really do n't know to which of you I shall give the house . '
Then the third son said , ` Father , let me also show you something ; ' and , as it was beginning to rain , he drew his sword and swung it in cross cuts above his head , so that not a drop fell on him , and the rain fell heavier and heavier , till at last it was coming down like a waterspout , but he swung his sword faster and faster , and kept as dry as if he were under cover .
When the father saw this he was astonished , and said , ` You have produced the greatest masterpiece : the house is yours . '
Both the other brothers were quite satisfied , and praised him too , and as they were so fond of each other they all three remained at home and plied their trades : and as they were so experienced and skilful they earned a great deal of money .
So they lived happily together till they were quite old , and when one was taken ill and died the two others were so deeply grieved that they were also taken ill and died too .
And so , because they had all been so clever , and so fond of each other , they were all laid in one grave .
The Snow-queen Translated from the German of Hans Andersen by Miss Alma Alleyne .
There was once a dreadfully wicked hobgoblin .
One day he was in capital spirits because he had made a looking-glass which reflected everything that was good and beautiful in such a way that it dwindled almost to nothing , but anything that was bad and ugly stood out very clearly and looked much worse .
The most beautiful landscapes looked like boiled spinach , and the best people looked repulsive or seemed to stand on their heads with no bodies ; their faces were so changed that they could not be recognised , and if anyone had a freckle you might be sure it would be spread over the nose and mouth .
That was the best part of it , said the hobgoblin .
But one day the looking-glass was dropped , and it broke into a million-billion and more pieces .
And now came the greatest misfortune of all , for each of the pieces was hardly as large as a grain of sand and they flew about all over the world , and if anyone had a bit in his eye there it stayed , and then he would see everything awry , or else could only see the bad sides of a case .
For every tiny splinter of the glass possessed the same power that the whole glass had .
Some people got a splinter in their hearts , and that was dreadful , for then it began to turn into a lump of ice .
The hobgoblin laughed till his sides ached , but still the tiny bits of glass flew about .
And now we will hear all about it .
In a large town , where there were so many people and houses that there was not room enough for everybody to have gardens , lived two poor children .
They were not brother and sister , but they loved each other just as much as if they were .
Their parents lived opposite one another in two attics , and out on the leads they had put two boxes filled with flowers .
There were sweet peas in it , and two rose trees , which grow beautifully , and in summer the two children were allowed to take their little chairs and sit out under the roses .
Then they had splendid games .
In the winter they could not do this , but then they put hot pennies against the frozen window-panes , and made round holes to look at each other through .
His name was Kay , and hers was Gerda .
Outside it was snowing fast .
` Those are the white bees swarming , ' said the old grandmother .
` Have they also a queen bee ? '
asked the little boy , for he knew that the real bees have one .
` To be sure , ' said the grandmother .
` She flies wherever they swarm the thickest .
She is larger than any of them , and never stays upon the earth , but flies again up into the black clouds .
Often at midnight she flies through the streets , and peeps in at all the windows , and then they freeze in such pretty patterns and look like flowers . '
` Yes , we have seen that , ' said both children ; they knew that it was true .
` Can the Snow-queen come in here ? '
asked the little girl .
` Just let her ! '
cried the boy , ' I would put her on the stove , and melt her ! '
But the grandmother stroked his hair , and told some more stories .
In the evening , when little Kay was going to bed , he jumped on the chair by the window , and looked through the little hole .
A few snow-flakes were falling outside , and one of the , the largest , lay on the edge of one of the window-boxes .
The snow-flake grew larger and larger till it took the form of a maiden , dressed in finest white gauze .
She was so beautiful and dainty , but all of ice , hard bright ice .
Still she was alive ; her eyes glittered like two clear stars , but there was no rest or peace in them .
She nodded at the window , and beckoned with her hand .
The little boy was frightened , and sprang down from the chair .
It seemed as if a great white bird had flown past the window .
The next day there was a harder frost than before .
Then came the spring , then the summer , when the roses grew and smelt more beautifully than ever .
Kay and Gerda were looking at one of their picture-books -- the clock in the great church-tower had just struck five , when Kay exclaimed , ` Oh !
something has stung my heart , and I 've got something in my eye ! '
The little girl threw her arms round his neck ; he winked hard with both his eyes ; no , she could see nothing in them . '
I think it is gone now , ' said he ; but it had not gone .
It was one of the tiny splinters of the glass of the magic mirror which we have heard about , that turned everything great and good reflected in it small and ugly .
And poor Kay had also a splinter in his heart , and it began to change into a lump of ice .
It did not hurt him at all , but the splinter was there all the same .
` Why are you crying ? '
he asked ; ` it makes you look so ugly !
There 's nothing the matter with me .
Just look !
that rose is all slug-eaten , and this one is stunted !
What ugly roses they are ! '
And he began to pull them to pieces .
` Kay , what are you doing ? '
cried the little girl .
And when he saw how frightened she was , he pulled off another rose , and ran in at his window away from dear little Gerda .
When she came later on with the picture book , he said that it was only fit for babies , and when his grandmother told them stories , he was always interrupting with , ` But -- ' and then he would get behind her and put on her spectacles , and speak just as she did .
This he did very well , and everybody laughed .
Very soon he could imitate the way all the people in the street walked and talked .
His games were now quite different .
On a winter 's day he would take a burning glass and hold it out on his blue coat and let the snow-flakes fall on it .
` Look in the glass , Gerda !
Just see how regular they are !
They are much more interesting than real flowers .
Each is perfect ; they are all made according to rule .
If only they did not melt ! '
One morning Kay came out with his warm gloves on , and his little sledge hung over his shoulder .
He shouted to Gerda , ' I am going to the market-place to play with the other boys , ' and away he went .
In the market-place the boldest boys used often to fasten their sledges to the carts of the farmers , and then they got a good ride .
When they were in the middle of their games there drove into the square a large sledge , all white , and in it sat a figure dressed in a rough white fur pelisse with a white fur cap on .
The sledge drove twice round the square , and Kay fastened his little sledge behind it and drove off .
It went quicker and quicker into the next street .
The driver turned round , and nodded to Kay ina friendly way as if they had known each other before .
Every time that Kay tried to unfasten his sledge the driver nodded again , and Kay sat still once more .
Then they drove out of the town , and the snow began to fall so thickly that the little boy could not see his hand before him , and on and on they went .
He quickly unfastened the cord to get loose from the big sledge , but it was of no use ; his little sledge hung on fast , and it went on like the wind .
Then he cried out , but nobody heard him .
He was dreadfully frightened .
The snowflakes grew larger and larger till they looked like great white birds .
All at once they flew aside , the large sledge stood still , and the figure who was driving stood up .
The fur cloak and cap were all of snow .
It was a lady , tall and slim , and glittering .
It was the Snow-queen .
` We have come at a good rate , ' she said ; ` but you are almost frozen .
Creep in under my cloak . '
And she set him close to her in the sledge and drew the cloak over him .
He felt as though he were sinking into a snow-drift .
` Are you cold now ? '
she asked , and kissed his forehead .
The kiss was cold as ice and reached down to his heart , which was already half a lump of ice .
` My sledge !
Do n't forget my sledge ! '
He thought of that first , and it was fastened to one of the great white birds who flew behind with the sledge on its back .
The Snow-queen kissed Kay again , and then he forgot all about little Gerda , his grandmother , and everybody at home .
` Now I must not kiss you any more , ' she said , ` or else I should kiss you to death . '
Then away they flew over forests and lakes , over sea and land .
Round them whistled the cold wind , the wolves howled , and the snow hissed ; over them flew the black shrieking crows .
But high up the moon shone large and bright , and thus Kay passed the long winter night .
In the day he slept at the Snow-queen 's feet .
But what happened to little Gerda when Kay did not come back ?
What had become of him ?
Nobody knew .
The other boys told how they had seen him fasten his sledge on to a large one which had driven out of the town gate .
Gerda cried a great deal .
The winter was long and dark to her .
Then the spring came with warm sunshine . '
I will go and look for Kay , ' said Gerda .
So she went down to the river and got into a little boat that was there .
Presently the stream began to carry it away .
` Perhaps the river will take me to Kay , ' thought Gerda .
She glided down , past trees and fields , till she came to a large cherry garden , in which stood a little house with strange red and blue windows and a straw roof .
Before the door stood two wooden soldiers , who were shouldering arms .
Gerda called to them , but they naturally did not answer .
The river carried the boat on to the land .
Gerda called out still louder , and there came out of the house a very old woman .
She leant upon a crutch , and she wore a large sun-hat which was painted with the most beautiful flowers .
` You poor little girl ! '
said the old woman .
And then she stepped into the water , brought the boat in close with her crutch , and lifted little Gerda out .
` And now come and tell me who you are , and how you came here , ' she said .
Then Gerda told her everything , and asked her if she had seen Kay .
But she said he had not passed that way yet , but he would soon come .
She told Gerda not to be sad , and that she should stay with her and take of the cherry trees and flowers , which were better than any picture-bok , as they could each tell a story .
She then took Gerda 's hand and led her into the little house and shut the door .
The windows were very high , and the panes were red , blue , and yellow , so that the light came through in curious colours .
On the table were the most delicious cherries , and the old woman let Gerda eat as many as she liked , while she combed her hair with a gold comb as she ate .
The beautiful sunny hair rippled and shone round the dear little face , which was so soft and sweet . '
I have always longed to have a dear little girl just like you , and you shall see how happy we will be together . '
And as she combed Gerda 's hair , Gerda thought less and less about Kay , for the old woman was a witch , but not a wicked witch , for she only enchanted now and then to amuse herself , and she did want to keep little Gerda very much .
So she went into the garden and waved her stick over all the rose bushes and blossoms and all ; they sank down into the black earth , and no one could see where they had been .
The old woman was afraid that if Gerda saw the roses she would begin to think about her own , and then would remember Kay and run away .
Then she led Gerda out into the garden .
How glorious it was , and what lovely scents filled the air !
All the flowers you can think of blossomed there all the year round .
Gerda jumped for joy and played there till the sun set behind the tall cherry trees , and then she slept in a beautiful bed with red silk pillows filled with violets , and she slept soundly and dreamed as a queen does on her wedding day .
The next day she played again with the flowers in the warm sunshine , and so many days passed by .
Gerda knew every flower , but although there were so many , it seemed to her as if one were not there , though she could not remember which .
She was looking one day at the old woman 's sun-hat which had hte painted flowers on it , and there she saw a rose .
The witch had forgotten to make that vanish when she had made the other roses disappear under the earth .
it was so difficult to think of everything .
` Why , there are no roses here ! '
cried Gerda , , and she hunted amongst all the flowers , but not one was to be found .
Then she sat down and cried , but her tears fell just on the spot where a rose bush had sunk , and when her warm tears watered the earth , the bush came up in full bloom just as it had been before .
Gerda kissed the roses and thought of the lovely roses at home , and with them came the thought of little Kay .
` Oh , what have I been doing ! '
said the little girl . '
I wanted to look for Kay . '
She ran to the end of the garden .
The gate was shut , but she pushed against the rusty lock so that it came open .
She ran out with her little bare feet .
No one came after her .
At last she could not run any longer , and she sat down on a large stone .
When she looked round she saw that the summer was over ; it was late autumn .
It had not changed in the beautiful garden , where were sunshine and flowers all the year round .
` Oh , dear , how late I have made myself ! '
said Gerda .
` It 's autumn already !
I can not rest ! '
And she sprang up to run on .
Oh , how tired and sore her little feet grew , and it became colder and colder .
She had to rest again , and there on the snow in front of her was a large crow .
It had been looking at her for some time , and it nodded its head and said , ` Caw !
caw !
good day . '
Then it asked the little girl why she was alone in the world .
She told the crow her story , and asked if he had seen Kay .
The crow nodded very thoughtfully and said , ` It might be !
It might be ! '
` What !
Do you think you have ? '
cried the little girl , and she almost squeezed the crow to death as she kissed him .
` Gently , gently ! '
said the crow . '
I think -- I know I think -- it might be little Kay , but now he has forgotten you for the princess ! '
` Does he live with a princess ? '
asked Gerda .
` Yes , listen , ' said the crow .
Then he told her all he knew .
` In the kingdom in which we are now sitting lives a princess who is dreadfully clever .
She has read all the newspapers in the world and has forgotten them again .
She is as clever as that .
The other day she came to the throne , and that is not so pleasant as people think .
Then she began to say , `` Why should I not marry ? ''
But she wanted a husband who could answer when he was spoken to , not one who would stand up stiffly and look respectable -- that would be too dull .
` When she told all the Court ladies , they were delighted .
You can believe every word I say , ' said the crow , ' I have a tame sweetheart in the palace , and she tells me everything . '
Of course his sweetheart was a crow .
` The newspapers came out next morning with a border of hearts round it , and the princess 's monogram on it , and inside you could read that every good-looking young man might come into the palace and speak to the princess , and whoever should speak loud enough to be heard would be well fed and looked after , and the one who spoke best should become the princess 's husband .
Indeed , ' said the crow , ` you can quite believe me .
It is as true as that I am sitting here .
` Young men came in streams , and there was such a crowding and a mixing together !
But nothing came of it on the first nor on the second day .
They could all speak quite well when they were in the street , but as soon as they came inside the palace door , and saw the guards in silver , and upstairs the footmen in gold , and the great hall all lighted up , then their wits left them !
And when they stood in front of the throne where the princess was sitting , then they could not think of anything to say except to repeat the last word she had spoken , and she did not much care to hear that again .
It seemed as if they were walking in their sleep until they came out into the street again , when they could speak once more .
There was a row stretching from the gate of the town up to the castle .
` They were hungry and thirsty , but in the palace they did not even get a glass of water . '
A few of the cleverest had brought some slices of bread and butter with them , but they did not share them with their neighbour , for they thought , `` If he looks hungry , the princess will not take him ! '' '
` But what about Kay ? '
asked Gerda .
` When did he come ?
Was he in the crowd ? '
` Wait a bit ; we are coming to him !
On the third day a little figure came without horse or carriage and walked jauntily up to the palace .
His eyes shone as yours do ; he had lovely curling hair , but quite poor clothes . '
` That was Kay ! '
cried Gerda with delight .
` Oh , then I have found him ! '
and she clapped her hands .
` He had a little bundle on his back , ' said the crow .
` No , it must have been his skates , for he went away with his skates ! '
` Very likely , ' said the crow , ' I did not see for certain .
But I know this from my sweetheart , that when he came to the palace door and saw the royal guards in silver , and on the stairs the footmen in gold , he was not the least bit put out .
He nodded to them , saying , `` It must be rather dull standing on the stairs ; I would rather go inside ! ''
` The halls blazed with lights ; councillors and ambassadors were walking about in noiseless shoes carrying gold dishes .
It was enough to make one nervous !
His boots creaked dreadfully loud , but he was not frightened . '
` That must be Kay ! '
said Gerda . '
I know he had new boots on ; I have heard them creaking in his grandmother 's room ! '
` They did creak , certainly ! '
said the crow .
` And , not one bit afraid , up he went to the princess , who was sitting on a large pearl as round as a spinning wheel .
All the ladies-in-waiting were standing round , each with their attendants , and the lords-in-waiting with their attendants .
The nearer they stood to the door the prouder they were . '
` It must have been dreadful ! '
said little Gerda .
` And Kay did win the princess ? ' '
I heard from my tame sweetheart that he was merry and quick-witted ; he had not come to woo , he said , but to listen to the princess 's wisdom .
And the end of it was that they fell in love with each other . '
` Oh , yes ; that was Kay ! '
said Gerda .
` He was so clever ; he could do sums with fractions .
Oh , do lead me to the palace ! '
` That 's easily said ! '
answered the crow , ` but how are we to manage that ?
I must talk it over with my tame sweetheart .
She may be able to advise us , for I must tell you that a little girl like you could never get permission to enter it . '
` Yes , I will get it ! '
said Gerda .
` When Kay hears that I am there he will come out at once and fetch me ! '
` Wait for me by the railings , ' said the crow , and he nodded his head and flew away .
It was late in the evening when he came back .
` Caw , caw ! '
he said , ' I am to give you her love , and here is a little roll for you .
She took it out of the kitchen ; there 's plenty there , and you must be hungry .
You can not come into the palace .
The guards in silver and the footmen in gold would not allow it .
But do n't cry !
You shall get in all right .
My sweetheart knows a little back-stairs which leads to the sleeping-room , and she knows where to find the key . '
They went into the garden , and when the lights in the palace were put out one after the other , the crow led Gerda to a back-door .
Oh , how Gerda 's heart beat with anxiety and longing !
It seemed as if she were going to do something wrong , but she only wanted to know if it were little Kay .
Yes , it must be he !
She remembered so well his clever eyes , his curly hair .
She could see him smiling as he did when they were at home under the rose trees !
He would be so pleased to see her , and to hear how they all were at home .
Now they were on the stairs ; a little lamp was burning , and on the landing stood the tame crow .
She put her head on one side and looked at Gerda , who bowed as her grandmother had taught her .
` My betrothed has told me many nice things about you , my dear young lady , ' she said .
` Will you take the lamp while I go in front ?
We go this way so as to meet no one . '
Through beautiful rooms they came to the sleeping-room .
In the middle of it , hung on a thick rod of gold , were two beds , shaped like lilies , one all white , in which lay the princess , and the other red , in which Gerda hoped to find Kay .
She pushed aside the curtain , and saw a brown neck .
Oh , it was Kay !
She called his name out loud , holding the lamp towards him .
He woke up , turned his head and -- it was not Kay !
It was only his neck that was like Kay 's , but he was young and handsome .
The princess sat up in her lily-bed and asked who was there .
Then Gerda cried , and told her story and all that the crows had done .
` You poor child ! '
said the prince and princess , and they praised the crows , and said that they were not angry with them , but that they must not do it again .
Now they should have a reward .
` Would you like to fly away free ? '
said the princess , ` or will you have a permanent place as court crows with what you can get in the kitchen ? '
And both crows bowed and asked for a permanent appointment , for they thought of their old age .
And they put Gerda to bed , and she folded her hands , thinking , as she fell asleep , ` How good people and animals are to me ! '
The next day she was dressed from head to foot in silk and satin .
They wanted her to stay on in the palace , but she begged for a little carriage and a horse , and a pair of shoes so that she might go out again into the world to look for Kay .
They gave her a muff as well as some shoes ; she was warmly dressed , and when she was ready , there in front of the door stood a coach of pure gold , with a coachman , footmen and postilions with gold crowns on .
The prince and princess helped her into the carriage and wished her good luck .
The wild crow who was now married drove with her for the first three miles ; the other crow could not come because she had a bad headache .
` Good-bye , good-bye ! '
called the prince and princess ; and little Gerda cried , and the crow cried .
When he said good-bye , he flew on to a tree and waved with his black wings as long as the carriage , which shone like the sun , was in sight .
They came at last to a dark wood , but the coach lit it up like a torch .
When the robbers saw it , they rushed out , exclaiming , ` Gold !
gold ! '
They seized the horses , killed the coachman , footmen and postilions , and dragged Gerda out of the carriage .
` She is plump and tender !
I will eat her ! '
said the old robber-queen , and she drew her long knife , which glittered horribly .
` You shall not kill her ! '
cried her little daughter .
` She shall play with me .
She shall give me her muff and her beautiful dress , and she shall sleep in my bed . '
The little robber-girl was as big as Gerda , but was stronger , broader , with dark hair and black eyes .
She threw her arms round Gerda and said , ` They shall not kill you , so long as you are not naughty .
Are n't you a princess ? '
` No , ' said Gerda , and she told all that had happened to her , and how dearly she loved little Kay .
The robber-girl looked at her very seriously , and nodded her head , saying , ` They shall not kill you , even if you are naughty , for then I will kill you myself ! '
And she dried Gerda 's eyes , and stuck both her hands in the beautiful warm muff .
The little robber-girl took Gerda to a corner of the robbers ' camp where she slept .
All round were more than a hundred wood-pigeons which seemed to be asleep , but they moved a little when the two girls came up .
There was also , near by , a reindeer which the robber-girl teased by tickling it with her long sharp knife .
Gerda lay awake for some time .
` Coo , coo ! '
said the wood-pigeons .
` We have seen little Kay .
A white bird carried his sledge ; he was sitting in the Snow-queen 's carriage which drove over the forest when our little ones were in the nest .
She breathed on them , and all except we two died .
Coo , coo ! '
` What are you saying over there ? '
cried Gerda .
` Where was the Snow-queen going to ?
Do you know at all ? '
` She was probably travelling to Lapland , where there is always ice and snow .
Ask the reindeer . '
` There is capital ice and snow there ! '
said the reindeer .
` One can jump about there in the great sparkling valleys .
There the Snow-queen has her summer palace , but her best palace is up by the North Pole , on the island called Spitzbergen . ' '
O Kay , my little Kay ! '
sobbed Gerda .
` You must lie still , ' said the little robber-girl , ` or else I shall stick my knife into you ! '
In the morning Gerda told her all that the wood-pigeons had said .
She nodded .
` Do you know where Lapland is ? '
she asked the reindeer .
` Who should know better than I ? '
said the beast , and his eyes sparkled . '
I was born and bred there on the snow-fields . '
` Listen ! '
said the robber-girl to Gerda ; ` you see that all the robbers have gone ; only my mother is left , and she will fall asleep in the afternoon -- then I will do something for you ! '
When her mother had fallen asleep , the robber-girl went up to the reindeer and said , ' I am going to set you free so that you can run to Lapland .
But you must go quickly and carry this little girl to the Snow-queen 's palace , where her playfellow is .
You must have heard all that she told about it , for she spoke loud enough ! '
The reindeer sprang high for joy .
The robber-girl lifted little Gerda up , and had the foresight to tie her on firmly , and even gave her a little pillow for a saddle .
` You must have your fur boots , ' she said , ` for it will be cold ; but I shall keep your muff , for it is so cosy !
But , so that you may not freeze , here are my mother 's great fur gloves ; they will come up to your elbows .
Creep into them ! '
And Gerda cried for joy .
` Do n't make such faces ! '
said the little robber-girl .
` You must look very happy .
And here are two loaves and a sausage ; now you wo n't be hungry ! '
They were tied to the reindeer , the little robber-girl opened the door , made all the big dogs come away , cut through the halter with her sharp knife , and said to the reindeer , ` Run now !
But take great care of the little girl . '
And Gerda stretched out her hands with the large fur gloves towards the little robber-girl and said , ` Good-bye ! '
Then the reindeer flew over the ground , through the great forest , as fast as he could .
The wolves howled , the ravens screamed , the sky seemed on fire .
` Those are my dear old northern lights , ' said the reindeer ; ` see how they shine ! '
And then he ran faster still , day and night .
The loaves were eaten , and the sausage also , and then they came to Lapland .
They stopped by a wretched little house ; the roof almost touched the ground , and the door was so low that you had to creep in and out .
There was no one in the house except an old Lapland woman who was cooking fish over an oil-lamp .
The reindeer told Gerda 's whole history , but first he told his own , for that seemed to him much more important , and Gerda was so cold that she could not speak .
` Ah , you poor creatures ! '
said the Lapland woman ; ` you have still further to go !
You must go over a hundred miles into Finland , for there the Snow-queen lives , and every night she burns Bengal lights .
I will write some words on a dried stock-fish , for I have no paper , and you must give it to the Finland woman , for she can give you better advice than I can . '
And when Gerda was warmed and had had something to eat and drink , the Lapland woman wrote on a dried stock-fish , and begged Gerda to take care of it , tied Gerda securely on the reindeer 's back , and away they went again .
The whole night was ablaze with northern lights , and then they came to Finland and knocked at the Finland woman 's chimney , for door she had none .
Inside it was so hot that the Finland woman wore very few clothes ; she loosened Gerda 's clothes and drew off her fur gloves and boots .
She laid a piece of ice on the reindeer 's head , and then read what was written on the stock-fish .
She read it over three times till she knew it by heart , and then put the fish in the saucepan , for she never wasted anything .
Then the reindeer told his story , and afterwards little Gerda 's and the Finland woman blinked her eyes but said nothing .
` You are very clever , ' said the reindeer . '
I know .
Can not you give the little girl a drink so that she may have the strength of twelve men and overcome the Snow-queen ? '
` The strength of twelve men ! '
said the Finland woman ; ` that would not help much .
Little Kay is with the Snow-queen and he likes everything there very much and thinks it the best place in the world .
But that is because he has a splinter of glass in his heart and a bit in his eye .
If these do not come out , he will never be free , and the Snow-queen will keep her power over him . '
` But can not you give little Gerda something so that she can have power over her ? ' '
I can give her no greater power than she has already ; do n't you see how great it is ?
Do n't you see how men and beasts must help her when she wanders into the wide world with her bare feet ?
She is powerful already , because she is a dear little innocent child .
If she can not by herself conquer the Snow-queen and take away the glass splinters from little Kay , we can not help her !
The Snow-queen 's garden begins two miles from here .
You can carry the little maiden so far ; put her down by the large bush with red berries growing in the snow .
Then you must come back here as fast as you can . '
Then the Finland woman lifted little Gerda on the reindeer and away he sped .
` Oh , I have left my gloves and boots behind ! '
cried Gerda .
She missed them in the piercing cold , but the reindeer did not dare to stop .
On he ran till he came to the bush with red berries .
Then he set Gerda down and kissed her mouth , and great big tears ran down his cheeks , and then he ran back .
There stood poor Gerda , without shoes or gloves in the middle of the bitter cold of Finland .
She ran on as fast as she could .
A regiment of gigantic snowflakes came against her , but they melted when they touched her , and she went on with fresh courage .
And now we must see what Kay was doing .
He was not thinking of Gerda , and never dreamt that she was standing outside the palace .
The walls of the palace were built of driven snow , and the doors and windows of piercing winds .
There were more than a hundred halls in it all of frozen snow .
The largest was several miles long ; the bright Northern lights lit them up , and very large and empty and cold and glittering they were !
In the middle of the great hall was a frozen lake which had cracked in a thousand pieces ; each piece was exactly like the other .
Here the Snow-queen used to sit when she was at home .
Little Kay was almost blue and black with cold , but he did not feel it , for she had kissed away his feelings and his heart was a lump of ice .
He was pulling about some sharp , flat pieces of ice , and trying to fit one into the other .
He thought each was most beautiful , but that was because of the splinter of glass in his eye .
He fitted them into a great many shapes , but he wanted to make them spell the word ` Love . '
The Snow-queen had said , ` If you can spell out that word you shalt be your own master .
I will give you the whole world and a new pair of skates . '
But he could not do it .
` Now I must fly to warmer countries , ' said the Snow-queen . '
I must go and powder my black kettles ! '
-LRB- This was what she called Mount Etna and Mount Vesuvius . -RRB-
` It does the lemons and grapes good . '
And off she flew , and Kay sat alone in the great hall trying to do his puzzle .
He sat so still that you would have thought he was frozen .
Then it happened that little Gerda stepped into the hall .
The biting cold winds became quiet as if they had fallen asleep when she appeared in the great , empty , freezing hall .
She caught sight of Kay ; she recognised him , and ran and put her arms round his neck , crying , ` Kay !
dear little Kay !
I have found you at last ! '
But he sat quite still and cold .
Then Gerda wept hot tears which fell on his neck and thawed his heart and swept away the bit of the looking-glass .
He looked at her and then he burst into tears .
He cried so much that the glass splinter swam out of his eye ; then he knew her , and cried out , ` Gerda !
dear little Gerda !
Where have you been so long ?
and where have I been ? '
And he looked round him .
` How cold it is here !
How wide and empty ! '
and he threw himself on Gerda , and she laughed and wept for joy .
It was such a happy time that the pieces of ice even danced round them for joy , and when they were tired and lay down again they formed themselves into the letters that the Snow-queen had said he must spell in order to become his own master and have the whole world and a new pair of skates .
And Gerda kissed his cheeks and they grew rosy ; she kissed his eyes and they sparkled like hers ; she kissed his hands and feet and he became warm and glowing .
The Snow-queen might come home now ; his release -- the word ` Love ' -- stood written in sparkling ice .
They took each other 's hands and wandered out of the great palace ; they talked about the grandmother and the roses on the leads , wherever they came the winds hushed and the sun came out .
When they reached the bush with red berries there stood the reindeer waiting for them .
He carried Kay and Gerda first to the Finland woman , who warmed them in her hot room and gave them advice for their journey home .
Then they went to the Lapland woman , who gave them new clothes and mended their sleigh .
The reindeer ran with them until they came to the green fields fresh with the spring green .
Here he said good-bye .
They came to the forest , which was bursting into bud , and out of it came a splendid horse which Gerda knew ; it was the one which had drawn the gold coach ridden by a young girl with a red cap on and pistols in her belt .
It was the little robber girl who was tired of being at home and wanted to go out into the world .
She and Gerda knew each other at once .
` You are a nice fellow ! '
she said to Kay . '
I should like to know if you deserve to be run all over the world ! '
But Gerda patted her cheeks and asked after the prince and princess .
` They are travelling about , ' said the robber girl .
` And the crow ? '
asked Gerda .
` Oh , the crow is dead ! '
answered the robber-girl .
` His tame sweetheart is a widow and hops about with a bit of black crape round her leg .
She makes a great fuss , but that 's all nonsense .
But tell me what happened to you , and how you caught him . '
And Kay and Gerda told her all .
` Dear , dear ! '
said the robber-girl , shook both their hands , and promised that if she came to their town she would come and see them .
Then she rode on .
But Gerda and Kay went home hand in hand .
There they found the grandmother and everything just as it had been , but when they went through the doorway they found they were grown-up .
There were the roses on the leads ; it was summer , warm , glorious summer .
The Fir-tree Translated from the German of Hans Christian Andersen .
There was once a pretty little fir-tree in a wood .
It was in a capital position , for it could get sun , and there was enough air , and all around grew many tall companions , both pines and firs .
It did not heed the warm sun and the fresh air , or notice the little peasant children who ran about chattering when they came out to gather wild strawberries and raspberries .
Often they found a whole basketful and strung strawberries on a straw ; they would sit down by the little fir-tree and say , ` What a pretty little one this is ! '
The tree did not like that at all .
By the next year it had grown a whole ring taller , and the year after that another ring more , for you can always tell a fir-tree 's age from its rings .
` Oh !
if I were only a great tree like the others ! '
sighed the little fir-tree , ` then I could stretch out my branches far and wide and look out into the great world !
The birds would build their nests in my branches , and when the wind blew I would bow to it politely just like the others ! '
It took no pleasure in the sunshine , nor in the birds , nor in the rose-coloured clouds that sailed over it at dawn and at sunset .
Then the winter came , and the snow lay white and sparkling all around , and a hare would come and spring right over the little fir-tree , which annoyed it very much .
But when two more winters had passed the fir-tree was so tall that the hare had to run round it .
` Ah !
to grow and grow , and become great and old !
that is the only pleasure in life , ' thought the tree .
In the autumn the woodcutters used to come and hew some of the tallest trees ; this happened every year , and the young fir-tree would shiver as the magnificent trees fell crashing and crackling to the ground , their branches hewn off , and the great trunks left bare , so that they were almost unrecognisable .
But then they were laid on waggons and dragged out of the wood by horses .
` Where are they going ?
What will happen to them ? '
In spring , when the swallows and storks came , the fir-tree asked them , ` Do you know where they were taken ?
Have you met them ? '
The swallows knew nothing of them , but the stork nodded his head thoughtfully , saying , ' I think I know .
I met many new ships as I flew from Egypt ; there were splendid masts on the ships .
I 'll wager those were they !
They had the scent of fir-trees .
Ah !
those are grand , grand ! '
` Oh !
if I were only big enough to sail away over the sea too !
What sort of thing is the sea ?
what does it look like ? '
` Oh !
it would take much too long to tell you all that , ' said the stork , and off he went .
` Rejoice in your youth , ' said the sunbeams , ` rejoice in the sweet growing time , in the young life within you . '
And the wind kissed it and the dew wept tears over it , but the fir-tree did not understand .
Towards Christmas-time quite little trees were cut down , some not as big as the young fir-tree , or just the same age , and now it had no peace or rest for longing to be away .
These little trees , which were chosen for their beauty , kept all their branches ; they were put in carts and drawn out of the wood by horses .
` Whither are those going ? '
asked the fir-tree ; ` they are no bigger than I , and one there was much smaller even !
Why do they keep their branches ?
Where are they taken to ? '
` We know !
we know ! '
twittered the sparrows .
` Down there in the city we have peeped in at the windows , we know where they go !
They attain to the greatest splendour and magnificence you can imagine !
We have looked in at the windows and seen them planted in the middle of the warm room and adorned with the most beautiful things-golden apples , sweet-meats , toys and hundreds of candles . '
` And then ? '
asked the fir-tree , trembling in every limb with eagerness , ` and then ?
what happens then ? '
` Oh , we have n't seen anything more than that .
That was simply matchless ! '
` Am I too destined to the same brilliant career ? '
wondered the fir-tree excitedly .
` That is even better than sailing over the sea !
I am sick with longing .
If it were only Christmas !
Now I am tall and grown-up like those which were taken away last year .
Ah , if I were only in the cart !
If I were only in the warm room with all the splendour and magnificence !
And then ?
Then comes something better , something still more beautiful , else why should they dress us up ?
There must be something greater , something grander to come -- but what ?
Oh !
I am pining away !
I really do n't know what 's the matter with me ! '
` Rejoice in us , ' said the air and sunshine , ` rejoice in your fresh youth in the free air ! '
But it took no notice , and just grew and grew ; there it stood fresh and green in winter and summer , and all who saw it said , ` What a beautiful tree ! '
And at Christmas-time it was the first to be cut down .
The axe went deep into the pith ; the tree fell to the ground with a groan ; it felt bruised and faint .
It could not think of happiness , it was sad at leaving its home , the spot where it had sprung up ; it knew , too , that it would never see again its dear old companions , or the little shrubs and flowers , perhaps not even the birds .
Altogether the parting was not pleasant .
When the tree came to itself again it was packed in a yard with other trees , and a man was saying , ` This is a splendid one , we shall only want this . '
Then came two footmen in livery and carried the fir-tree to a large and beautiful room .
There were pictures hanging on the walls , and near the Dutch stove stood great Chinese vases with lions on their lids ; there were armchairs , silk-covered sofas , big tables laden with picture-books and toys , worth hundreds of pounds-at least , so the children said .
The fir-tree was placed in a great tub filled with sand , but no one could see that it was a tub , for it was all hung with greenery and stood on a gay carpet .
How the tree trembled !
What was coming now ?
On its branches they hung little nets cut out of coloured paper , each full of sugarplums ; gilt apples and nuts hung down as if they were growing , over a hundred red , blue , and white tapers were fastened among the branches .
Dolls as life-like as human beings -- the fir-tree had never seen any before were suspended among the green , and right up at the top was fixed a gold tinsel star ; it was gorgeous , quite unusually gorgeous !
` To-night , ' they all said , ` to-night it will be lighted ! '
` Ah ! '
thought the tree , ` if it were only evening !
Then the tapers would soon be lighted .
What will happen then ?
I wonder whether the trees will come from the wood to see me , or if the sparrows will fly against the window panes ?
Am I to stand here decked out thus through winter and summer ? '
It was not a bad guess , but the fir-tree had real bark-ache from sheer longing , and bark-ache in trees is just as bad as head-ache in human beings .
Now the tapers were lighted .
What a glitter !
What splendour !
The tree quivered in all its branches so much , that one of the candles caught the green , and singed it .
` Take care ! '
cried the young ladies , and they extinguished it .
Now the tree did not even dare to quiver .
It was really terrible !
It was so afraid of losing any of its ornaments , and it was quite bewildered by all the radiance .
And then the folding doors were opened , and a crowd of children rushed in , as though they wanted to knock down the whole tree , whilst the older people followed soberly .
The children stood quite silent , but only for a moment , and then they shouted again , and danced round the tree , and snatched off one present after another .
` What are they doing ? '
thought the tree .
` What is going to happen ? '
And the tapers burnt low on the branches , and were put out one by one , and then the children were given permission to plunder the tree .
They rushed at it so that all its boughs creaked ; if it had not been fastened by the gold star at the top to the ceiling , it would have been overthrown .
The children danced about with their splendid toys , and no one looked at the tree , except the old nurse , who came and peeped amongst the boughs , just to see if a fig or an apple had been forgotten . '
A story !
a story ! '
cried the children , and dragged a little stout man to the tree ; he sat down beneath it , saying , ` Here we are in the greenwood , and the tree will be delighted to listen !
But I am only going to tell one story .
Shall it be Henny Penny or Humpty Dumpty who fell downstairs , and yet gained great honour and married a princess ? '
` Henny Penny ! '
cried some ; ` Humpty Dumpty ! '
cried others ; there was a perfect babel of voices !
Only the fir-tree kept silent , and thought , ` Am I not to be in it ?
Am I to have nothing to do with it ? '
But it had already been in it , and played out its part .
And the man told them about Humpty Dumpty who fell downstairs and married a princess .
The children clapped their hands and cried , ` Another !
another ! '
They wanted the story of Henny Penny also , but they only got Humpty Dumpty .
The fir-tree stood quite astonished and thoughtful ; the birds in the wood had never related anything like that .
` Humpty Dumpty fell downstairs and yet married a princess !
yes , that is the way of the world ! '
thought the tree , and was sure it must be true , because such a nice man had told the story .
` Well , who knows ?
Perhaps I shall fall downstairs and marry a princess . '
And it rejoiced to think that next day it would be decked out again with candles , toys , glittering ornaments , and fruits .
` To-morrow I shall quiver again with excitement .
I shall enjoy to the full all my splendour .
To-morrow I shall hear Humpty Dumpty again , and perhaps Henny Penny too . '
And the tree stood silent and lost in thought all through the night .
Next morning the servants came in .
` Now the dressing up will begin again , ' thought the tree .
But they dragged it out of the room , and up the stairs to the lumber-room , and put it in a dark corner , where no ray of light could penetrate .
` What does this mean ? '
thought the tree .
` What am I to do here ?
What is there for me to hear ? '
And it leant against the wall , and thought and thought .
And there was time enough for that , for days and nights went by , and no one came ; at last when some one did come , it was only to put some great boxes into the corner .
Now the tree was quite covered ; it seemed as if it had been quite forgotten .
` Now it is winter out-doors , ' thought the fir-tree .
` The ground is hard and covered with snow , they ca n't plant me yet , and that is why I am staying here under cover till the spring comes .
How thoughtful they are !
Only I wish it were not so terribly dark and lonely here ; not even a little hare !
It was so nice out in the wood , when the snow lay all around , and the hare leapt past me ; yes , even when he leapt over me : but I did n't like it then .
It 's so dreadfully lonely up here . '
` Squeak , squeak ! '
said a little mouse , stealing out , followed by a second .
They sniffed at the fir-tree , and then crept between its boughs .
` It 's frightfully cold , ' said the little mice .
` How nice it is to be here !
Do n't you think so too , you old fir-tree ? '
` I 'm not at all old , ' said the tree ; ` there are many much older than I am . '
` Where do you come from ? '
asked the mice , ` and what do you know ? '
They were extremely inquisitive .
` Do tell us about the most beautiful place in the world .
Is that where you come from ?
Have you been in the storeroom , where cheeses lie on the shelves , and hams hang from the ceiling , where one dances on tallow candles , and where one goes in thin and comes out fat ? ' '
I know nothing about that , ' said the tree .
` But I know the wood , where the sun shines , and the birds sing . '
And then it told them all about its young days , and the little mice had never heard anything like that before , and they listened with all their ears , and said : ` Oh , how much you have seen !
How lucky you have been ! '
` I ? '
said the fir-tree , and then it thought over what it had told them .
` Yes , on the whole those were very happy times . '
But then it went on to tell them about Christmas Eve , when it had been adorned with sweet-meats and tapers .
` Oh ! '
said the little mice , ` how lucky you have been , you old fir-tree ! '
` I 'm not at all old ' said the tree . '
I only came from the wood this winter .
I am only a little backward , perhaps , in my growth . '
` How beautifully you tell stories ! '
said the little mice .
And next evening they came with four others , who wanted to hear the tree 's story , and it told still more , for it remembered everything so clearly and thought : ` Those were happy times !
But they may come again .
Humpty dumpty fell downstairs , and yet he married a princess ; perhaps I shall also marry a princess ! '
And then it thought of a pretty little birch-tree that grew out in the wood , and seemed to the fir-tree a real princess , and a very beautiful one too .
` Who is Humpty Dumpty ? '
asked the little mice .
And then the tree told the whole story ; it could remember every single word , and the little mice were ready to leap on to the topmost branch out of sheer joy !
Next night many more mice came , and on Sunday even two rats ; but they did not care about the story , and that troubled the little mice , for now they thought less of it too .
` Is that the only story you know ? '
asked the rats .
` The only one , ' answered the tree . '
I heard that on my happiest evening , but I did not realise then how happy I was . '
` That 's a very poor story .
Do n't you know one about bacon or tallow candles ?
a storeroom story ? '
` No , ' said the tree .
` Then we are much obliged to you , ' said the rats , and they went back to their friends .
At last the little mice went off also , and the tree said , sighing : ` Really it was very pleasant when the lively little mice sat round and listened whilst I told them stories .
But now that 's over too .
But now I will think of the time when I shall be brought out again , to keep up my spirits . '
But when did that happen ?
Well , it was one morning when they came to tidy up the lumber-room ; they threw it really rather roughly on the floor , but a servant dragged it off at once downstairs , where there was daylight once more .
` Now life begins again ! '
thought the tree .
It felt the fresh air , the first rays of the sun , and there it was out in the yard !
Everything passed so quickly ; the tree quite forgot to notice itself , there was so much to look at all around .
The yard opened on a garden full of flowers ; the roses were so fresh and sweet , hanging over a little trellis , the lime-trees were in blossom , and the swallows flew about , saying : ` Quirre-virre-vil , my husband has come home ; ' but it was not the fir-tree they meant .
` Now I shall live , ' thought the tree joyfully , stretching out its branches wide ; but , alas !
they were all withered and yellow ; and it was lying in a corner among weeds and nettles .
The golden star was still on its highest bough , and it glittered in the bright sunlight .
In the yard some of the merry children were playing , who had danced so gaily round the tree at Christmas .
One of the little ones ran up , and tore off the gold star .
` Look what was left on the ugly old fir-tree ! '
he cried , and stamped on the boughs so that they cracked under his feet .
And the tree looked at all the splendour and freshness of the flowers in the garden , and then looked at itself , and wished that it had been left lying in the dark corner of the lumber-room ; it thought of its fresh youth in the wood , of the merry Christmas Eve , and of the little mice who had listened so happily to the story of Humpty Dumpty .
` Too late !
Too late ! '
thought the old tree .
` If only I had enjoyed myself whilst I could .
Now all is over and gone . '
And a servant came and cut the tree into small pieces , there was quite a bundle of them ; they flickered brightly under the great copper in the brew-house ; the tree sighed deeply , and each sigh was like a pistol-shot ; so the children who were playing there ran up , and sat in front of the fire , gazing at it , and crying , ` Piff !
puff !
bang ! '
But for each report , which was really a sigh , the tree was thinking of a summer 's day in the wood , or of a winter 's night out there , when the stars were shining ; it thought of Christmas Eve , and of Humpty Dumpty , which was the only story it had heard , or could tell , and then the tree had burnt away .
The children played on in the garden , and the youngest had the golden star on his breast , which the tree had worn on the happiest evening of its life ; and now that was past -- and the tree had passed away -- and the story too , all ended and done with .
And that 's the way with all stories !
Here our Danish author ends .
This is what people call sentiment , and I hope you enjoy it !
Hans , the Mermaid 's Son Translated from the Danish .
In a village there once lived a smith called Basmus , who was in a very poor way .
He was still a young man , and a strong handsome fellow to boot , but he had many little children and there was little to be earned by his trade .
He was , however , a diligent and hard-working man , and when he had no work in the smithy he was out at sea fishing , or gathering wreckage on the shore .
It happened one time that he had gone out to fish in good weather , all alone in a little boat , but he did not come home that day , nor the following one , so that all believed he had perished out at sea .
On the third day , however , Basmus came to shore again and had his boat full of fish , so big and fat that no one had ever seen their like .
There was nothing the matter with him , and he complained neither of hunger or thirst .
He had got into a fog , he said , and could not find land again .
What he did not tell , however , was where he had been all the time ; that only came out six years later , when people got to know that he had been caught by a mermaid out on the deep sea , and had been her guest during the three days that he was missing .
From that time forth he went out no more to fish ; nor , indeed , did he require to do so , for whenever he went down to the shore it never failed that some wreckage was washed up , and in it all kinds of valuable things .
In those days everyone took what they found and got leave to keep it , so that the smith grew more prosperous day by day .
When seven years had passed since the smith went out to sea , it happened one morning , as he stood in the smithy , mending a plough , that a handsome young lad came in to him and said , ` Good-day , father ; my mother the mermaid sends her greetings , and says that she has had me for six years now , and you can keep me for as long . '
He was a strange enough boy to be six years old , for he looked as if he were eighteen , and was even bigger and stronger than lads commonly are at that age .
` Will you have a bite of bread ? '
said the smith .
` Oh , yes , ' said Hans , for that was his name .
The smith then told his wife to cut a piece of bread for him .
She did so , and the boy swallowed it at one mouthful and went out again to the smithy to his father .
` Have you got all you can eat ? '
said the smith .
` No , ' said Hans , ` that was just a little bit . '
The smith went into the house and took a whole loaf , which he cut into two slices and put butter and cheese between them , and this he gave to Hans .
In a while the boy came out to the smithy again .
` Well , have you got as much as you can eat ? '
said the smith .
` No , not nearly , ' said Hans ; ' I must try to find a better place than this , for I can see that I shall never get my fill here . '
Hans wished to set off at once , as soon as his father would make a staff for him of such a kind as he wanted .
` It must be of iron , ' said he , ` and one that can hold out . '
The smith brought him an iron rod as thick as an ordinary staff , but Hans took it and twisted it round his finger , so that would n't do .
Then the smith came dragging one as thick as a waggon-pole , but Hans bent it over his knee and broke it like a straw .
The smith then had to collect all the iron he had , and Hans held it while his father forged for him a staff , which was heavier than the anvil .
When Hans had got this he said , ` Many thanks , father ; now I have got my inheritance . '
With this he set off into the country , and the smith was very pleased to be rid of that son , before he ate him out of house and home .
Hans first arrived at a large estate , and it so happened that the squire himself was standing outside the farmyard .
` Where are you going ? '
said the squire . '
I am looking for a place , ' said Hans , ` where they have need of strong fellows , and can give them plenty to eat . '
` Well , ' said the squire , ' I generally have twenty-four men at this time of the year , but I have only twelve just now , so I can easily take you on . '
` Very well , ' said Hans , ' I shall easily do twelve men 's work , but then I must also have as much to eat as the twelve would . '
All this was agreed to , and the squire took Hans into the kitchen , and told the servant girls that the new man was to have as much food as the other twelve .
It was arranged that he should have a pot to himself , and he could then use the ladle to take his food with .
It was in the evening that Hans arrived there , so he did nothing more that day than eat his supper -- a big pot of buck-wheat porridge , which he cleaned to the bottom and was then so far satisfied that he said he could sleep on that , so he went off to bed .
He slept both well and long , and all the rest were up and at their work while he was still sleeping soundly .
The squire was also on foot , for he was curious to see how the new man would behave who was both to eat and work for twelve .
But as yet there was no Hans to be seen , and the sun was already high in the heavens , so the squire himself went and called on him .
` Get up , Hans , ' he cried ; ` you are sleeping too long . '
Hans woke up and rubbed his eyes .
` Yes , that 's true , ' he said , ' I must get up and have my breakfast . '
So he rose and dressed himself , and went into the kitchen , where he got his pot of porridge ; he swallowed all of this , and then asked what work he was to have .
He was to thresh that day , said the squire ; the other twelve men were already busy at it .
There were twelve threshing-floors , and the twelve men were at work on six of them -- two on each .
Hans must thresh by himself all that was lying upon the other six floors .
He went out to the barn and got hold of a flail .
Then he looked to see how the others did it and did the same , but at hte first stroke he smashed the flail in pieces .
There were several flails hanging there , and Hans took the one after the other , but they all went the same way , every one flying in splinters at the first stroke .
He then looked round for something else to work with , and found a pair of strong beams lying near .
Next he caught sight of a horse-hide nailed up on the barn-door .
With the beams he made a flail , using the skin to tie them together .
The one beam he used as a handle , and the other to strike with , and now that was all right .
But the barn was too low , there was no room to swing the flail , and the floors were too small .
Hans , however , found a remedy for this -- he simply lifted the whole roof off the barn , and set it down in the field beside .
He then emptied down all the corn that he could lay his hands on and threshed away .
He went through one lot after another , and it was ll the same to him what he got hold of , so before midday he had threshed all the squire 's grain , his rye and wheat and barley and oats , all mixed through each other .
When he was finished with this , he lifted the roof up on the barn again , like setting a lid on a box , and went in and told the squire that the job was done .
The squire opened his eyes at this announcement ; and came out to see if it was really true .
It was true , sure enough , but he was scarcely delighted with the mixed grain that he got from all his crops .
However , when he saw the flail that Hans had used , and learned how he had made room for himself to swing it , he was so afraid of the strong fellow , that he dared not say anything , except that it was a good thing he had got it threshed ; but it had still to be cleaned .
` What does that mean ? '
asked Hans .
It was explained to him that the corn and the chaff had to be separated ; as yet both were lying in one heap , right up to the roof .
Hans began to take up a little and sift it in his hands , but he soon saw that this would never do .
He soon thought of a plan , however ; he opened both barn-doors , and then lay down at one end and blew , so that all the chaff flew out and lay like a sand-bank at the other end of the barn , and the grain was as clean as it could be .
Then he reported to the squire that that job also was done .
The squire said that that was well ; there was nothing more for him to do that day .
Off went Hans to the kitchen , and got as much as he could eat ; then he went and took a midday nap which lasted till supper-time .
Meanwhile the squire was quite miserable , and made his moan to his wife , saying that she must help him to find some means to getting rid of this strong fellow , for he durst not give him his leave .
She sent for the steward , and it was arranged that next day all the men should go to the forest for fire-wood , and that they should make a bargain among them , that the one who came home last with his load should be hanged .
They thought they could easily manage that it would be Hans who would lose his life , for the others would be early on the road , while Hans would certainly oversleep himself .
In the evening , therefore , the men sat and talked together , saying that next morning they must set out early to the forest , and as they had a hard day 's work and a long journey before them , they would , for their amusement , make a compact , that whichever of them came home last with his load should lose his life on the gallows .
So Hans had no objections to make .
Long before the sun was up next morning , all the twelve men were on foot .
They took all the best horses and carts , and drove off to the forest .
Hans , however , lay and slept on , and the squire said , ` Just let him lie . '
At last , Hans thought it was time to have his breakfast , so he got up and put on his clothes .
He took plenty of time to his breakfast , and then went out to get his horse and cart ready .
The others had taken everything that was any good , so that he had a difficulty in scraping together four wheels of different sizes and fixing them to an old cart , and he could find no other horses than a pair of old hacks .
He did not know where it lay , but he followed the track of the other carts , and in that way came to it all right .
On coming to the gate leading into the forest , he was unfortunate enough to break it in pieces , so he took a huge stone that was lying on the field , seven ells long , and seven ells broad , and set this in the gap , then he went on and joined the others .
These laughed at him heartily , for they had laboured as hard as they could since daybreak , and had helped each other to fell trees and put them on the carts , so that all of these were now loaded except one .
Hans got hold of a woodman 's axe and proceeded to fell a tree , but he destroyed the edge and broke the shaft at the first blow .
He therefore laid down the axe , put his arms round the tree , and pulled it up by the roots .
This he threw upon his cart , and then another and another , and thus he went on while all the others forgot their work , and stood with open mouths , gazing at this strange woodcraft .
All at once they began to hurry ; the last cart was loaded , and they whipped up their horses , so as to be the first to arrive home .
When Hans had finished his work , he again put his old hacks into the cart , but they could not move it from the spot .
He was annoyed at this , and took them out again , twisted a rope round the cart , and all the trees , lifted the whole affair on his back , and set off home , leading the horses behind him by the rein .
When he reached the gate , he found the whole row of carts standing there , unable to get any further for the stone which lay in the gap .
` What ! '
said Hans , ` can twelve men not move that stone ? '
With that he lifted it and threw it out of hte way , and went on with his burden on his back , and the horses behind him , and arrived at the farm long before any of the others .
The squire was walking about there , looking and looking , for he was very curious to know what had happened .
Finally , he caught sight of Hans coming along in this fashion , and was so frightened that he did not know what to do , but he shut the gate and put on the bar .
When Hans reached the gate of the courtyard , he laid down the trees and hammered at it , but no one came to open it .
He then took the trees and tossed them over the barn into the yard , and the cart after them , so that every wheel flew off in a different direction .
When the squire saw this , he thought to himself , ` The horses will come the same way if I do n't open the door , ' so he did this .
` Good day , master , ' said Hans , and put the horses into the stable , and went into the kitchen , to get something to eat .
At length the other men came home with their loads .
When they came in , Hans said to them , ` Do you remember the bargain we made last night ?
Which of you is it that 's going to be hanged ? '
` Oh , ' said they , ` that was only a joke ; it did n't mean anything . '
` Oh well , it does n't matter , ` said Hans , and there was no more about it .
The squire , however , and his wife and the steward , had much to say to each other about the terrible man they had got , and all were agreed that they must get rid of him in some way or other .
The steward said that he would manage this all right .
Next morning they were to clean the well , and they would use of that opportunity .
They would get him down into the well , and then have a big mill-stone ready to throw down on top of him -- that would settle him .
After that they could just fill in the well , and then escape being at any expense for his funeral .
Both the squire and his wife thought this a splendid idea , and went about rejoicing at the thought that now they would get rid of Hans .
But Hans was hard to kill , as we shall see .
He slept long next morning , as he always did , and finally , as he would not waken by himself , the squire had to go and call him .
` Get up , Hans , you are sleeping too long , ' he cried .
Hans woke up and rubbed his eyes .
` That 's so , ' said he , ' I shall rise and have my breakfast . '
He got up then and dressed himself , while the breakfast stood waiting for him .
When he had finished the whole of this , he asked what he was to do that day .
He was told to help the other men to clean out the well .
That was all right , and he went out and found the other men waiting for him .
To these he said that they could choose whichever task they liked -- either to go down into the well and fill the buckets while he pulled them up , or pull them up , and he alone would go down to the bottom of the well .
They answered that they would rather stay above-ground , as there would be no room for so many of them down in the well .
Hans therefore went down alone , and began to clean out the well , but the men had arranged how they were to act , and immediately each of them seized a stone from a heap of huge blocks , and threw them down above him , thinking to kill him with these .
Hans , however , gave no more heed to this than to shout up to them , to keep the hens away from the well , for they were scraping gravel down on the top of him .
They then saw that they could not kill him with little stones , but they had still the big one left .
The whole twelve of them set to work with poles and rollers and rolled the big mill-stone to the brink of the well .
It was with the greatest difficulty that they got it thrown down there , and now they had no doubt that he had got all that he wanted .
But the stone happened to fall so luckily that his head went right through the hole in the middle of the mill-stone , so that it sat round his neck like a priest 's collar .
At this , Hans would stay down no longer .
He came out of the well , with the mill-stone round his neck , ad went straight to the squire and complained that the other men were trying to make a fool of him .
He would not be their priest , he said ; he had too little learning for that .
Saying this , he bent down his head and shook the stone off , so that it crushed one of the squire 's big toes .
The squire went limping in to his wife , and the steward was sent for .
He was told that he must devise some plan for getting rid of this terrible person .
The scheme he had devised before had been of no use , and now good counsel was scarce .
` Oh , no ' said the steward , ` there are good enough ways yet .
The squire can send him this evening to fish in Devilmoss Lake : he will never escape alive from there , for no one can go there by night for Old Eric . '
That was a grand idea , both the squire and his wife thought , and so he limped out again to Hans , and said that he would punish his men for having tried to make a fool of him .
Meanwhile , Hans could do a little job where he would be free from these rascals .
He should go out on the lake and fish there that night , and would then be free from all work on the following day .
` All right , ' said Hans ; ' I am well content with that , but I must have something with me to eat -- a baking of bread , a cask of butter , a barrel of ale , and a keg of brandy .
I ca n't do with less than that . '
The squire said that he could easily get all that , so Hans got all of these tied up together , hung them over his shoulder on his good staff , and tramped away to Devilmoss Lake .
There he got into the boat , rowed out upon the lake , and got everything ready to fish .
As he now lay out there in the middle of the lake , and it was pretty late in the evening , he thought he would have something to eat first , before starting to work .
Just as he was at his busiest with this , Old Eric rose out of the lake , caught him by the cuff of the neck , whipped him out of the boat , and dragged him down to the bottom .
It was a lucky thing that Hans had his walking-stick with him that day , and had just time to catch hold of it when he felt Old Eric 's claws in his neck , so when they got down to the bottom he said , ` Stop now , just wait a little ; here is solid ground . '
With that he caught Old Eric by the back of the neck with one hand , and hammered away on his back with the staff , till he beat him out as flat as a pancake .
Old Eric then began to lament and howl , begging him just to let him go , and he would never come back to the lake again .
` No , my good fellow , ' said Hans , ` you wo n't get off until you promise to bring all the fish in the lake up to the squire 's courtyard , before to-morrow morning . '
Old Eric eagerly promised this , if Hans would only let him go ; so Hans rowed ashore , ate up the rest of his provisions , and went home to bed .
Next morning , when the squire rose and opened his front door , the fish came tumbling into the porch , and the whole yard was crammed full of them .
He ran in again to his wife , for he could never devise anything himself , and said to her , ` What shall we do with him now ?
Old Eric has n't taken him .
I am certain that all the fish are out of the lake , for the yard is just filled with them . '
` Yes , that 's a bad business , ' said she ; ` you must see if you ca n't get him sent to Purgatory , to demand tribute . '
The squire therefore made his way to the men 's quarters , to speak to Hans , and it took him all his time to push his way along the walls , under the eaves , on account of the fish that filled the yard .
He thanked Hans for having fished so well , and said that now he had an errand for him , which he could only give to a trusty servant , and that was to journey to Purgatory , and demand three years tribute , which , he said , was owing to him from that quarter .
` Willingly , ' said Hans ; ` but what road do I go , to get there ? '
The squire stood , and did not know what to say , and had first to go in to his wife to ask her .
` Oh , what a fool you are ! '
said she , ` ca n't you direct him straight forward , south through the wood ?
Whether he gets there or not , we shall be quit of him . '
Out goes the squire again to Hans .
` The way lies straight forward , south through the wood , ' said he .
Hans then must have his provisions for the journey ; two bakings of bread , two casks of butter , two barrels of ale , and two kegs of brandy .
He tied all these up together , and got them on his shoulder hanging on his good walking-stick , and off he tramped southward .
After he had got through the wood , there was more than one road , and he was in doubt which of them was the right one , so he sat down and opened up his bundle of provisions .
He found he had left his knife at home , but by good chance , there was a plough lying close at hand , so he took the coulter of this to cut the bread with .
As he sat there and took his bite , a man came riding past him .
` Where are you from ? '
said Hans .
` From Purgatory , ' said the man .
` Then stop and wait a little , ' said Hans ; but the man was in a hurry , and would not stop , so Hans ran after him and caught the horse by the tail .
This brought it down on its hind legs , and the man went flying over its head into a ditch .
` Just wait a little , ' said Hans ; ' I am going the same way . '
He got his provisions tied up again , and laid them on the horse 's back ; then he took hold of the reins and said to the man , ` We two can go along together on foot . '
As they went on their way Hans told the stranger both about the errand he had on hand and the fun he had had with Old Eric .
The other said but little but he was well acquainted with the way , and it was no long time before they arrived at the gate .
There both horse and rider disappeared , and Hans was left alone outside .
` They will come and let me in presently , ' he thought to himself ; but no one came .
He hammered at the gate ; still no one appeared .
Then he got tired of waiting , and smashed at the gate with his staff until he knocked it in pieces and got inside .
A whole troop of little demons came down upon him and asked what he wanted .
His master 's compliments , said Hans , and he wanted three years ' tribute .
At this they howled at him , and were about to lay hold of him and drag him off ; but when they had got some raps from his walking-stick they let go again , howled still louder than before , and ran in to Old Eric , who was still in bed , after his adventure in the lake .
They told him that a messenger had come from the squire at Devilmoss to demand three years ' tribute .
He had knocked the gate to pieces and bruised their arms and legs with his iron staff .
` Give him three years ' !
give him ten ! '
shouted Old Eric , ` only do n't let him come near me . '
So all the little demons came dragging so much silver and gold that it was something awful .
Hans filled his bundle with gold and silver coins , put it on his neck , and tramped back to his master , who was scared beyond all measure at seeing him again .
But Hans was also tired of service now .
Of all the gold and silver he brought with him he let the squire keep one half , and he was glad enough , both for the money and at getting rid of Hans .
The other half he took home to his father the smith in Furreby .
To him also he said , ` Farewell ; ' he was now tired of living on shore among mortal men , and preferred to go home again to his mother .
Since that time no one has ever seen Hans , the Mermaid 's son .
Peter Bull From the Danish .
There once lived in Denmark a peasant and his wife who owned a very good farm , but had no children .
They often lamented to each other that they had no one of their own to inherit all the wealth that they possessed .
They continued to prosper , and became rich people , but there was no heir to it all .
One year it happened that they owned a pretty little bull-calf , which they called Peter .
It was the prettiest little creature they had ever seen -- so beautiful and so wise that it understood everything that was said to it , and so gentle and so full of play that both the man and his wife came to be as fond of it as if it had been their own child .
One day the man said to his wife , ' I wonder , now , whether our parish clerk could teach Peter to talk ; in that case we could not do better than adopt him as our son , and let him inherit all that we possess . '
` Well , I do n't know , ' said his wife , ` our clerk is tremendously learned , and knows much more than his Paternoster , and I could almost believe that he might be able to teach Peter to talk , for Peter has a wonderfully good head too .
You might at least ask him about it . '
Off went the man to the clerk , and asked him whether he thought he could teach a bull-calf that they had to speak , for they wished so much to have it as their heir .
The clerk was no fool ; he looked round about to see that no one could overhear them , and said , ` Oh , yes , I can easily do that , but you must not speak to anyone about it .
It must be done in all secrecy , and the priest must not know of it , otherwise I shall get into trouble , as it is forbidden .
It will also cost you something , as some very expensive books are required . '
That did not matter at all , the man said ; they would not care so very much what it cost .
The clerk could have a hundred dollars to begin with to buy the books .
He also promised to tell no one about it , and to bring the calf round in the evening .
He gave the clerk the hundred dollars on the spot , and in the evening took the calf round to him , and the clerk promised to do his best with it .
In a week 's time he came back to the clerk to hear about the calf and see how it was thriving .
The clerk , however , said that he could not get a sight of it , for then Peter would long after him and forget all that he had already learned .
He was getting on well with his learning , but another hundred dollars were needed , as they must have more books .
The peasant had the money with him , so he gave it to the clerk , and went home again with high hopes .
In another week the man came again to learn what progress Peter had made now .
` He is getting on very well , ' said the clerk . '
I suppose he ca n't say anything yet ? '
said the man .
` Oh , yes , ' said the clerk , ` he can say `` Moo '' now . '
` Do you think he will get on with his learning ? '
asked the peasant .
` Oh , yes , ' said the clerk , ` but I shall want another hundred dollars for books .
Peter ca n't learn well out of the ones that he has got . '
` Well , well , ' said the man , ` what must be spent shall be spent . '
So he gave the clerk the third hundred dollars for books , and a cask of good old ale for Peter .
The clerk drank the ale himself , and gave the calf milk , which he thought would be better for it .
Some weeks passed , during which the peasant did not come round to ask after the calf , being frightened lest it should cost him another hundred dollars , for he had begun to squirm a bit at having to part with so much money .
Meanwhile the clerk decided that the calf was as fat as it could be , so he killed it .
After he had got all the beef out of the way he went inside , put on his black clothes , and made his way to the peasant 's house .
As soon as he had said ` Good-day ' he asked , ` Has Peter come home here ? '
` No , indeed , he has n't , ' said the man ; ` surely he has n't run away ? ' '
I hope , ' said the clerk , ` that he would not behave so contemptibly after all the trouble I have had to teach him , and all that I have spent upon him .
I have had to spend at least a hundred dollars of my own money to buy books for him before I got him so far on .
He could say anything he liked now , so he said to-day that he longed to see his parents again .
I was willing to give him that pleasure , but I was afraid that he would n't be able to find the way here by himself , so I made myself ready to go with him .
When we had got outside the house I remembered that I had left my stick inside , and went in again to get it .
When I came out again Peter had gone off on his own account .
I thought he would be here , and if he is n't I do n't know where he is . '
The peasant and his wife began to lament bitterly that Peter had run away in this fashion just when they were to have so much joy of him , and after they had spent so much on his education .
The worst of it was that now they had no heir after all .
The clerk comforted them as best he could ; he also was greatly distressed that Peter should have behaved in such a way just when he should have gained honour from his pupil .
Perhaps he had only gone astray , and he would advertise him at church next Sunday , and find out where anyone had seen him .
Then he bade them ` Good-bye , ' and went home nad dined on a good fat veal roast .
Now it so happened that the clerk took in a newspaper , and one day he chanced to read in its columns of a new merchant who had settled in a town at some distance , and whose name was ` Peter Bull . '
He put the newspaper in his pocket , and went round to the sorrowing couple who had lost their heir .
He read the paragraph to them , and added , ' I wonder , now , whether that could be your bull-calf Peter ? '
` Yes , of course it is , ' said the man ; ` who else would it be ? '
His wife then spoke up and said , ` You must set out , good man , and see about him , for it is him , I am perfectly certain .
Take a good sum of money with you , too ; for who knows but what he may want some cash now that he has turned a merchant ! '
Next day the man got a bag of money on his back and a sandwich in his pocket , and his pipe in his mouth , and set out for the town where the new merchant lived .
It was no short way , and he travelled for many days before he finally arrived there .
He reached it one morning , just at daybreak , found out the right place , and asked if the merchant was at home .
Yes , he was , said the people , but he was not up yet .
` That does n't matter , ' said the peasant , ` for I am his father .
Just show me up to his bedroom . '
He was shown up to the room , and as soon as he entered it , ad caught sight of the merchant , he recognised him at once .
He had the same broad forehead , the same thick neck , and same red hair , but in other respects he was now like a human being .
The peasant rushed straight up to him and took a firm hold of him . '
O Peter , ' said he , ` what a sorrow you have caused us , both myself and your mother , by running off like this just as we had got you well educated !
Get up , now , so that I can see you properly , and have a talk with you . '
The merchant thought that it was a lunatic who had made his way in to him , and thought it best to take things quietly .
` All right , ' said he , ' I shall do so at once . '
He got out of bed and made haste to dress himself .
` Ay , ' said the peasant , ` now I can see how clever our clerk is .
He has done well by you , for now you look just like a human being .
If one did n't know it , one would never think that it was you we got from the red cow ; will you come home with me now ? '
` No , ' said the merchant , ' I ca n't find time just now .
I have a big business to look after . '
` You could have the farm at once , you know , ' said the peasant , ` and we old people would retire .
But if you would rather stay in business , of course you may do so .
Are you in want of anything ? '
` Oh , yes , ' said the merchant ; ' I want nothing so much as money .
A merchant has always a use for that . ' '
I can well believe that , ' said the peasant , ` for you had nothing at all to start with .
I have brought some with me for that very end . '
With that he emptied his bag of money out upon the table , so that it was all covered with bright dollars .
When the merchant saw what kind of man he had before him he began to speak him fair , and invited him to stay with him for some days , so that they might have some more talk together .
` Very well , ' said the peasant , ` but you must call me `` Father . '' ' '
I have neither father nor mother alive , ' said Peter Bull . '
I know that , ' said the man ; ` your real father was sold at Hamburg last Michaelmas , and your real mother died while calving in spring ; but my wife and I have adopted you as our own , and you are our only heir , so you must call me `` Father . '' '
Peter Bull was quite willing to do so , and it was settled that he should keep the money , while the peasant made his will and left to him all that he had , before he went home to his wife , and told her the whole story .
She was delighted to hear that it was true enough about Peter Bull -- that he was no other than their own bull-calf .
` You must go at once and tell the clerk , ' said she , ` and pay him the hundred dollars of his own money that he spent upon our son .
He has earned them well , and more besides , for all the joy he has given us in having such a son and heir . '
The man agreed with this , and thanked the clerk for all he had done , and gave him two hundred dollars .
Then he sold the farm , and removed with his wife to the town where their dear son and heir was living .
To him they gave all their wealth , and lived with him till their dying day .
The Bird ` Grip ' Translated from the Swedish .
It happened once that a king , who had a great kingdom and three sons , became blind , and no human skill or art could restore to him his sight .
At last there came to the palace an old woman , who told him that in the whole world there was only one thing that could give him back his sight , and that was to get the bird Grip ; his song would open the King 's eyes .
When the king 's eldest son heard this he offered to bring the bird Grip , which was kept in a cage by a king in another country , and carefully guarded as his greatest treasure .
The blind king was greatly rejoiced at his son 's resolve , fitted him out in the best way he could , and let him go .
When the prince had ridden some distance he came to an inn , in which there were many guests , all of whom were merry , and drank and sang and played at dice .
This joyous life pleased the prince so well that he stayed in the inn , took part in the playing and drinking , and forgot both his blind father and the bird Grip .
Meanwhile the king waited with both hope and anxiety for his son 's return , but as time went on and nothing was heard of him , the second prince asked leave to go in search of his brother , as well as to bring the bird Grip .
The king granted his request , and fitted him out in the finest fashion .
But when the prince came to the inn and found his brother among his merry companions , he also remained there and forgot both the bird Grip and his blind father .
When the king noticed that neither of his sons returned , although a long time had passed since the second one set out , he was greatly distressed , for not only had he lost all hope of getting back his sight , but he had also lost his two eldest sons .
The youngest now came to him , and offered to go in search of his brothers and to bring the bird Grip ; he was quite certain that he would succeed in this .
The king was unwilling to risk his third son on such an errand , but he begged so long that his father had at last to consent .
This prince also was fitted out in the finest manner , like his brothers , and so rode away .
He also turned into the same inn as his brothers , and when these saw him they assailed him with many entreaties to remain with them and share their merry life .
But he answered that now , when he had found them , his next task was to get the bird Grip , for which his blind father was longing , and so he had not a single hour to spare with them in the inn .
He then said farewell to his brothers , and rode on to find another inn in which to pass the night .
When he had ridden a long way , and it began to grow dark , he came to a house which lay deep in the forest .
Here he was received in a very friendly manner by the host , who put his horse into the stable , and led the prince himself into the guest-chamber , where he ordered a maid-servant to lay the cloth and set down the supper .
It was now dark , and while the girl was laying the cloth and setting down the dishes , and the prince had begun to appease his hunger , he heard the most piteous shrieks and cries from the next room .
He sprang up from the table and asked the girl what those cries were , and whether he had fallen into a den of robbers .
The girl answered that these shrieks were heard every night , but it was no living being who uttered them ; it was a dead man , who life the host had taken because he could not pay for the meals he had had in the inn .
The host further refused to bury the dead man , as he had left nothing to pay the expenses of the funeral , and every night he went and scourged the dead body of his victim .
When she had said this she lifted the cover off one of the dishes , and the prince saw that there lay on it a knife and an axe .
He understood then that the host meant to ask him by this what kind of death he preferred to die , unless he was willing to ransom his life with his money .
He then summoned the host , gave him a large sum for his own life , and paid the dead man 's debt as well , besides paying him for burying the body , which the murderer now promised to attend to .
The prince , however , felt that his life was not safe in this murderer 's den , and asked the maid to help him to escape that night .
She replied that the attempt to do so might cost her her own life , as the key of the stable in which the prince 's horse stood lay under the host 's pillow ; but , as she herself was a prisoner there , she would help him to escape if he would take her along with him .
He promised to do so , and they succeeded in getting away from the inn , and rode on until they came to another far away from it , where the prince got a good place for the girl before proceeding on his journey .
As he now rode all alone through a forest there met him a fox , who greeted him in a friendly fashion , and asked him where he was going , and on what errand he was bent .
The prince answered that his errand was too important to be confided to everyone that he met .
` You are right in that , ' said the fox , ` for it relates to the bird Grip , which you want to take and bring home to your blind father ; I could help you in this , but in that case you must follow my counsel . '
The prince thought that this was a good offer , especially as the fox was ready to go with him and show him the way to the castle , where the bird Grip sat in his cage , and so he promised to obey the fox 's instructions .
When they had traversed the forest together they saw the castle at some distance .
Then the fox gave the prince three grains of gold , one of which he was to throw into the guard-room , another into the room where the bird Grip sat , and the third into its cage .
He could then take the bird , but he must beware of stroking it ; otherwise it would go ill with him .
The prince took the grains of gold , and promised to follow the fox 's directions faithfully .
When he came to the guard-room of the castle he threw one of the grains in there , and the guards at once fell asleep .
The same thing happened with those who kept watch in the room beside the bird Grip , and when he threw the third grain into its cage the bird also fell asleep .
When the prince got the beautiful bird into his hand he could not resist the temptation to stroke it , whereupon it awoke and began to scream .
At this the whole castle woke up , and the prince was taken prisoner .
As he now sat in his prison , and bitterly lamented that his own disobedience had brought himself into trouble , and deprived his father of the chance of recovering his sight , the fox suddenly stood in front of him .
The prince was very pleased to see it again , and received with great meekness all its reproaches , as well as promised to be more obedient in the future , if the fox would only help him out of his fix .
The fox said that he had come to assist him , but he could do no more than advise the prince , when he was brought up for trial , to answer ` yes ' to all the judge 's questions , and everything would go well .
The prince faithfully followed his instructions , so that when the judge asked him whether he had meant to steal the bird Grip he said ` Yes , ' and when the judge asked him if he was a master-thief he again answered ` Yes . '
When the king heard that he admitted being a master-thief , he said that he would forgive him the attempt to steal the bird if he would go to the next kingdom and carry off the world 's most beautiful princess , and bring her to him .
To this also the prince said ` Yes . '
When he left the castle he met the fox , who went along with him to the next kingdom , and when they came near the castle there , gave him three grains of gold -- one to throw into the guard-room , another into the princess 's chamber , and the third into her bed .
At the same time he strictly warned him not to kiss the princess .
The prince went into the castle , and did with the grains of gold as the fox had told him , so that sleep fell upon everyone there ; but when he had taken the princess into his arms he forgot the fox 's warning , at the sight of her beauty , and kissed her .
Then both she and all the others in the castle woke ; the prince was taken prisoner , and put into a strong dungeon .
Here the fox again came to him and reproached him with his disobedience , but promised to help him out of this trouble also if he would answer ` yes ' to everything they asked him at his trial .
The prince willingly agreed to this , and admitted to the judge that he had meant to steal the princess , and that he was a master-thief .
When the king learned this he said he would forgive his offence if he would go to the next kingdom and steal the horse with the four golden shoes .
To this also the prince said ` Yes . '
When he had gone a little way from the castle he met the fox , and they continued on their journey together .
When they reached the end of it the prince for the third time received three grains of gold from the fox , with directions to throw one into the guard-chamber , another into the stable , and the third into the horse 's stall .
But the fox told him that above the horse 's stall hung a beautiful golden saddle , which he must not touch , if he did not want to bring himself into new troubles worse than those he had escaped from , for then the fox could help him no longer .
The prince promised to be firm this time .
He threw the grains of gold in the proper places , and untied the horse , but with that he caught sight of the golden saddle , and thought that none but it could suit so beautiful a horse , especially as it had golden shoes .
But just as he stretched out his hand to take it he received from some invisible being so hard a blow on the arm that it was made quite numb .
This recalled to him his promise and his danger , so he led out the horse without looking at the golden saddle again .
The fox was waiting for him outside the castle , and the prince confessed to him that he had very nearly given way to temptation this time as well . '
I know that , ' said the fox , ` for it was I who struck you over the arm . '
As they now went on together the prince said that he could not forget the beautiful princess , and asked the fox whether he did not think that she ought to ride home to his father 's palace on this horse with the golden shoes .
The fox agreed that this would be excellent ; if the prince would now go and carry her off he would give him three grains of gold for that purpose .
The prince was quite ready , and promised to keep better command of himself this time , and not kiss her .
He got the grains of gold and entered the castle , where he carried off the princess , set her on the beautiful horse , and held on his way .
When they came near to the castle where the bird Grip sat in his cage he again asked the fox for three grains of gold .
These he got , and with them he was successful in carrying off the bird .
He was now full of joy , for his blind father would now recover his sight , while he himself owned the world 's most beautiful princess and the horse with the golden shoes .
The prince and princess travelled on together with mirth and happiness , and the fox followed them until they came to the forest where the prince first met with him .
` Here our ways part , ' said the fox .
` You have now got all that your heart desired , and you will have a prosperous journey to your father 's palace if only you do not ransom anyone 's life with money . '
The prince thanked the fox for all his help , promised to give heed to his warning , said farewell to him , and rode on , with the princess by his side and the bird Grip on his wrist .
They soon arrived at the inn where the two eldest brothers had stayed , forgetting their errand .
But now no merry song or noise of mirth was heard from it .
When the prince came nearer he saw two gallows erected , and when he entered the inn along with the princess he saw that all the rooms were hung with black , and that everything inside foreboded sorrow and death .
He asked the reason of this , and was told that two princes were to be hanged that day for debt ; they had spent all their money in feasting and playing , and were now deeply in debt to the host , and as no one could be found to ransom their lives they were about to be hanged according to the law .
The prince knew that it was his two brothers who had thus forfeited their lives and it cut him to the heart to think that two princes should suffer such a shameful death ; and , as he had sufficient money with him , he paid their debts , and so ransomed their lives .
At first the brothers were grateful for their liberty , but when they saw the youngest brother 's treasures they became jealous of his good fortune , and planned how to bring him to destruction , and then take the bird Grip , the princess , and the horse with the golden shoes , and convey them to their blind father .
After they had agreed on how to carry out their treachery they enticed the prince to a den of lions and threw him down among them .
Then they set the princess on horseback , took the bird Grip , and rode homeward .
The princess wept bitterly , but they told her that it would cost her her life if she did not say that the two brothers had won all the treasures .
When they arrived at their father 's palace there was great rejoicing , and everyone praised the two princes for their courage and bravery .
When the king inquired after the youngest brother they answered that he had led such a life in the inn that he had been hanged for debt .
The king sorrowed bitterly over this , because the youngest prince was his dearest son , and the joy over the treasures soon died away , for the bird Grip would not sing so that the king might recover his sight , the princess wept night and day , and no one dared to venture so close to the horse as to have a look at his golden shoes .
Now when the youngest prince was thrown down into the lions ' den he found the fox sitting there , and the lions , instead of tearing him to pieces , showed him the greatest friendliness .
Nor was the fox angry with him for having forgot his last warning .
He only said that sons who could so forget their old father and disgrace their royal birth as those had done would not hesitate to betray their brother either .
Then he took the prince up out of the lion 's den and gave him directions what to do now so as to come by his rights again .
The prince thanked the fox with all his heart for his true friendship , but the fox answered that if he had been of any use to him he would now for his own part ask a service of him .
The prince replied that he would do him any service that was in his power . '
I have only one thing to ask of you , ' said the fox , ` and that is , that you should cut off my head with your sword . '
The prince was astonished , and said that he could not bring himself to cut the had off his truest friend , and to this he stuck in spite of all the fox 's declarations that it was the greatest service he could do him .
At this the fox became very sorrowful , and declared that the prince 's refusal to grant his request now compelled him to do a deed which he was very unwilling to do -- if the prince would not cut off his head , then he must kill the prince himself .
Then at last the prince drew his good sword and cut off the fox 's head , and the next moment a youth stood before him .
` Thanks , ' said he , ` for this service , which has freed me from a spell that not even death itself could loosen .
I am the dead man who lay unburied in the robber 's inn , where you ransomed me and gave me honourable burial , and therefore I have helped you in your journey . '
With this they parted and the prince , disguising himself as a horse-shoer , went up to his father 's palace and offered his services there .
The king 's men told him that a horse-shoer was indeed wanted at the palace , but he must be one who could lift up the feet of the horse with the golden shoes , and such a one they had not yet been able to find .
The prince asked to see the horse , and as soon as he entered the stable the steed began to neigh in a friendly fashion , and stood as quiet and still as a lamb while the prince lifted up his hoofs , one after the other , and showed the king 's men the famous golden shoes .
After this the king 's men began to talk about the bird Grip , and how strange it was that he would not sing , however well he was attended to .
The horse-shoer then said that he knew the bird very well ; he had seen it when it sat in its cage in another king 's palace , and if it did not sing now it must be because it did not have all that it wanted .
He himself knew so much about the bird 's ways that if he only got to see it he could tell at once what it lacked .
The king 's men now took counsel whether they ought to take the stranger in before the king , for in his chamber sat the bird Grip along with the weeping princess .
It was decided to risk doing so , and the horse-shoer was led into the king 's chamber , where he had no sooner called the bird by its name than it began to sing and the princess to smile .
Then the darkness cleared away from the king 's eyes , and the more the bird sang the more clearly did he see , till at last in the strange horse-shoer he recognised his youngest son .
Then the princess told the king how treacherously his eldest sons had acted , and he had them banished from his kingdom ; but the youngest prince married the princess , and got the horse with the golden shoes and half the kingdom from his father , who kept for himself so long as he lived the bird Grip , which now sang with all its heart to the king and all his court .
Snowflake Slavonic story .
Contes Populaires Slaves , traduits par Louis Leger .
Paris : Leroux , Editeur .
Once upon a time there lived a peasant called Ivan , and he had a wife whose name was Marie .
They would have been quite happy except for one thing : they had no children to play with , and as they were now old people they did not find that watching the children of their neighbours at all made up to them for having one of their own .
One winter , which nobody living will ever forget , the snow lay so deep that it came up to the knees of even the tallest man .
When it had all fallen , and the sun was shining again , the children ran out into the street to play , and the old man and his wife sat at their window and gazed at them .
The children first made a sort of little terrace , and stamped it hard and firm , and then they began to make a snow woman .
Ivan and Marie watched them , the while thinking about many things .
Suddenly Ivan 's face brightened , and , looking at his wife , he said , ` Wife , why should n't we make a snow woman too ? '
` Why not ? '
replied Marie , who happened to be in a very good temper ; ` it might amuse us a little .
But there is no use making a woman .
Let us make a little snow child , and pretend it is a living one . '
` Yes , let us do that , ' said Ivan , and he took down his cap and went into the garden with his old wife .
Then the two set to work with all their might to make a doll out of the snow .
They shaped a little body and two little hands and two little feet .
On top of all they placed a ball of snow , out of which the head was to be .
` What in the world are you doing ? '
asked a passer-by .
` Ca n't you guess ? '
returned Ivan .
` Making a snow-child , ' replied Marie .
They had finished the nose and the chin .
Two holes were left for the eyes , and Ivan carefully shaped out the mouth .
No sooner had he done so than he felt a warm breath upon his cheek .
He started back in surprise and looked -- and behold !
the eyes of the child met his , and its lips , which were as red as raspberries , smiled at him !
` What is it ? '
cried Ivan , crossing himself .
` Am I mad , or is the thing bewitched ? '
The snow-child bent its head as if it had been really alive .
It moved its little arms and its little legs in the snow that lay about it just as the living children did theirs .
` Ah !
Ivan , Ivan , ' exclaimed Marie , trembling with joy , ` heaven has sent us a child at last ! '
And she threw herself upon Snowflake -LRB- for that was the snow-child 's name -RRB- and covered her with kisses .
And the loose snow fell away from Snowflake as an egg shell does from an egg , and it was a little girl whom Marie held in her arms .
` Oh !
my darling Snowflake ! '
cried the old woman , and led her into the cottage .
And Snowflake grew fast ; each hour as well as each day made a difference , and every day she became more and more beautiful .
The old couple hardly knew how to contain themselves for joy , and thought of nothing else .
The cottage was always full of village children , for they amused Snowflake , and there was nothing in the world they would not have done to amuse her .
She was their doll , and they were continually inventing new dresses for her , and teaching her songs or playing with her .
Nobody knew how clever she was !
She noticed everything , and could learn a lesson in a moment .
Anyone would have taken her for thirteen at least !
And , besides all that , she was so good and obedient ; and so pretty , too !
Her skin was as white as snow , her eyes as blue as forget-me-nots , and her hair was long and golden .
Only her cheeks had no colour in them , but were as fair as her forehead .
So the winter went on , till at last the spring sun mounted higher in the heavens and began to warm the earth .
The grass grew green in the fields , and high in the air the larks were heard singing .
The village girls met and danced in a ring , singing , ` Beautiful spring , how came you here ?
How came you here ?
Did you come on a plough , or was it a harrow ? '
Only Snowflake sat quite still by the window of the cottage .
` What is the matter , dear child ? '
asked Marie .
` Why are you so sad ?
Are you ill ?
or have they treated you unkindly ? '
` No , ' replied Snowflake , ` it is nothing , mother ; no one has hurt me ; I am well . '
The spring sun had chased away the last snow from its hiding place under the hedges ; the fields were full of flowers ; nightingales sang in the trees , and all the world was gay .
But the gayer grew the birds and the flowers the sadder became Snowflake .
She hid herself from her playmates , and curled herself up where the shadows were deepest , like a lily amongst its leaves .
Her only pleasure was to lie amid the green willows near some sparkling stream .
At the dawn and at twilight only she seemed happy .
When a great storm broke , and the earth was white with hail , she became bright and joyous as the Snowflake of old ; but when the clouds passed , and the hail melted beneath the sun , Snowflake would burst into tears and weep as a sister would weep over her brother .
The spring passed , and it was the eve of St. John , or Midsummer Day .
This was the greatest holiday of the year , when the young girls met in the woods to dance and play .
They went to fetch Snowflake , and said to Marie : ` Let her come and dance with us . '
But Marie was afraid ; she could not tell why , only she could not bear the child to go .
Snowflake did not wish to go either , but they had no excuse ready .
So Marie kissed the girl and said : ` Go , my Snowflake , and be happy with your friends , and you , dear children , be careful of her .
You know she is the light of my eyes to me . '
` Oh , we will take care of her , ' cried the girls gaily , and they ran off to the woods .
There they wore wreaths , gathered nosegays , and sang songs some sad , some merry .
And whatever they did Snowflake did too .
When the sun set they lit a fire of dry grass , and placed themselves in a row , Snowflake being the last of all .
` Now , watch us , ' they said , ` and run just as we do . '
And they all began to sing and to jump one after another across the fire .
Suddenly , close behind them , they heard a sigh , then a groan .
` Ah ! '
They turned hastily and looked at each other .
There was nothing .
They looked again .
Where was Snowflake ?
She has hidden herself for fun , they thought , and searched for her everywhere .
` Snowflake !
Snowflake ! '
But there was no answer .
` Where can she be ?
Oh , she must have gone home . '
They returned to the village , but there was no Snowflake .
For days after that they sought her high and low .
They examined every bush and every hedge , but there was no Snowflake .
And long after everyone else had given up hope Ivan and Marie would wander through the woods crying ` Snowflake , my dove , come back , come back ! '
And sometimes they thought they heard a call , but it was never the voice of Snowflake .
And what had become of her ?
Had a fierce wild beast seized her and dragged her into his lair in the forest ?
Had some bird carried her off across the wide blue sea ?
No , no beast had touched her , no bird had borne her away .
With the first breath of flame that swept over her when she ran with her friends Snowflake had melted away , and a little soft haze floating upwards was all that remained of her .
I Know What I Have Learned From the Danish .
There was once a man who had three daughters , and they were all married to trolls , who lived underground .
One day the man thought that he would pay them a visit , and his wife gave him some dry bread to eat by the way .
After he had walked some distance he grew both tired and hungry , so he sat down on the east side of a mound and began to eat his dry bread .
The mound then opened , and his youngest daughter came out of it , and said , ` Why , father !
why are you not coming in to see me ? '
` Oh , ' said he , ` if I had known that you lived here , and had seen any entrance , I would have come in . '
Then he entered the mound along with her .
The troll came home soon after this , and his wife told him that her father was come , and asked him to go and buy some beef to make broth with .
` We can get it easier than that ! '
said the troll .
He fixed an iron spike into one of the beams of the roof , and ran his head against this till he had knocked several large pieces off his head .
He was just as well as ever after doing this , and they got their broth without further trouble .
The troll then gave the old man a sackful of money , and laden with this he betook himself homewards .
When he came near his home he remembered that he had a cow about to calve , so he laid down the money on the ground , ran home as fast as he could , and asked his wife whether the cow had calved yet .
` What kind of a hurry is this to come home in ? '
said she .
` No , the cow has not calved yet . '
` Then you must come out and help me in with a sackful of money , ' said the man . '
A sackful of money ? '
cried his wife .
` Yes , a sackful of money , ' said he .
` Is that so very wonderful ? '
His wife did not believe very much what he told her , but she humoured him , and went out with him .
When they came to the spot where he had left it there was no money there ; a thief had come along and stolen it .
His wife then grew angry and scolded him heartily .
` Well , well ! '
said he , ` hang the money !
I know what I have learned . '
` What have you learned ? '
said she .
` Ah !
I know that , ' said the man .
After some time had passed the man had a mind to visit his second eldest daughter .
His wife again gave him some dry bread to eat , and when he grew tired and hungry he sat down on the east side of a mound and began to eat it .
As he sat there his daughter came up out of the mound , and invited him to come inside , which he did very willingly .
Soon after this the troll came home .
It was dark by that time , and his wife bade him go and buy some candles .
` Oh , we shall soon get a light , ' said the troll .
With that he dipped his fingers into the fire , and they then gave light without being burned in the least .
The old man got two sacks of money here , and plodded away homewards with these .
When he was very nearly home he again thought of the cow that was with calf , so he laid down the money , ran home , and asked his wife whether the cow had calved yet .
` Whatever is the matter with you ? '
said she .
` You come hurrying as if the whole house was about to fall .
You may set your mind at rest : the cow has not calved yet . '
The man now asked her to come and help him home with the two sacks of money .
She did not believe him very much , but he continued to assure her that it was quite true , till at last she gave in and went with him .
When they came to the spot there had again been a thief there and taken the money .
It was no wonder that the woman was angry about this , but the man only said , ` Ah , if you only knew what I have learned . '
A third time the man set out -- to visit his eldest daughter .
When he came to a mound he sat down on the east side of it and ate the dry bread which his wife had given him to take with him .
The daughter then came out of the mound and invited her father to come inside .
In a little the troll came home , and his wife asked him to go and buy some fish .
` We can get them much more easily than that , ' said the troll .
` Give me your dough trough and your ladle . '
They seated themselves in the trough , and rowed out on the lake which was beside the mound .
When they had got out a little way the troll said to his wife , ` Are my eyes green ? '
` No , not yet , ' said she .
He rowed on a little further and asked again , ` Are my eyes not green yet ? '
` Yes , ' said his wife , ` they are green now . '
Then the troll sprang into the water and ladled up so many fish that in a short time the trough could hold no more .
They then rowed home again , and had a good meal off the fish .
The old man now got three sacks full of money , and set off home with them .
When he was almost home the cow again came into his head , and he laid down the money .
This time , however , he took his wooden shoes and laid them above the money , thinking that no one would take it after that .
Then he ran home and asked his wife whether the cow had calved .
It had not , and she scolded him again for behaving in this way , but in the end he persuaded her to go with him to help him with the three sacks of money .
When they came to the spot they found only the wooden shoes , for a thief had come along in the meantime and taken all the money .
The woman was very angry , and broke out upon her husband ; but he took it all very quietly , and only said , ` Hang the money !
I know what I have learned . '
` What have you learned I should like to know ? '
said his wife .
` You will see that yet , ' said the man .
One day his wife took a fancy for broth , and said to him , ` Oh , go to the village , and buy a piece of beef to make broth . '
` There 's no need of that , ' said he ; ` we can get it an easier way . '
With that he drove a spike into a beam , and ran his head against it , and in consequence had to lie in bed for a long time afterwards .
After he had recovered from this his wife asked him one day to go and buy candles , as they had none .
` No , ' he said , ` there 's no need for that ; ' and he stuck his hand into the fire .
This also made him take to bed for a good while .
When he had got better again his wife one day wanted fish , and asked him to go and buy some .
The man , however , wished again to show what he had learned , so he asked her to come along with him and bring her dough trough and a ladle .
They both seated themselves in this , and rowed upon the lake .
When they had got out a little way the man said , ` Are my eyes green ? '
` No , ' said his wife ; ` why should they be ? '
They rowed a little further out , and he asked again , ` Are my eyes not green yet ? '
` What nonsense is this ? '
said she ; ` why should they be green ? '
` Oh , my dear , ' said he , ` ca n't you just say that they are green ? '
` Very well , ' said she , ` they are green . '
As soon as he heard this he sprang out into the water with the ladle for the fishes , but he just got leave to stay there with them !
The Cunning Shoemaker Sicilianische Mahrchen .
Once upon a time there lived a shoemaker who could get no work to do , and was so poor that he and his wife nearly died of hunger .
At last he said to her , ` It is no use waiting on here -- I can find nothing ; so I shall go down to Mascalucia , and perhaps there I shall be more lucky . '
So down he went to Mascalucia , and walked through the streets crying , ` Who wants some shoes ? '
And very soon a window was pushed up , and a woman 's head was thrust out of it .
` Here are a pair for you to patch , ' she said .
And he sat down on her doorstep and set about patching them .
` How much do I owe you ? '
she asked when they were done . '
A shilling . '
` Here is eighteen pence , and good luck to you . '
And he went his way .
He turned into the next street and set up his cry again , and it was not long before another window was pushed up and another head appeared .
` Here are some shoes for you to patch . '
And the shoemaker sat down on the doorstep and patched them .
` How much do I owe you ? '
asked the woman when the shoes were finished . '
A florin . '
` Here is a crown piece , and good luck to you . '
And she shut the window .
` Well , ' thought the shoemaker , ' I have done finely .
But I will not go back to my wife just yet , as , if I only go on at this rate , I shall soon have enough money to buy a donkey . '
Having made up his mind what was best to do , he stayed in the town a few days longer till he had four gold pieces safe in his purse .
Then he went to the market and for two of them he bought a good strong donkey , and , mounting on its back , he rode home to Catania .
But as he entered a thick wood he saw in the distance a band of robbers who were coming quickly towards him . '
I am lost , ' thought he ; ` they are sure to take from me all the money that I have earned , and I shall be as poor as ever I was .
What can I do ? '
However , being a clever little man and full of spirit , he did not lose heart , but , taking five florins , he fastened them out of sight under the donkey 's thick mane .
Then he rode on .
Directly the robber came up to him they seized him exactly as he had foretold and took away all his money .
` Oh , dear friends ! '
he cried , wringing his hands , ' I am only a poor shoemaker , and have nothing but this donkey left in the world . '
As he spoke the donkey gave himself a shake , and down fell the five florins .
` Where did that come from ? '
asked the robbers .
` Ah , ' replied the shoemaker , ` you have guessed my secret .
The donkey is a golden donkey , and supplies me with all my money . '
` Sell him to us , ' said the robbers .
` We will give you any price you like . '
The shoemaker at first declared that nothing would induce him to sell him , but at last he agreed to hand him over to the robbers for fifty gold pieces .
` But listen to what I tell you , ' said he .
` You must each take it in turn to own him for a night and a day , or else you will all be fighting over the money . '
With these words they parted , the robbers driving the donkey to their cave in the forest and the shoemaker returning home , very pleased with the success of his trick .
He just stopped on the way to pick up a good dinner , and the next day spent most of his gains in buying a small vineyard .
Meanwhile the robbers had arrived at the cave where they lived , and the captain , calling them all round him , announced that it as his right to have the donkey for the first night .
His companions agreed , and then he told his wife to put a mattress in the stable .
She asked if he had gone out of his mind , but he answered crossly , ` What is that to you ?
Do as you are bid , and to-morrow I will bring you some treasures . '
Very early the captain awoke and searched the stable , but could find nothing , and guessed that Master Joseph had been making fun of them .
` Well , ' he said to himself , ` if I have been taken in , the others shall not come off any better . '
So , when one of his men arrived and asked him eagerly how much money he had got , he answered gaily , ` Oh , comrade , if you only knew !
But I shall say nothing about it till everyone has had his turn ! '
One after another they all took the donkey , but no money was forthcoming for anybody .
At length , when all the band had been tricked , they held a council , and resolved to march to the shoemaker 's house and punish him well for his cunning .
Just as before , the shoemaker saw them a long way off , and began to think how he could outwit them again .
When he had hit upon a plan he called his wife , and said to her , ` Take a bladder and fill it with blood , and bind it round your neck .
When the robbers come and demand the money they gave me for the donkey I shall shout to you and tell you to get it quickly .
You must argue with me , and decline to obey me , and then I shall plunge my knife into the bladder , and you must fall to the ground as if you were dead .
There you must lie till I play on my guitar ; then get up and begin to dance . '
The wife made haste to do as she was bid , and there was no time to lose , for the robbers were drawing very near the house .
They entered with a great noise , and overwhelmed the shoemaker with reproaches for having deceived them about the donkey .
` The poor beast must have lost its power owing to the change of masters , ' said he ; ` but we will not quarrel about it .
You shall have back the fifty gold pieces that you gave for him .
` Aite , ' he cried to his wife , ` go quickly to the chest upstairs , and bring down the money for these gentlemen . '
` Wait a little , ' answered she ; ' I must first bake this fish .
It will be spoilt if I leave it now . '
` Go this instant , as you are bid , ' shouted the shoemaker , stamping as if he was in a great passion ; but , as she did not stir , he drew his knife , and stabbed her in the neck .
The blood spurted out freely , and she fell to the ground as if she was dead .
` What have you done ? '
asked the robbers , looking at him in dismay .
` The poor woman was doing nothing . '
` Perhaps I was hasty , but it is easily set right , ' replied the shoemaker , taking down his guitar and beginning to play .
Hardly had he struck the first notes than his wife sat up ; then got on her feet and danced .
The robbers stared with open mouths , and at last they said , ` Master Joseph , you may keep the fifty gold pieces .
But tell us what you will take for your guitar , for you must sell it to us ? '
` Oh , that is impossible ! '
replied the shoemaker , ` for every time I have a quarrel with my wife I just strike her dead , and so give vent to my anger .
This has become such a habit with me that I do n't think I could break myself of it ; and , of course , if I got rid of the guitar I could never bring her back to life again . '
However , the robbers would not listen to him , and at last he consented to take forty gold pieces for the guitar .
Then they all returned to their cave in the forest , delighted with their new purchase , and longing for a chance of trying its powers .
But the captain declared that the first trial belonged to him , and after that the others might have their turn .
That evening he called to his wife and said , ` What have you got for supper ? '
` Macaroni , ' answered she .
` Why have you not boiled a fish ? '
he cried , and stabber in the neck so that she fell dead .
The captain , who was not in the least angry , seized the guitar and began to play ; but , let him play as loud as he would , the dead woman never stirred .
` Oh , lying shoemaker !
Oh , abominable knave !
Twice has he got the better of me .
But I will pay him out ! '
So he raged and swore , but it did him no good .
The fact remained that he had killed his wife and could not bring her back again .
The next morning came one of the robbers to fetch the guitar , and to hear what had happened .
` Well , how have you got on ? '
` Oh , splendidly !
I stabbed my wife , and then began to play , and now she is as well as ever . '
` Did you really ?
Then this evening I will try for myself . '
Of course the same thing happened over again , till all the wives had been killed secretly , and when there were no more left they whispered to each other the dreadful tale , and swore to be avenged on the shoemaker .
The band lost no time in setting out for his house , and , as before , the shoemaker saw them coming from afar .
He called to his wife , who was washing in the kitchen : ` Listen , Aita : when the robbers come and ask for me say I have gone to the vineyard .
Then tell the dog to call me , and chase him from the house . '
When he had given these directions he ran out of the back door and hid behind a barrel .
A few minutes later the robbers arrived , and called loudly for the shoemaker .
` Alas !
good gentlemen , he is up in the vineyard , but I will send the dog after him at once .
Here !
now quickly to the vineyard , and tell your master some gentlemen are here who wish to speak to him .
Go as fast as you can . '
And she opened the door and let the dog out .
` You can really trust the dog to call your husband ? '
asked the robbers .
` Dear me , yes !
He understands everything , and will always carry any message I give him . '
By-and-bye the shoemaker came in and said , ` Good morning , gentlemen ; the dog tells me you wish to speak to me . '
` Yes , we do , ' replied the robber ; ` we have come to speak to you about that guitar .
It is your fault that we have murdered all our wives ; and , though we played as you told us , none of them ever came back to life . '
` You could not have played properly , ' said the shoemaker .
` It was your own fault . '
` Well , we will forget all about it , ' answered the robbers , ` if you will only sell us your dog . '
` Oh , that is impossible !
I should never get on without him . '
But the robbers offered him forty gold pieces , and at last he agreed to let them have the dog .
So they departed , taking the dog with them , and when they got back to their cave the captain declared that it was his right to have the first trial .
He then called his daughter , and said to her , ' I am going to the inn ; if anybody wants me , loose the dog , and send him to call me . '
About an hour after some one arrived on business , and the girl untied the dog and said , ` Go to the inn and call my father ! '
The dog bounded off , but ran straight to the shoemaker .
When the robber got home and found no dog he thought ` He must have gone back to his old master , ' and , though night had already fallen , he went off after him .
` Master Joseph , is the dog here ? '
asked he .
` Ah !
yes , the poor beast is so fond of me !
You must give him time to get accustomed to new ways . '
So the captain brought the dog back , and the following morning handed him over to another of the band , just saying that the animal really could do what the shoemaker had said .
The second robber carefully kept his own counsel , and fetched the dog secretly back from the shoemaker , and so on through the whole band .
At length , when everybody had suffered , they met and told the whole story , and next day they all marched off in fury to the man who had made game of them .
After reproaching him with having deceived them , they tied him up in a sack , and told him they were going to throw him into the sea .
The shoemaker lay quite still , and let them do as they would .
They went on till they came to a church , and the robbers said , ` The sun is hot and the sack is heavy ; let us leave it here and go in and rest . '
So they put the sack down by the roadside , and went into the church .
Now , on a hill near by there was a swineherd looking after a great herd of pigs and whistling merrily .
When Master Joseph heard him he cried out as loud as he could , ' I wo n't ; I wo n't , I say . '
` What wo n't you do ? '
asked the swineherd .
` Oh , ' replied the shoemaker .
` They want me to marry the king 's daughter , and I wo n't do it . '
` How lucky you are ! '
sighed the swineherd .
` Now , if it were only me ! '
` Oh , if that 's all ! '
replied the cunning shoemaker , ` get you into this sack , and let me out . '
Then the swineherd opened the sack and took the place of the shoemaker , who went gaily off , driving the pigs before him .
When the robbers were rested they came out of the church , took up the sack , and carried it to the sea , where they threw it in , and it sank directly .
As they came back they met the shoemaker , and stared at him with open mouths .
` Oh , if you only knew how many pigs live in the sea , ' he cried .
` And the deeper you go the more there are .
I have just brought up these , and mean to return for some more . '
` There are still some left there ? '
` Oh , more than I could count , ' replied the shoemaker . '
I will show you what you must do . '
Then he led the robbers back to the shore .
` Now , ' said he , ` you must each of you tie a stone to your necks , so that you may be sure to go deep enough , for I found the pigs that you saw very deep down indeed . '
Then the robbers all tied stones round their necks , and jumped in , and were drowned , and Master Joseph drove his pigs home , and was a rich man to the end of his days .
The King Who Would Have a Beautiful Wife Sicilianische Mahrchen .
Fifty years ago there lived a king who was very anxious to get married ; but , as he was quite determined that his wife should be as beautiful as the sun , the thing was not so easy as it seemed , for no maiden came up to his standard .
Then he commanded a trusty servant to search through the length and breadth of the land till he found a girl fair enough to be queen , and if he had the good luck to discover one he was to bring her back with him .
The servant set out at once on his journey , and sought high and low-in castles and cottages ; but though pretty maidens were plentiful as blackberries , he felt sure that none of them would please the king .
One day he had wandered far and wide , and was feeling very tired and thirsty .
By the roadside stood a tiny little house , and here he knocked and asked for a cup of water .
Now in this house dwelt two sisters , and one was eighty and the other ninety years old .
They were very poor , and earned their living by spinning .
This had kept their hands very soft and white , like the hands of a girl , and when the water was passed through the lattice , and the servant saw the small , delicate fingers , he said to himself : ' A maiden must indeed be lovely if she has a hand like that . '
And he made haste back , and told the king .
` Go back at once , ' said his majesty , ` and try to get a sight of her . '
The faithful servant departed on his errand without losing any time , and again he knocked at the door of the little house and begged for some water .
As before , the old woman did not open the door , but passed the water through the lattice .
` Do you live here alone ? '
asked the man .
` No , ' replied she , ` my sister lives with me .
We are poor girls , and have to work for our bread . '
` How old are you ? ' '
I am fifteen , and she is twenty . '
Then the servant went back to the king , and told him all he knew .
And his majesty answered : ' I will have the fifteen-year-old one .
Go and bring her here . '
The servant returned a third time to the little house and knocked at the door .
In reply to his knock the lattice window was pushed open , and a voice inquired what it was he wanted .
` The king has desired me to bring back the youngest of you to become his queen , ' he replied .
` Tell his majesty I am ready to do his bidding , but since my birth no ray of light has fallen upon my face .
If it should ever do so I shall instantly grow black .
Therefore beg , I pray you , his most gracious majesty to send this evening a shut carriage , and I will return in it to the castle .
When the king heard this he ordered his great golden carriage to be prepared , and in it to be placed some magnificent robes ; and the old woman wrapped herself in a thick veil , and was driven to the castle .
The king was eagerly awaiting her , and when she arrived he begged her politely to raise her veil and let him see her face .
But she answered : ` Here the tapers are too bright and the light too strong .
Would you have me turn black under your very eyes ? '
And the king believed her words , and the marriage took place without the veil being once lifted .
Afterwards , when they were alone , he raised the corner , and knew for the first time that he had wedded a wrinkled old woman .
And , in a furious burst of anger , he dashed open the window and flung her out .
But , luckily for her , her clothes caught on a nail in the wall , and kept her hanging between heaven and earth .
While she was thus suspended , expecting every moment to be dashed to the ground , four fairies happened to pass by .
` Look , sisters , ' cried one , ` surely that is the old woman that the king sent for .
Shall we wish that her clothes may give way , and that she should be dashed to the ground ? '
` Oh no !
no ! '
exclaimed another .
` Let us wish her something good .
I myself will wish her youth . '
` And I beauty . '
` And I wisdom . '
` And I a tender heart . '
So spake the fairies , and went their way , leaving the most beautiful maiden in the world behind them .
The next morning when the king looked from his window he saw this lovely creature hanging on the nail .
` Ah !
what have I done ?
Surely I must have been blind last night ! '
And he ordered long ladders to be brought and the maiden to be rescued .
Then he fell on his knees before her , and prayed her to forgive him , and a great feast was made in her honour .
Some days after came the ninety-year-old sister to the palace and asked for the queen .
` Who is that hideous old witch ? '
said the king .
` Oh , an old neighbour of mine , who is half silly , ' she replied .
But the old woman looked at her steadily , and knew her again , and said : ` How have you managed to grow so young and beautiful ?
I should like to be young and beautiful too . '
This question she repeated the whole day long , till at length the queen lost patience and said : ' I had my old head cut off , and this new head grew in its place . '
Then the old woman went to a barber , and spoke to him , saying , ' I will give you all you ask if you will only cut off my head , so that I may become young and lovely . '
` But , my good woman , if I do that you will die ! '
But the old woman would listen to nothing ; and at last the barber took out his knife and struck the first blow at her neck .
` Ah ! '
she shrieked as she felt the pain .
` Il faut souffrir pour etre belle , ' said the barber , who had been in France .
And at the second blow her head rolled off , and the old woman was dead for good and all .
Catherine and Her Destiny Sicilianische Mahrchen von Laura Gonzenbach .
Leipzig , Engelmann , 1870 .
Long ago there lived a rich merchant who , besides possessing more treasures than any king in the world , had in his great hall three chairs , one of silver , one of gold , and one of diamonds .
But his greatest treasure of all was his only daughter , who was called Catherine .
One day Catherine was sitting in her own room when suddenly the door flew open , and in came a tall and beautiful woman holding in her hands a little wheel .
` Catherine , ' she said , going up to the girl , ` which would you rather have-a happy youth or a happy old age ? '
Catherine was so taken by surprise that she did not know what to answer , and the lady repeated again , ` Which would you rather have-a happy youth or a happy old age ? '
Then Catherine thought to herself , ` If I say a happy youth , then I shall have to suffer all the rest of my life .
No , I would bear trouble now , and have something better to look forward to . '
So she looked up and replied , ` Give me a happy old age . '
` So be it , ' said the lady , and turned her wheel as she spoke , vanishing the next moment as suddenly as she had come .
Now this beautiful lady was the Destiny of poor Catherine .
Only a few days after this the merchant heard the news that all his finest ships , laden with the richest merchandise , had been sunk in a storm , and he was left a beggar .
The shock was too much for him .
He took to his bed , and in a short time he was dead of his disappointment .
So poor Catherine was left alone in the world without a penny or a creature to help her .
But she was a brave girl and full of spirit , and soon made up her mind that the best thing she could do was to go to the nearest town and become a servant .
She lost no time in getting herself ready , and did not take long over her journey ; and as she was passing down the chief street of the town a noble lady saw her out of the window , and , struck by her sad face , said to her : ` Where are you going all alone , my pretty girl ? '
` Ah , my lady , I am very poor , and must go to service to earn my bread . ' '
I will take you into my service , ' said she ; and Catherine served her well .
Some time after her mistress said to Catherine , ' I am obliged to go out for a long while , and must lock the house door , so that no thieves shall get in . '
So she went away , and Catherine took her work and sat down at the window .
Suddenly the door burst open , and in came her Destiny .
` Oh !
so here you are , Catherine !
Did you really think I was going to leave you in peace ? '
And as she spoke she walked to the linen press where Catherine 's mistress kept all her finest sheets and underclothes , tore everything in pieces , and flung them on the floor .
Poor Catherine wrung her hands and wept , for she thought to herself , ` When my lady comes back and sees all this ruin she will think it is my fault , ' and starting up , she fled through the open door .
Then Destiny took all the pieces and made them whole again , and put them back in the press , and when everything was tidy she too left the house .
When the mistress reached home she called Catherine , but no Catherine was there .
` Can she have robbed me ? '
thought the old lady , and looked hastily round the house ; but nothing was missing .
She wondered why Catherine should have disappeared like this , but she heard no more of her , and in a few days she filled her place .
Meanwhile Catherine wandered on and on , without knowing very well where she was going , till at last she came to another town .
Just as before , a noble lady happened to see her passing her window , and called out to her , ` Where are you going all alone , my pretty girl ? '
And Catherine answered , ` Ah , my lady , I am very poor , and must go to service to earn my bread . ' '
I will take you into my service , ' said the lady ; and Catherine served her well , and hoped she might now be left in peace .
But , exactly as before , one day that Catherine was left in the house alone her Destiny came again and spoke to her with hard words : ` What !
are you here now ? '
And in a passion she tore up everything she saw , till in sheer misery poor Catherine rushed out of the house .
And so it befell for seven years , and directly Catherine found a fresh place her Destiny came and forced her to leave it .
After seven years , however , Destiny seemed to get tired of persecuting her , and a time of peace set in for Catherine .
When she had been chased away from her last house by Destiny 's wicked pranks she had taken service with another lady , who told her that it would be part of her daily work to walk to a mountain that overshadowed the town , and , climbing up to the top , she was to lay on the ground some loaves of freshly baked bread , and cry with a loud voice , ' O Destiny , my mistress , ' three times .
Then her lady 's Destiny would come and take away the offering .
` That will I gladly do , ' said Catherine .
So the years went by , and Catherine was still there , and every day she climbed the mountain with her basket of bread on her arm .
She was happier than she had been , but sometimes , when no one saw her , she would weep as she thought over her old life , and how different it was to the one she was now leading .
One day her lady saw her , and said , ` Catherine , what is it ?
Why are you always weeping ? '
And then Catherine told her story . '
I have got an idea , ' exclaimed the lady .
` To-morrow , when you take the bread to the mountain , you shall pray my Destiny to speak to yours , and entreat her to leave you in peace .
Perhaps something may come of it ! '
At these words Catherine dried her eyes , and next morning , when she climbed the mountain , she told all she had suffered , and cried , ' O Destiny , my mistress , pray , I entreat you , of my Destiny that she may leave me in peace . '
And Destiny answered , ` Oh , my poor girl , know you not your Destiny lies buried under seven coverlids , and can hear nothing ?
But if you will come to-morrow I will bring her with me . '
And after Catherine had gone her way her lady 's Destiny went to find her sister , and said to her , ` Dear sister , has not Catherine suffered enough ?
It is surely time for her good days to begin ? '
And the sister answered , ` To-morrow you shall bring her to me , and I will give her something that may help her out of her need . '
The next morning Catherine set out earlier than usual for the mountain , and her lady 's Destiny took the girl by the hand and led her to her sister , who lay under the seven coverlids .
And her Destiny held out to Catherine a ball of silk , saying , ` Keep this -- it may be useful some day ; ' then pulled the coverings over her head again .
But Catherine walked sadly down the hill , and went straight to her lady and showed her the silken ball , which was the end of all her high hopes .
` What shall I do with it ? '
she asked .
` It is not worth sixpence , and it is no good to me ! '
` Take care of it , ' replied her mistress .
` Who can tell how useful it may be ? '
A little while after this grand preparations were made for the king 's marriage , and all the tailors in the town were busy embroidering fine clothes .
The wedding garment was so beautiful nothing like it had ever been seen before , but when it was almost finished the tailor found that he had no more silk .
The colour was very rare , and none could be found like it , and the king made a proclamation that if anyone happened to possess any they should bring it to the court , and he would give them a large sum .
` Catherine ! '
exclaimed the lady , who had been to the tailors and seen the wedding garment , ` your ball of silk is exactly the right colour .
Bring it to the king , and you can ask what you like for it . '
Then Catherine put on her best clothes and went to the court , and looked more beautiful than any woman there .
` May it please your majesty , ' she said , ' I have brought you a ball of silk of the colour you asked for , as no one else has any in the town . '
` Your majesty , ' asked one of the courtiers , ` shall I give the maiden its weight in gold ? '
The king agreed , and a pair of scales were brought ; and a handful of gold was placed in one scale and the silken ball in the other .
But lo !
let the king lay in the scales as many gold pieces as he would , the silk was always heavier still .
Then the king took some larger scales , and heaped up all his treasures on one side , but the silk on the other outweighed them all .
At last there was only one thing left that had not been put in , and that was his golden crown .
And he took it from his head and set it on top of all , and at last the scale moved and the ball had founds its balance .
` Where got you this silk ? '
asked the king .
` It was given me , royal majesty , by my mistress , ' replied Catherine .
` That is not true , ' said the king , ` and if you do not tell me the truth I will have your head cut off this instant . '
So Catherine told him the whole story , and how she had once been as rich as he .
Now there lived at the court a wise woman , and she said to Catherine , ` You have suffered much , my poor girl , but at length your luck has turned , and I know by the weighing of the scales through the crown that you will die a queen . '
` So she shall , ' cried the king , who overheard these words ; ` she shall die my queen , for she is more beautiful than all the ladies of the court , and I will marry no one else . '
And so it fell out .
The king sent back the bride he had promised to wed to her own country , and the same Catherine was queen at the marriage feast instead , and lived happy and contented to the end of her life .
How the Hermit Helped to Win the King 's Daughter Sicilianische Mahrchen Long ago there lived a very rich man who had three sons .
When he felt himself to be dying he divided his property between them , making them share alike , both in money and lands .
Soon after he died the king set forth a proclamation through the whole country that whoever could build a ship that should float both on land and sea should have his daughter to wife .
The eldest brother , when he heard it , said to the other , ' I think I will spend some of my money in trying to build that ship , as I should like to have the king for my father-in-law . '
So he called together all the shipbuilders in the land , and gave them orders to begin the ship without delay .
And trees were cut down , and great preparations made , and in a few days everybody knew what it was all for ; and there was a crowd of old people pressing round the gates of the yard , where the young man spent the most of his day .
` Ah , master , give us work , ' they said , ` so that we may earn our bread . '
But he only gave them hard words , and spoke roughly to them .
` You are old , and have lost your strength ; of what use are you ? '
And he drove them away .
Then came some boys and prayed him , `` master , give us work , ' but he answered them , ` Of what use can you be , weaklings as you are !
Get you gone ! '
And if any presented themselves that were not skilled workmen he would have none of them .
At last there knocked at the gate a little old man with a long white beard , and said , ` Will you give me work , so that I may earn my bread ? '
But he was only driven away like the rest .
The ship took a long while to build , and cost a great deal of money , and when it was launched a sudden squall rose , and it fell to pieces , and with it all the young man 's hopes of winning the princess .
By this time he had not a penny left , so he went back to his two brothers and told his tale .
And the second brother said to himself as he listened , ` Certainly he has managed very badly , but I should like to see if I ca n't do better , and win the princess for my own self . '
So he called together all the shipbuilders throughout the country , and gave them orders to build a ship which should float on the land as well as on the sea .
But his heart was no softer than his brother 's , and every man that was not a skilled workman was chased away with hard words .
Last came the white-bearded man , but he fared no better than the rest .
When the ship was finished the launch took place , and everything seemed going smoothly when a gale sprang up , and the vessel was dashed to pieces on the rocks .
The young man had spent his whole fortune on it , and now it was all swallowed up , was forced to beg shelter from his youngest brother .
When he told his story the youngest said to himself , ' I am not rich enough to support us all three .
I had better take my turn , and if I manage to win the princess there will be her fortune as well as my own for us to live on . '
So he called together all the shipbuilders in the kingdom , and gave orders that a new ship should be built .
Then all the old people came and asked for work , and he answered cheerfully , ` Oh , yes , there is plenty for everybody ; ' and when the boys begged to be allowed to help he found something that they could do .
And when the old man with the long white beard stood before him , praying that he might earn his bread , he replied , ` Oh , father , I could not suffer you to work , but you shall be overseer , and look after the rest . '
Now the old man was a holy hermit , and when he saw how kind-hearted the youth was he determined to do all he could for him to gain the wish of his heart .
By-and-bye , when the ship was finished , the hermit said to his young friend , ` Now you can go and claim the king 's daughter , for hte ship will float both by land and sea . '
` Oh , good father , ' cried the young man , ` you will not forsake me ?
Stay with me , I pray you , and lead me to the king ! '
` If you wish it , I will , ' said the hermit , ` on condition that you will give me half of anything you get . '
` Oh , if that is all , ' answered he , ` it is easily promised ! '
And they set out together on the ship .
After they had gone some distance they saw a man standing in a thick fog , which he was trying to put into a sack .
` Oh , good father , ' exclaimed the youth , ` what can he be doing ? '
` Ask him , ' said the old man .
` What are you doing , my fine fellow ? ' '
I am putting the fog into my sack .
That is my business . '
` Ask him if he will come with us , ' whispered the hermit .
And the man answered : ` If you will give me enough to eat and drink I will gladly stay with you . '
So they took him on their ship , and the youth said , as they started off again , ` Good father , before we were two , and now we are three ! '
After they had travelled a little further they met a man who had torn up half the forest , and was carrying all the trees on his shoulders .
` Good father , ' exclaimed the youth , ` only look !
What can he have done that for ? '
` Ask him why he has torn up all those trees . '
And the man replied , ` Why , I 've merely been gathering a handful of brushwood . '
` Beg him to come with us , ' whispered the hermit .
And the strong man answered : ` Willingly , as long as you give me enough to eat and drink . '
And he came on the ship .
And the youth said to the hermit , ` Good father , before we were three , and now we are four . '
The ship travelled on again , and some miles further on they saw a man drinking out of a stream till he had nearly drunk it dry .
` Good father , ' said the youth , ` just look at that man !
Did you ever see anybody drink like that ? '
` Ask him why he does it , ' answered the hermit .
` Why , there is nothing very odd in taking a mouthful of water ! '
replied the man , standing up .
` Beg him to come with us . '
And the youth did so .
` With pleasure , as long as you give me enough to eat and drink . '
And the youth whispered to the hermit , ` Good father , before we were four , and now we are five . '
A little way along they noticed another man in the middle of a stream , who was shooting into the water .
` Good father , ' said the youth , ` what can he be shooting at ? '
` Ask him , ' answered the hermit .
` Hush , hush ! '
cried the man ; ` now you have frightened it away .
In the Underworld sits a quail on a tree , and I wanted to shoot it .
That is my business .
I hit everything I aim at . '
` Ask him if he will come with us . '
And the man replied , ` With all my heart , as long as I get enough to eat and drink . '
So they took him into the ship , and the young man whispered , ` Good father , before we were five , and now we are six . '
Off they went again , and before they had gone far they met a man striding towards them whose steps were so long that while one foot was on the north of the island the other was right down in the south .
` Good father , look at him !
What long steps he takes ! '
` Ask him why he does it , ' replied the hermit .
` Oh , I am only going out for a little walk , ' answered he .
` Ask him if he will come with us . '
` Gladly , if you will give me as much as I want to eat and drink , ' said he , climbing up into the ship .
And the young man whispered , ` Good father , before we were six , and now we are seven . '
But the hermit knew what he was about , and why he gathered these strange people into the ship .
After many days , at last they reached the town where lived the king and his daughter .
They stopped the vessel right in front of the palace , and the young man went in and bowed low before the king . '
O Majesty , I have done your bidding , and now is the ship built that can travel over land and sea .
Give me my reward , and let me have your daughter to wife . '
But the king said to himself , ` What !
am I to wed my daughter to a man of whom I know nothing .
Not even whether he be rich or poor -- a knight or a beggar . '
And aloud he spake : It is not enough that you have managed to build the ship .
You must find a runner who shall take this letter to the ruler of the Underworld , and bring me the answer back in an hour . '
` That is not in the bond , ' answered the young man .
` Well , do as you like , ' replied the king , ` only you will not get my daughter . '
The young man went out , sorely troubled , to tell his old friend what had happened .
` Silly boy ! '
cried the hermit , ` Accept his terms at once .
And send off the long-legged man with the letter .
He will take it in no time at all . '
So the youth 's heard leapt for joy , and he returned to the king .
` Majesty , I accept your terms .
HEre is the messenger who will do what you wish . '
The king had no choice but to give the man the letter , and he strode off , making short work of the distance that lay between the palace and the Underworld .
He soon found the ruler , who looked at the letter , and said to him , ` Wait a little while i write the answer ; ' but the man was soo tired with his quick walk that he went sound asleep and forgot all about his errand .
All this time the youth was anxiously counting the minutes till he could get back , and stood with his eyes fixed on the road down which his messenger must come .
` What can be keeping him , ' he said to the hermit when the hour was nearly up .
Then the hermit sent for the man who could hit everything he aimed at , and said to him , ` Just see why the messenger stays so long . '
` Oh , he is sound asleep in the palace of the Underworld .
However , I can wake him . '
Then he drew his bow , and shot an arrow straight into the man 's knee .
The messenger awoke with such a start , and when he saw that the hour had almost run out he snatched up the answer and rushed back with such speed that the clock had not yet struck when he entered the palace .
Now the young man thought he was sure of his bride , but the king said , `` Still you have not done enough .
Before I give you my daughter you must find a man who can drink half the contents of my cellar in one day . '
` That is not in the bond , ' complained the poor youth .
` Well , do as you like , only you will not get my daughter . '
The young man went sadly out , and asked the hermit what he was to do .
` Silly boy ! '
said he .
` Why , tell the man to do it who drinks up everything . '
So they sent for the man and said , ` Do you think you are able to drink half the royal cellar in one day ? '
` Dear me , yes , and as much more as you want , ' answered he . '
I am never satisfied . '
The king was not pleased at the young man agreeing so readily , but he had no choice , and ordered the servant to be taken downstairs .
Oh , how he enjoyed himself !
All day long he drank , and drank , and drank , till instead of half the cellar , he had drunk the whole , and there was not a cask but what stood empty .
And when the king saw this he said to the youth , ` You have conquered , and I can no longer withhold my daughter .
But , as her dowry , I shall only give so much as one man can carry away . '
` But , ' answered he , ` let a man be ever so strong , he can not carry more than a hundredweight , and what is that for a king 's daughter ? '
` Well , do as you like ; I have said my say .
It is your affair -- not mine . '
The young man was puzzled , and did not know what to reply , for , though he would gladly have married the princess without a sixpence , he had spent all his money in building the ship , and knew he could not give her all she wanted .
So he went to the hermit and said to him , ` The king will only give for her dowry as much as a man can carry .
I have no money of my own left , and my brothers have none either . '
` Silly boy !
Why , you have only got to fetch the man who carried half the forest on his shoulders . '
And the youth was glad , and called the strong man , and told him what he must do .
` Take everything you can , till you are bent double .
Never mind if you leave the palace bare . '
The strong man promised , and nobly kept his word .
He piled all he could see on his back -- chairs , tables , wardrobes , chests of gold and silver -- till there was nothing left to pile .
At last he took the king 's crown , and put it on the top .
He carried his burden to the ship and stowed his treasures away , and the youth followed , leading the king 's daughter .
But the king was left raging in his empty palace , and he called together his army , and got ready his ships of war , in order that he might go after the vessel and bring back what had been taken away .
And the king 's ships sailed very fast , and soon caught up the little vessel , and the sailors all shouted for joy .
Then the hermit looked out and saw how near they were , and he said to the youth , ` Do you see that ? '
The youth shrieked and cried , ` Ah , good father , it is a fleet of ships , and they are chasing us , and in a few moments they will be upon us . '
But the hermit bade him call the man who had the fog in his sack , and the sack was opened and the fog flew out , and hung right round the king 's ships , so that they could see nothing .
So they sailed back to the palace , and told the king what strange things had happened .
Meanwhile the young man 's vessel reached home in safety .
` Well , here you are once more ' said the hermit ; ` and now you can fulfil the promise you made me to give me the half of all you had . '
` That will I do with all my heart , ' answered the youth , and began to divide all his treasures , putting part on one side for himself and setting aside the other for his friend .
` Good father , it is finished , ' said he at length ; ` there is nothing more left to divide . '
` Nothing more left ! '
cried the hermit .
` Why , you have forgotten the best thing of all ! '
` What can that be ? '
asked he .
` We have divided everything . '
` And the king 's daughter ? '
said the hermit .
Then the young man 's heart stood still , for he loved her dearly .
But he answered , ` It is well ; I have sworn , and I will keep my word , ' and drew his sword to cut her in pieces .
When the hermit saw that he held his honour dearer than his wife he lifted his hand and cried , ` Hold !
she is yours , and all the treasures too .
I gave you my help because you had pity on those that were in need .
And when you are in need yourself , call upon me , and I will come to you . '
As he spoke he softly touched their heads and vanished .
The next day the wedding took place , and the two brothers came to the house , and they all lived happily together , but they never forgot the holy man who had been such a good friend .
The Water of Life Cuentos Populars Catalans , per lo Dr. D. Francisco de S. Maspous y Labros .
Barcelona , 1885 .
Three brothers and one sister lived together in a small cottage , and they loved one another dearly .
One day the eldest brother , who had never done anything but amuse himself from sunrise to sunset , said to the rest , ` Let us all work hard , and perhaps we shall grow rich , and be able to build ourselves a palace . '
And his brothers and sister answered joyfully , ` Yes , we will all work ! '
So they fell to working with all their might , till at last they became rich , and were able to build themselves a beautiful palace ; and everyone came from miles round to see its wonders , and to say how splendid it was .
No one thought of finding any faults , till at length an old woman , who had been walking through the rooms with a crowd of people , suddenly exclaimed , ` Yes , it is a splendid palace , but there is still something it needs ! '
` And what may that be ? ' '
A church . '
When they heard this the brothers set to work again to earn some more money , and when they had got enough they set about building a church , which should be as large and beautiful as the palace itself .
And after the church was finished greater numbers of people than ever flocked to see the palace and the church and vast gardens and magnificent halls .
But one day , as the brothers were as usual doing the honours to their guests , an old man turned to them and said , ` Yes , it is all most beautiful , but there is still something it needs ! '
` And what may that be ? ' '
A pitcher of the water of life , a branch of the tree the smell of whose flowers gives eternal beauty , and the talking bird . '
` And where am I to find all those ? '
` Go to the mountain that is far off yonder , and you will find what you seek . '
After the old man had bowed politely and taken farewell of them the eldest brother said to the rest , ' I will go in search of the water of life , and the talking bird , and the tree of beauty . '
` But suppose some evil thing befalls you ? '
asked his sister .
` How shall we know ? '
` You are right , ' he replied ; ' I had not thought of that ! '
Then they followed the old man , and said to him , ` My eldest brother wishes to seek for the water of life , and the tree of beauty , and the talking bird , that you tell him are needful to make our palace perfect .
But how shall we know if any evil thing befall him ? '
So the old man took them a knife , and gave it to them , saying , ` Keep this carefully , and as long as the blade is bright all is well ; but if the blade is bloody , then know that evil has befallen him . '
The brothers thanked him , and departed , and went straight to the palace , where they found the young man making ready to set out for the mountain where the treasures he longed for lay hid .
And he walked , and he walked , and he walked , till he had gone a great way , and there he met a giant .
` Can you tell me how much further I have still to go before I reach that mountain yonder ? '
` And why do you wish to go there ? ' '
I am seeking the water of life , the talking bird , and a branch of the tree of beauty . '
` Many have passed by seeking those treasures , but none have ever come back ; and you will never come back either , unless you mark my words .
Follow this path , and when you reach the mountain you will find it covered with stones .
Do not stop to look at them , but keep on your way .
As you go you will hear scoffs and laughs behind you ; it will be the stones that mock .
Do not heed them ; above all , do not turn round .
If you do you will become as one of them .
Walk straight on till you get to the top , and then take all you wish for . '
The young man thanked him for his counsel , and walked , and walked , and walked , till he reached the mountain .
And as he climbed he heard behind him scoffs and jeers , but he kept his ears steadily closed to them .
At last the noise grew so loud that he lost patience , and he stooped to pick up a stone to hurl into the midst of the clamour , when suddenly his arm seemed to stiffen , and the next moment he was a stone himself !
That day his sister , who thought her brother 's steps were long in returning , took out the knife and found the blade was red as blood .
Then she cried out to her brothers that something terrible had come to pass . '
I will go and find him , ' said the second .
And he went .
And he walked , and he walked , and he walked , till he met the giant , and asked him if he had seen a young man travelling towards the mountain .
And the giant answered , ` Yes , I have seen him pass , but I have not seen him come back .
The spell must have worked upon him . '
` Then what can I do to disenchant him , and find the water of life , the talking bird , and a branch of the tree of beauty ? '
` Follow this path , and when you reach the mountain you will find it covered with stones .
Do not stop to look at them , but climb steadily on .
Above all , heed not the laughs and scoffs that will arise on all sides , and never turn round .
And when you reach the top you can then take all you desire . '
The young man thanked him for his counsel , and set out for the mountain .
But no sooner did he reach it than loud jests and gibes broke out on every side , and almost deafened him .
For some time he let them rail , and pushed boldly on , till he had passed the place which his brother had gained ; then suddenly he thought that among the scoffing sounds he heard his brother 's voice .
He stopped and looked back ; and another stone was added to the number .
Meanwhile the sister left at home was counting the days when her two brothers should return to her .
The time seemed long , and it would be hard to say how often she took out the knife and looked at its polished blade to make sure that this one at least was still safe .
The blade was always bright and clear ; each time she looked she had the happiness of knowing that all was well , till one evening , tired and anxious , as she frequently was at the end of the day , she took it from its drawer , and behold !
the blade was red with blood .
Her cry of horror brought her youngest brother to her , and , unable to speak , she held out the knife ! '
I will go , ' he said .
So he walked , and he walked , and he walked , until he met the giant , and he asked , ` Have two young men , making for yonder mountain , passed this way ? '
And the giant answered , ` Yes , they have passed by , but they never came back , and by this I know that the spell has fallen upon them . '
` Then what must I do to free them , and to get the water of life , and the talking bird , and the branch of the tree of beauty ? '
` Go to the mountain , which you will find so thickly covered with stones that you will hardly be able to place your feet , and walk straight forward , turning neither to the right hand nor to the left , and paying no heed to the laughs and scoffs which will follow you , till you reach the top , and then you may take all that you desire . '
The young man thanked the giant for his counsel , and set forth to the mountain .
And when he began to climb there burst forth all around him a storm of scoffs and jeers ; but he thought of the giant 's words , and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left , till the mountain top lay straight before him .
A moment now and he would have gained it , when , through the groans and yells , he heard his brothers ' voices .
He turned , and there was one stone the more .
And all this while his sister was pacing up and down the palace , hardly letting the knife out of her hand , and dreading what she knew she would see , and what she did see .
The blade grew red before her eyes , and she said , ` Now it is my turn . '
So she walked , and she walked , and she walked till she came to the giant , and prayed him to tell her if he had seen three young men pass that way seeking the distant mountain . '
I have seen them pass , but they have never returned , and by this I know that the spell has fallen upon them . '
` And what must I do to set them free , and to find the water of life , and the talking bird , and a branch of the tree of beauty ? '
` You must go to that mountain , which is so full of stones that your feet will hardly find a place to tread , and as you climb you will hear a noise as if all the stones in the world were mocking you ; but pay no heed to anything you may hear , and , once you gain the top , you have gained everything . '
The girl thanked him for his counsel , and set out for the mountain ; and scarcely had she gone a few steps upwards when cries and screams broke forth around her , and she felt as if each stone she trod on was a living thing .
But she remembered the words of the giant , and knew not what had befallen her brothers , and kept her face steadily towards the mountain top , which grew nearer and nearer every moment .
But as she mounted the clamour increased sevenfold : high above them all rang the voices of her three brothers .
But the girl took no heed , and at last her feet stood upon the top .
Then she looked round , and saw , lying in a hollow , the pool of the water of life .
And she took the brazen pitcher that she had brought with her , and filled it to the brim .
By the side of the pool stood the tree of beauty , with the talking bird on one of its boughs ; and she caught the bird , and placed it in a cage , and broke off one of the branches .
After that she turned , and went joyfully down the hill again , carrying her treasures , but her long climb had tired her out , and the brazen pitcher was very heavy , and as she walked a few drops of the water spilt on the stones , and as it touched them they changed into young men and maidens , crowding about her to give thanks for their deliverance .
So she learnt by this how the evil spell might be broken , and she carefully sprinkled every stone till there was not one left -- only a great company of youths and girls who followed her down the mountain .
When they arrived at the palace she did not lose a moment in planting the branch of the tree of beauty and watering it with the water of life .
And the branch shot up into a tree , and was heavy with flowers , and the talking bird nestled in its branches .
Now the fame of these wonders was noised abroad , and the people flocked in great numbers to see the three marvels , and the maiden who had won them ; and among the sightseers came the king 's son , who would not go till everything was shown him , and till he had heard how it had all happened .
And the prince admired the strangeness and beauty of the treasures in the palace , but more than all he admired the beauty and courage of the maiden who had brought them there .
So he went home and told his parents , and gained their consent to wed her for his wife .
Then the marriage was celebrated in the church adjoining the palace .
Then the bridegroom took her to his own home , where they lived happy for ever after .
The Wounded Lion Cuentos Populars Catalans .
There was once a girl so poor that she had nothing to live on , and wandered about the world asking for charity .
One day she arrived at a thatched cottage , and inquired if they could give her any work .
The farmer said he wanted a cowherd , as his own had left him , and if the girl liked the place she might take it .
So she became a cowherd .
One morning she was driving her cows through the meadows when she heard near by a loud groan that almost sounded human .
She hastened to the spot from which the noise came , and found it proceeded from a lion who lay stretched upon the ground .
You can guess how frightened she was !
But the lion seemed in such pain that she was sorry for him , and drew nearer and nearer till she saw he had a large thorn in one foot .
She pulled out the thorn and bound up the place , and the lion was grateful , and licked her hand by way of thanks with his big rough tongue .
When the girl had finished she went back to find the cows , but they had gone , and though she hunted everywhere she never found them ; and she had to return home and confess to her master , who scolded her bitterly , and afterwards beat her .
Then he said , ` Now you will have to look after the asses . '
So every day she had to take the asses to the woods to feed , until one morning , exactly a year after she had found the lion , she heard a groan which sounded quite human .
She went straight to the place from which the noise came , and , to her great surprise , beheld the same lion stretched on the ground with a deep wound across his face .
This time she was not afraid at all , and ran towards him , washing the wound and laying soothing herbs upon it ; and when she had bound it up the lion thanked her in the same manner as before .
After that she returned to her flock , but they were nowhere to be seen .
She searched here and she searched there , but they had vanished completely !
Then she had to go home and confess to her master , who first scolded her and afterwards beat her .
` Now go , ' he ended , ` and look after the pigs ! '
So the next day she took out the pigs , and found them such good feeding grounds that they grew fatter every day .
Another year passed by , and one morning when the maiden was out with her pigs she heard a groan which sounded quite human .
She ran to see what it was , and found her old friend the lion , wounded through and through , fast dying under a tree .
She fell on her knees before him and washed his wounds one by one , and laid healing herbs upon them .
And the lion licked her hands and thanked her , and asked if she would not stay and sit by him .
But the girl said she had her pigs to watch , and she must go and see after them .
So she ran to the place where she had left them , but they had vanished as if the earth had swallowed them up .
She whistled and called , but only the birds answered her .
Then she sank down on the ground and wept bitterly , not daring to return home until some hours had passed away .
And when she had had her cry out she got up and searched all up and down the wood .
But it was no use ; there was not a sign of the pigs .
At last she thought that perhaps if she climbed a tree she might see further .
But no sooner was she seated on the highest branch than something happened which put the pigs quite out of her head .
This was a handsome young man who was coming down the path ; and when he had almost reached the tree he pulled aside a rock and disappeared behind it .
The maiden rubbed her eyes and wondered if she had been dreaming .
Next she thought , ' I will not stir from here till I see him come out , and discover who he is . '
Accordingly she waited , and at dawn the next morning the rock moved to one side and a lion came out .
When he had gone quite out of sight the girl climbed down from the tree and went to the rock , which she pushed aside , and entered the opening before her .
The path led to a beautiful house .
She went in , swept and dusted the furniture , and put everything tidy .
Then she ate a very good dinner , which was on a shelf in the corner , and once more clambered up to the top of her tree .
As the sun set she saw the same young man walking gaily down the path , and , as before , he pushed aside the rock and disappeared behind it .
Next morning out came the lion .
He looked sharply about him on all sides , but saw no one , and then vanished into the forest .
The maiden then came down from the tree and did exactly as she had done the day before .
Thus three days went by , and every day she went and tidied up the palace .
At length , when the girl found she was no nearer to discovering the secret , she resolved to ask him , and in the evening when she caught sight of him coming through the wood she came down from the tree and begged him to tell her his name .
The young man looked very pleased to see her , and said he thought it must be she who had secretly kept his house for so many days .
And he added that he was a prince enchanted by a powerful giant , but was only allowed to take his own shape at night , for all day he was forced to appear as the lion whom she had so often helped ; and , more than this , it was the giant who had stolen the oxen and the asses and the pigs in revenge for her kindness .
And the girl asked him , ` What can I do to disenchant you ? '
But he said he was afraid it was very difficult , because the only way was to get a lock of hair from the head of a king 's daughter , to spin it , and to make from it a cloak for the giant , who lived up on the top of a high mountain .
` Very well , ' answered the girl , ' I will go to the city , and knock at the door of the king 's palace , and ask the princess to take me as a servant . '
So they parted , and when she arrived at the city she walked about the streets crying , ` Who will hire me for a servant ?
Who will hire me for a servant ? '
But , though many people liked her looks , for she was clean and neat , the maiden would listen to none , and still continued crying , ` Who will hire me for a servant ?
Who will hire me for a servant ? '
At last there came the waiting-maid of the princess .
` What can you do ? '
she said ; and the girl was forced to confess that she could do very little .
` Then you will have to do scullion 's work , and wash up dishes , ' said she ; and they went straight back to the palace .
Then the maiden dressed her hair afresh , and made herself look very neat and smart , and everyone admired and praised her , till by-and-bye it came to the ears of the princess .
And she sent for the girl , and when she saw her , and how beautifully she had dressed her hair , the princess told her she was to come and comb out hers .
Now the hair of the princess was very thick and long , and shone like the sun .
And the girl combed it and combed it till it was brighter than ever .
And the princess was pleased , and bade her come every day and comb her hair , till at length the girl took courage , and begged leave to cut off one of the long , thick locks .
The princess , who was very proud of her hair , did not like the idea of parting with any of it , so she said no .
But the girl could not give up hope , and each day she entreated to be allowed to cut off just one tress .
At length the princess lost patience , and exclaimed , ` You may have it , then , on condition that you shall find the handsomest prince in the world to be my bridegroom ! '
And the girl answered that she would , and cut off the lock , and wove it into a coat that glittered like silk , and brought it to the young man , who told her to carry it straight to the giant .
But that she must be careful to cry out a long way off what she had with her , or else he would spring upon her and run her through with his sword .
So the maiden departed and climbed up the mountain , but before she reached the top the giant heard her footsteps , and rushed out breathing fire and flame , having a sword in one hand and a club in the other .
But she cried loudly that she had brought him the coat , and then he grew quiet , and invited her to come into his house .
He tried on the coat , but it was too short , and he threw it off , and declared it was no use .
And the girl picked it up sadly , and returned quite in despair to the king 's palace .
The next morning , when she was combing the princess 's hair , she begged leave to cut off another lock .
At first the princess said no , but the girl begged so hard that at length she gave in on condition that she should find her a prince as bridegroom .
The maiden told her that she had already found him , and spun the lock into shining stuff , and fastened it on to the end of the coat .
And when it was finished she carried it to the giant .
This time it fitted him , and he was quite pleased , and asked her what he could give her in return .
And she said that the only reward he could give her was to take the spell off the lion and bring him back to his own shape .
For a long time the giant would not hear of it , but in the end he gave in , and told her exactly how it must all be done .
She was to kill the lion herself and cut him up very small ; then she must burn him , and cast his ashes into the water , and out of the water the prince would come free from enchantment for ever .
But the maiden went away weeping , lest the giant should have deceived her , and that after she had killed the lion she would find she had also slain the prince .
Weeping she came down the mountain , and weeping she joined the prince , who was awaiting her at the bottom ; and when he had heard her story he comforted her , and bade her be of good courage , and to do the bidding of the giant .
And the maiden believed what the prince told her ; and in the morning when he put on his lion 's form she took a knife and slew him , and cut him up very small , and burnt him , and cast his ashes into the water , and out of the water came the prince , beautiful as the day , and as glad to look upon as the sun himself .
Then the young man thanked the maiden for all she had done for him , and said she should be his wife and none other .
But the maiden only wept sore , and answered that that she could never be , for she had given her promise to the princess when she cut off her hair that the prince should wed her and her only .
But the prince replied , ` If it is the princess , we must go quickly .
Come with me . '
So they went together to the king 's palace .
And when the king and queen and princess saw the young man a great joy filled their hearts , for they knew him for the eldest son , who had long ago been enchanted by a giant and lost to them .
And he asked his parents ' consent that he might marry the girl who had saved him , and a great feast was made , and the maiden became a princess , and in due time a queen , and she richly deserved all the honours showered upon her .
The Man Without a Heart Once upon a time there were seven brothers , who were orphans , and had no sister .
Therefore they were obliged to do all their own housework .
This they did not like at all ; so after much deliberation they decided to get married .
There were , unfortunately , no young girls to be found in the place where they lived ; but the elder brothers agreed to go out into the world and seek for brides , promising to bring back a very pretty wife for the youngest also if he would meanwhile stay at home and take care of the house .
He consented willingly , and the six young men set off in good spirits .
On their way they came to a small cottage standing quite by itself in a wood ; and before the door stood an old , old man , who accosted the brothers saying , ` Hullo , you young fellows !
Whither away so fast and cheerily ? '
` We are going to find bonny brides for ourselves , and one for our youngest brother at home , ' they replied .
` Oh !
dear youths , ' said the old man , ' I am terribly lonely here ; pray bring a bride for me also ; only remember , she must be young and pretty . '
` What does a shrivelled old grey thing like that want with a pretty young bride ? '
thought the brothers , and went on their way .
Presently they came to a town where were seven sisters , as young and as lovely as anyone could wish .
Each brother chose one , and the youngest they kept for their brother at home .
Then the whole party set out on the return journey , and again their path led through the wood and past the old man 's cottage .
There he stood before the door , and cried : ` Oh !
you fine fellows , what a charming bride you have brought me ! '
` She is not for you , said the young men .
` She is for our youngest brother , as we promised . '
` What ! '
said the old man , ` promised !
I 'll make you eat your promises ! '
And with that he took his magic wand , and , murmuring a charm , he touched both brothers and brides , and immediately they were turned into grey stones .
Only the youngest sister he had not bewitched .
He took her into the cottage , and from that time she was obliged to keep house for him .
She was not very unhappy , but one thought troubled her .
What if the old man should die and leave her here alone in the solitary cottage deep in the heart of the wood !
She would be as ` terribly lonely ' as he had formerly been .
One day she told him of her fear .
` Do n't be anxious , ' he said .
` You need neither fear my death nor desire it , for I have no heart in my breast !
However , if I should die , you will find my wand above the door , and with it you can set free your sisters and their lovers .
Then you will surely have company enough . '
` Where in all the world do you keep your heart , if not in your breast ? '
asked the girl .
` Do you want to know everything ? '
her husband said .
` Well , if you must know , my heart is in the bed-cover . '
When the old man had gone out about his business his bride passed her time in embroidering beautiful flowers on the bed quilt to make his heart happy .
The old man was much amused .
He laughed , and said to her : ` You are a good child , but I was only joking .
My heart is really in -- in -- ' ` Now where is it , dear husband ? '
` It is in the doorway , ' he replied .
Next day , while he was out , the girl decorated the door with gay feathers and fresh flowers , and hung garlands upon it .
And on his return the old fellow asked what it all meant . '
I did it to show my love for your heart , ' said the girl .
And again the old man smiled , saying , ` You are a dear child , but my heart is not in the doorway . '
Then the poor young bride was very vexed , and said , ` Ah , my dear !
you really have a heart somewhere , so you may die and leave me all alone . '
The old man did his best to comfort her by repeating all he had said before , but she begged him afresh to tell her truly where his heart was and at last he told her .
` Far , far from here , ' said he , ` in a lonely spot , stands a great church , as old as old can be .
Its doors are of iron , and round it runs a deep moat , spanned by no bridge .
Within that church is a bird which flies up and down ; it never eats , and never drinks , and never dies .
No one can catch it , and while that bird lives so shall I , for in it is my heart . '
It made the little bride quite sad to think she could do nothing to show her love for the old man 's heart .
She used to think about it as she sat all alone during the long days , for her husband was almost always out .
One day a young traveller came past the house , and seeing such a pretty girl he wished her ` Good day . '
She returned his greeting , and as he drew near she asked him whence he came and where he was going .
` Alas ! '
sighed the youth , ' I am very sorrowful .
I had six brothers , who went away to find brides for themselves and one for me ; but they have never come home , so now I am going to look for them . '
` Oh , good friend , ' said the girl , ` you need go no farther .
Come , sit down , eat and drink , and afterwards I 'll tell you all about it . '
She gave him food , and when he had finished his meal she told him how his brothers had come to the town where she lived with her sisters , how they had each chosen a bride , and , taking herself with them , had started for home .
She wept as she told how the others were turned to stone , and how she was kept as the old man 's bride .
She left out nothing , even telling him the story of her husband 's heart .
When the young man heard this he said : ' I shall go in search of the bird .
It may be that God will help me to find and catch it . '
` Yes , do go , ' she said ; ` it will be a good deed , for then you can set your brothers and my sisters free . '
Then she hid the young man , for it was now late , and her husband would soon be home .
Next morning , when the old man had gone out , she prepared a supply of provisions for her guest , and sent him off on his travels , wishing him good luck and success .
He walked on and on till he thought it must be time for breakfast ; so he opened his knapsack , and was delighted to find such a store of good things .
` What a feast ! '
he exclaimed ; ` will anyone come and share it ? '
` Moo-oo , ' sounded close behind him , and looking round he saw a great red ox , which said , ' I have much pleasure in accepting your kind invitation . '
` I 'm delighted to see you .
Pray help yourself .
All I have is at your service , ' said the hospitable youth .
And the ox lay down comfortably , licking his lips , and made a hearty meal .
` Many thanks to you , ' said the animal as it rose up .
` When you are in danger or necessity call me , even if only by a thought , ' and it disappeared among the bushes .
The young man packed up all the food that was left , and wandered on till the shortening shadows and his own hunger warned him that it was midday .
he laid the cloth on the ground and spread out his provisions , saying at the same time : ` Dinner is ready , and anyone who wishes to share it is welcome . '
Then there was a great rustling in the undergrowth , and out ran a wild boar , grunting , ` Umph , umph , umph ; someone said dinner was ready .
Was it you ?
and did you mean me to come ? '
` By all means .
Help yourself to what I have , ' said the young traveller .
And the two enjoyed their meal together .
Afterwards the boar got up , saying , ` Thank you ; when in need you be you must quickly call for me , ' and he rolled off .
For a long time the youth walked on .
By evening he was miles away .
He felt hungry again , and , having still some provisions left , thought he had better make ready his supper .
When it was all spread out he cried as before , ` Anyone who cares to share my meal is welcome . '
He heard a sound overhead like the flapping of wings , and a shadow was cast upon the ground .
Then a huge griffin appeared , saying : ' I heard someone giving an invitation to eat ; is there anything for me ? '
` Why not ? '
said the youth .
` Come down and take all you want .
There wo n't be much left after this . '
So the griffin alighted and ate his fill , saying , as he flew away , ` Call me if you need me . '
` What a hurry he was in ! '
the youth said to himself .
` He might have been able to direct me to the church , for I shall never find it alone . '
He gathered up his things , and started to walk a little farther before resting .
He had not gone far when all of a sudden he saw the church !
He soon came to it , or rather to the wide and deep moat which surrounded it without a single bridge by which to cross .
It was too late to attempt anything now ; and , besides , the poor youth was very tired , so he lay down on the ground and fell fast asleep .
Next morning , when he awoke , he began to wish himself over the moat ; and the thought occurred to him that if only the red ox were there , and thirsty enough to drink up all the water in the moat , he might walk across it dry shod .
Scarcely had the thought crossed his brain before the ox appeared and began to drink up the water .
The grateful youth hastened across as soon as the moat was dry , but found it impossible to penetrate the thick walls and strong iron doors of the church . '
I believe that big boar would be of more use here than I am , ' he thought , and lo !
at the wish the wild boar came and began to push hard against the wall .
He managed to loosen one stone with his tusks , and , having made a beginning , stone after stone was poked out till he had made quite a large hole , big enough to let a man go through .
The young man quickly entered the church , and saw a bird flying about , but he could not catch it .
` Oh ! '
he exclaimed , ` if only the griffin were here , he would soon catch it . '
At these words the griffin appeared , and , seizing the bird , gave it to the youth , who carried it off carefully , while the griffin flew away .
The young man hurried home as fast as possible , and reached the cottage before evening .
He told his story to the little bride , who , after giving him some food and drink , hid him with his bird beneath the bed .
Presently the old man came home , and complained of feeling ill .
Nothing , he said , would go well with him any more : his ` heart bird ' was caught .
The youth under the bed heard this , and thought , ` This old fellow has done me no particular harm , but then he has bewitched my brothers and their brides , and has kept my bride for himself , and that is certainly bad enough . '
So he pinched the bird , and the old man cried , ` Ah !
I feel death gripping me !
Child , I am dying ! '
With these words he fell fainting from his chair , and as the youth , before he knew what he was doing , had squeezed the bird to death , the old man died also .
Out crept the young man from under the bed , and the girl took the magic wand -LRB- which she found where the old man had told her -RRB- , and , touching the twelve grey stones , transformed them at once into the six brothers and their brides .
Then there was great joy , and kissing and embracing .
And there lay the old man , quite dead , and no magic wand could restore him to life , even had they wished it .
After that they all went away and were married , and lived many years happily together .
The Two Brothers Sicilianische Malirchen .
L. Gonzenbach .
Long ago there lived two brothers , both of them very handsome , and both so very poor that they seldom had anything to eat but the fish which they caught .
One day they had been out in their boat since sunrise without a single bite , and were just thinking of putting up their lines and going home to bed when they felt a little feeble tug , and , drawing in hastily , they found a tiny fish at the end of the hook .
` What a wretched little creature ! '
cried one brother .
` However , it is better than nothing , and I will bake him with bread crumbs and have him for supper . '
` Oh , do not kill me yet ! '
begged the fish ; ' I will bring you good luck -- indeed I will ! '
` You silly thing ! '
said the young man ; ` I 've caught you , and I shall eat you . '
But his brother was sorry for the fish , and put in a word for him .
` Let the poor little fellow live .
He would hardly make one bite , and , after all , how do we know we are not throwing away our luck !
Put him back into the sea .
It will be much better . '
` If you will let me live , ' said the fish , ` you will find on the sands to-morrow morning two beautiful horses splendidly saddled and bridled , and on them you can go through the world as knights seeking adventures . '
` Oh dear , what nonsense ! '
exclaimed the elder ; ` and , besides , what proof have we that you are speaking the truth ? '
But again the younger brother interposed : ` Oh , do let him live !
You know if he is lying to us we can always catch him again .
It is quite worth while trying . '
At last the young man gave in , and threw the fish back into the sea ; and both brothers went supperless to bed , and wondered what fortune the next day would bring .
At the first streaks of dawn they were both up , and in a very few minutes were running down to the shore .
And there , just as the fish had said , stood two magnificent horses , saddled and bridled , and on their backs lay suits of armour and under-dresses , two swords , and two purses of gold .
` There ! '
said the younger brother .
` Are you not thankful you did not eat that fish ?
He has brought us good luck , and there is no knowing how great we may become !
Now , we will each seek our own adventures .
If you will take one road I will go the other . '
` Very well , ' replied the elder ; ` but how shall we let each other know if we are both living ? '
` Do you see this fig-tree ? '
said the younger .
` Well , whenever we want news of each other we have only to come here and make a slit with our swords in the back .
If milk flows , it is a sign that we are well and prosperous ; but if , instead of milk , there is blood , then we are either dead or in great danger . '
Then the two brothers put on their armour , buckled their swords , and pocketed their purees ; and , after taking a tender farewell of each other , they mounted their horses and went their various ways .
The elder brother rode straight on till he reached the borders of a strange kingdom .
He crossed the frontier , and soon found himself on the banks of a river ; and before him , in the middle of the stream , a beautiful girl sat chained to a rock and weeping bitterly .
For in this river dwelt a serpent with seven heads , who threatened to lay waste the whole land by breathing fire and flame from his nostrils unless the king sent him every morning a man for his breakfast .
This had gone on so long that now there were no men left , and he had been obliged to send his own daughter instead , and the poor girl was waiting till the monster got hungry and felt inclined to eat her .
When the young man saw the maiden weeping bitterly he said to her , ` What is the matter , my poor girl ? '
` Oh ! '
she answered , ' I am chained here till a horrible serpent with seven heads comes to eat me .
Oh , sir , do not linger here , or he will eat you too . ' '
I shall stay , ' replied the young man , ` for I mean to set you free . '
` That is impossible .
You do not know what a fearful monster the serpent is ; you can do nothing against him . '
` That is my affair , beautiful captive , ' answered he ; ` only tell me , which way will the serpent come ? '
` Well , if you are resolved to free me , listen to my advice .
Stand a little on one side , and then , when the serpent rises to the surface , I will say to him , `` O serpent , to-day you can eat two people .
But you had better begin first with the young man , for I am chained and can not run away . ''
When he hears this most likely he will attack you . '
So the young man stood carefully on one side , and by-and-bye he heard a great rushing in the water ; and a horrible monster came up to the surface and looked out for the rock where the king 's daughter was chained , for it was getting late and he was hungry .
But she cried out , ' O serpent , to-day you can eat two people .
And you had better begin with the young man , for I am chained and can not run away . '
Then the serpent made a rush at the youth with wide open jaws to swallow him at one gulp , but the young man leaped aside and drew his sword , and fought till he had cut off all the seven heads .
And when the great serpent lay dead at his feet he loosed the bonds of the king 's daughter , and she flung herself into his arms and said , ` You have saved me from that monster , and now you shall be my husband , for my father has made a proclamation that whoever could slay the serpent should have his daughter to wife . '
But he answered , ' I can not become your husband yet , for I have still far to travel .
But wait for me seven years and seven months .
Then , if I do not return , you are free to marry whom you will .
And in case you should have forgotten , I will take these seven tongues with me so that when I bring them forth you may know that I am really he who slew the serpent . '
So saying he cut out the seven tongues , and the princess gave him a thick cloth to wrap them in ; and he mounted his horse and rode away .
Not long after he had gone there arrived at the river a slave who had been sent by the king to learn the fate of his beloved daughter .
And when the slave saw the princess standing free and safe before him , with the body of the monster lying at her feet , a wicked plan came into his head , and he said , ` Unless you promise to tell your father it was I who slew the serpent , I will kill you and bury you in this place , and no one will ever know what befell . '
What could the poor girl do ?
This time there was no knight to come to her aid .
So she promised to do as the slave wished , and he took up the seven heads and brought the princess to her father .
Oh , how enchanted the king was to see her again , and the whole town shared his joy !
And the slave was called upon to tell how he had slain the monster , and when he had ended the king declared that he should have the princess to wife .
But she flung herself at her father 's feet , and prayed him to delay .
` You have passed your royal word , and can not go back from it Yet grant me this grace , and let seven years and seven months go by before you wed me .
When they are over , then I will marry the slave . '
And the king listened to her , and seven years and seven months she looked for her bridegroom , and wept for him night and day .
All this time the young man was riding through the world , and when the seven years and seven months were over he came back to the town where the princess lived -- only a few days before the wedding .
And he stood before the king , and said to him : ` Give me your daughter , O king , for I slew the seven-headed serpent .
And as a sign that my words are true , look on these seven tongues , which I cut from his seven heads , and on this embroidered cloth , which was given me by your daughter . '
Then the princess lifted up her voice and said , ` Yes , dear father , he has spoken the truth , and it is he who is my real bridegroom .
Yet pardon the slave , for he was sorely tempted . '
But the king answered , ` Such treachery can no man pardon .
Quick , away with him , and off with his head ! '
So the false slave was put to death , that none might follow in his footsteps , and the wedding feast was held , and the hearts of all rejoiced that the true bridegroom had come at last .
These two lived happy and contentedly for a long while , when one evening , as the young man was looking from the window , he saw on a mountain that lay out beyond the town a great bright light .
` What can it be ? '
he said to his wife .
` Ah !
do not look at it , ' she answered , ` for it comes from the house of a wicked witch whom no man can manage to kill . '
But the princess had better have kept silence , for her words made her husband 's heart burn within him , and he longed to try his strength against the witch 's cunning .
And all day long the feeling grew stronger , till the next morning he mounted his horse , and in spite of his wife 's tears , he rode off to the mountain .
The distance was greater than he thought , and it was dark before he reached the foot of the mountain ; indeed , he could not have found the road at all had it not been for the bright light , which shone like the moon on his path .
At length he came to the door of a fine castle , which had a blaze streaming from every window .
He mounted a flight of steps and entered a hall where a hideous old woman was sitting on a golden chair .
She scowled at the young man and said , ` With a single one of the hairs of my head I can turn you into stone . '
` Oh , what nonsense ! '
cried he .
` Be quiet , old woman .
What could you do with one hair ? '
But the witch pulled out a hair and laid it on his shoulder , and his limbs grew cold and heavy , and he could not stir .
Now at this very moment the younger brother was thinking of him , and wondering how he had got on during all the years since they had parted . '
I will go to the fig-tree , ' he said to himself , ` to see whether he is alive or dead . '
So he rode through the forest till he came where the fig-tree stood , and cut a slit in the bark , and waited .
In a moment a little gurgling noise was heard , and out came a stream of blood , running fast .
` Ah , woe is me ! '
he cried bitterly .
` My brother is dead or dying !
Shall I ever reach him in time to save his life ? '
Then , leaping on his horse , he shouted , ` Now , my steed , fly like the wind ! '
and they rode right through the world , till one day they came to the town where the young man and his wife lived .
Here the princess had been sitting every day since the morning that her husband had left her , weeping bitter tears , and listening for his footsteps .
And when she saw his brother ride under the balcony she mistook him for her own husband , for they were so alike that no man might tell the difference , and her heart bounded , and , leaning down , she called to him , ` At last !
