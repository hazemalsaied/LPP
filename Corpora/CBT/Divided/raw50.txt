Thou wilt surely return ? '
The old man caught at his wrist .
` And thou wilt return in this very same shape ?
Is it too late to look tonight for the River ? '
` Too late and too dark .
Be comforted .
Think how far thou art on the road -- an hundred miles from Lahore already . '
` Yea -- and farther from my monastery .
Alas !
It is a great and terrible world . '
Kim stole out and away , as unremarkable a figure as ever carried his own and a few score thousand other folk 's fate slung round his neck .
Mahbub Ali 's directions left him little doubt of the house in which his Englishman lived ; and a groom , bringing a dog-cart home from the Club , made him quite sure .
It remained only to identify his man , and Kim slipped through the garden hedge and hid in a clump of plumed grass close to the veranda .
The house blazed with lights , and servants moved about tables dressed with flowers , glass , and silver .
Presently forth came an Englishman , dressed in black and white , humming a tune .
It was too dark to see his face , so Kim , beggar-wise , tried an old experiment .
` Protector of the Poor ! '
The man backed towards the voice .
` Mahbub Ali says -- ' ` Hah !
What says Mahbub Ali ? '
He made no attempt to look for the speaker , and that showed Kim that he knew .
` The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established . '
` What proof is there ? '
The Englishman switched at the rose-hedge in the side of the drive .
` Mahbub Ali has given me this proof . '
Kim flipped the wad of folded paper into the air , and it fell in the path beside the man , who put his foot on it as a gardener came round the corner .
When the servant passed he picked it up , dropped a rupee -- Kim could hear the clink -- and strode into the house , never turning round .
Swiftly Kim took up the money ; but for all his training , he was Irish enough by birth to reckon silver the least part of any game .
What he desired was the visible effect of action ; so , instead of slinking away , he lay close in the grass and wormed nearer to the house .
He saw -- Indian bungalows are open through and through -- the Englishman return to a small dressing-room , in a comer of the veranda , that was half office , littered with papers and despatch-boxes , and sit down to study Mahbub Ali 's message .
His face , by the full ray of the kerosene lamp , changed and darkened , and Kim , used as every beggar must be to watching countenances , took good note .
` Will !
Will , dear ! '
called a woman 's voice .
` You ought to be in the drawing-room .
They 'll be here in a minute . '
The man still read intently .
` Will ! '
said the voice , five minutes later .
` He 's come .
I can hear the troopers in the drive . '
The man dashed out bareheaded as a big landau with four native troopers behind it halted at the veranda , and a tall , black haired man , erect as an arrow , swung out , preceded by a young officer who laughed pleasantly .
Flat on his belly lay Kim , almost touching the high wheels .
His man and the black stranger exchanged two sentences .
` Certainly , sir , ' said the young officer promptly .
` Everything waits while a horse is concerned . '
` We sha n't be more than twenty minutes , ' said Kim 's man .
` You can do the honours -- keep 'em amused , and all that . '
` Tell one of the troopers to wait , ' said the tall man , and they both passed into the dressing-room together as the landau rolled away .
Kim saw their heads bent over Mahbub Ali 's message , and heard the voices -- one low and deferential , the other sharp and decisive .
` It is n't a question of weeks .
It is a question of days -- hours almost , ' said the elder .
` I 'd been expecting it for some time , but this ' -- he tapped Mahbub Ali 's paper -- ` clinches it .
Grogan 's dining here to-night , is n't he ? '
` Yes , sir , and Macklin too . '
` Very good .
I 'll speak to them myself .
The matter will be referred to the Council , of course , but this is a case where one is justified in assuming that we take action at once .
Warn the Pined and Peshawar brigades .
It will disorganize all the summer reliefs , but we ca n't help that .
This comes of not smashing them thoroughly the first time .
Eight thousand should be enough . '
` What about artillery , sir ? ' '
I must consult Macklin . '
` Then it means war ? '
` No .
Punishment .
When a man is bound by the action of his predecessor -- ' ` But C25 may have lied . '
` He bears out the other 's information .
Practically , they showed their hand six months back .
But Devenish would have it there was a chance of peace .
Of course they used it to make themselves stronger .
Send off those telegrams at once -- the new code , not the old -- mine and Wharton 's .
I do n't think we need keep the ladies waiting any longer .
We can settle the rest over the cigars .
I thought it was coming .
It 's punishment -- not war . '
As the trooper cantered off , Kim crawled round to the back of the house , where , going on his Lahore experiences , he judged there would be food -- and information .
The kitchen was crowded with excited scullions , one of whom kicked him .
` Aie , ' said Kim , feigning tears . '
I came only to wash dishes in return for a bellyful . '
` All Umballa is on the same errand .
Get hence .
They go in now with the soup .
Think you that we who serve Creighton Sahib need strange scullions to help us through a big dinner ? '
` It is a very big dinner , ' said Kim , looking at the plates .
` Small wonder .
The guest of honour is none other than the Jang-i-Lat Sahib -LSB- the Commander-in-Chief -RSB- . '
` Ho ! '
said Kim , with the correct guttural note of wonder .
He had learned what he wanted , and when the scullion turned he was gone .
` And all that trouble , ' said he to himself , thinking as usual in Hindustani , ` for a horse 's pedigree !
Mahbub Ali should have come to me to learn a little lying .
Every time before that I have borne a message it concerned a woman .
Now it is men .
Better .
The tall man said that they will loose a great army to punish someone -- somewhere -- the news goes to Pindi and Peshawur .
There are also guns .
Would I had crept nearer .
It is big news ! '
He returned to find the cultivator 's cousin 's younger brother discussing the family law-suit in all its bearings with the cultivator and his wife and a few friends , while the lama dozed .
After the evening meal some one passed him a water-pipe ; and Kim felt very much of a man as he pulled at the smooth coconut-shell , his legs spread abroad in the moonlight , his tongue clicking in remarks from time to time .
His hosts were most polite ; for the cultivator 's wife had told them of his vision of the Red Bull , and of his probable descent from another world .
Moreover , the lama was a great and venerable curiosity .
The family priest , an old , tolerant Sarsut Brahmin , dropped in later , and naturally started a theological argument to impress the family .
By creed , of course , they were all on their priest 's side , but the lama was the guest and the novelty .
His gentle kindliness , and his impressive Chinese quotations , that sounded like spells , delighted them hugely ; and in this sympathetic , simple air , he expanded like the Bodhisat 's own lotus , speaking of his life in the great hills of Such-zen , before , as he said , ' I rose up to seek enlightenment . '
Then it came out that in those worldly days he had been a master-hand at casting horoscopes and nativities ; and the family priest led him on to describe his methods ; each giving the planets names that the other could not understand , and pointing upwards as the big stars sailed across the dark .
The children of the house tugged unrebuked at his rosary ; and he clean forgot the Rule which forbids looking at women as he talked of enduring snows , landslips , blocked passes , the remote cliffs where men find sapphires and turquoise , and that wonderful upland road that leads at last into Great China itself .
` How thinkest thou of this one ? '
said the cultivator aside to the priest . '
A holy man -- a holy man indeed .
His Gods are not the Gods , but his feet are upon the Way , ' was the answer .
` And his methods of nativities , though that is beyond thee , are wise and sure . '
` Tell me , ' said Kim lazily , ` whether I find my Red Bull on a green field , as was promised me . '
` What knowledge hast thou of thy birth-hour ? '
the priest asked , swelling with importance .
` Between first and second cockcrow of the first night in May . '
` Of what year ? ' '
I do not know ; but upon the hour that I cried first fell the great earthquake in Srinagar which is in Kashmir . '
This Kim had from the woman who took care of him , and she again from Kimball O'Hara .
The earthquake had been felt in India , and for long stood a leading date in the Punjab .
` Ai ! '
said a woman excitedly .
This seemed to make Kim 's supernatural origin more certain .
` Was not such an one 's daughter born then -- ' ` And her mother bore her husband four sons in four years all likely boys , ' cried the cultivator 's wife , sitting outside the circle in the shadow .
` None reared in the knowledge , ' said the family priest , ` forget how the planets stood in their Houses upon that night . '
He began to draw in the dust of the courtyard .
` At least thou hast good claim to a half of the House of the Bull .
How runs thy prophecy ? '
` Upon a day , ' said Kim , delighted at the sensation he was creating , ' I shall be made great by means of a Red Bull on a green field , but first there will enter two men making all things ready . '
` Yes : thus ever at the opening of a vision .
A thick darkness that clears slowly ; anon one enters with a broom making ready the place .
Then begins the Sight .
Two men -- thou sayest ?
Ay , ay .
The Sun , leaving the House of the Bull , enters that of the Twins .
Hence the two men of the prophecy .
Let us now consider .
Fetch me a twig , little one . '
He knitted his brows , scratched , smoothed out , and scratched again in the dust mysterious signs -- to the wonder of all save the lama , who , with fine instinct , forbore to interfere .
At the end of half an hour , he tossed the twig from him with a grunt .
` Hm !
Thus say the stars .
Within three days come the two men to make all things ready .
After them follows the Bull ; but the sign over against him is the sign of War and armed men . '
` There was indeed a man of the Ludhiana Sikhs in the carriage from Lahore , ' said the cultivator 's wife hopefully .
` Tck !
Armed men -- many hundreds .
What concern hast thou with war ? '
said the priest to Kim .
` Thine is a red and an angry sign of War to be loosed very soon . '
` None -- none . '
said the lama earnestly .
` We seek only peace and our River . '
Kim smiled , remembering what he had overheard in the dressing-room .
Decidedly he was a favourite of the stars .
The priest brushed his foot over the rude horoscope .
` More than this I can not see .
In three days comes the Bull to thee , boy . '
` And my River , my River , ' pleaded the lama . '
I had hoped his Bull would lead us both to the River . '
` Alas , for that wondrous River , my brother , ' the priest replied .
` Such things are not common . '
Next morning , though they were pressed to stay , the lama insisted on departure .
They gave Kim a large bundle of good food and nearly three annas in copper money for the needs of the road , and with many blessings watched the two go southward in the dawn .
` Pity it is that these and such as these could not be freed from -- ' ` Nay , then would only evil people be left on the earth , and who would give us meat and shelter ? '
quoth Kim , stepping merrily under his burden .
` Yonder is a small stream .
Let us look , ' said the lama , and he led from the white road across the fields ; walking into a very hornets ' nest of pariah dogs .
Chapter 3 Yea , voice of every Soul that clung To life that strove from rung to rung When Devadatta 's rule was young , The warm wind brings Kamakura .
Buddha at Kamakura .
Behind them an angry farmer brandished a bamboo pole .
He was a market-gardener , Arain by caste , growing vegetables and flowers for Umballa city , and well Kim knew the breed .
` Such an one , ' said the lama , disregarding the dogs , ` is impolite to strangers , intemperate of speech and uncharitable .
Be warned by his demeanour , my disciple . '
` Ho , shameless beggars ! '
shouted the farmer .
` Begone !
Get hence ! '
` We go , ' the lama returned , with quiet dignity .
` We go from these unblessed fields . '
` Ah , ' said Kim , sucking in his breath .
` If the next crops fail , thou canst only blame thine own tongue . '
The man shuffled uneasily in his slippers .
` The land is full of beggars , ' he began , half apologetically .
` And by what sign didst thou know that we would beg from thee , O Mali ? '
said Kim tartly , using the name that a market-gardener least likes .
` All we sought was to look at that river beyond the field there . '
` River , forsooth ! '
the man snorted .
` What city do ye hail from not to know a canal-cut ?
It runs as straight as an arrow , and I pay for the water as though it were molten silver .
There is a branch of a river beyond .
But if ye need water I can give that -- and milk . '
` Nay , we will go to the river , ' said the lama , striding out .
` Milk and a meal . '
the man stammered , as he looked at the strange tall figure .
` I -- I would not draw evil upon myself -- or my crops .
But beggars are so many in these hard days . '
` Take notice . '
The lama turned to Kim .
` He was led to speak harshly by the Red Mist of anger .
That clearing from his eyes , he becomes courteous and of an affable heart .
May his fields be blessed !
Beware not to judge men too hastily , O farmer . ' '
I have met holy ones who would have cursed thee from hearthstone to byre , ' said Kim to the abashed man .
` Is he not wise and holy ?
I am his disciple . '
He cocked his nose in the air loftily and stepped across the narrow field-borders with great dignity .
` There is no pride , ' said the lama , after a pause , ` there is no pride among such as follow the Middle Way . '
` But thou hast said he was low-caste and discourteous . '
` Low-caste I did not say , for how can that be which is not ?
Afterwards he amended his discourtesy , and I forgot the offence .
Moreover , he is as we are , bound upon the Wheel of Things ; but he does not tread the way of deliverance . '
He halted at a little runlet among the fields , and considered the hoof-pitted bank .
` Now , how wilt thou know thy River ? '
said Kim , squatting in the shade of some tall sugar-cane .
` When I find it , an enlightenment will surely be given .
This , I feel , is not the place .
O littlest among the waters , if only thou couldst tell me where runs my River !
But be thou blessed to make the fields bear ! '
` Look !
Look ! '
Kim sprang to his side and dragged him back .
A yellow-and-brown streak glided from the purple rustling stems to the bank , stretched its neck to the water , drank , and lay still -- a big cobra with fixed , lidless eyes . '
I have no stick -- I have no stick , ' said Kim . '
I will get me one and break his back . '
` Why ?
He is upon the Wheel as we are -- a life ascending or descending -- very far from deliverance .
Great evil must the soul have done that is cast into this shape . ' '
I hate all snakes , ' said Kim .
No native training can quench the white man 's horror of the Serpent .
` Let him live out his life . '
The coiled thing hissed and half opened its hood .
` May thy release come soon , brother ! '
the lama continued placidly .
` Hast thou knowledge , by chance , of my River ? '
` Never have I seen such a man as thou art , ' Kim whispered , overwhelmed .
` Do the very snakes understand thy talk ? '
` Who knows ? '
He passed within a foot of the cobra 's poised head .
It flattened itself among the dusty coils .
` Come , thou ! '
he called over his shoulder .
` Not I , ' said Kim ' . '
I go round . '
` Come .
He does no hurt . '
Kim hesitated for a moment .
The lama backed his order by some droned Chinese quotation which Kim took for a charm .
He obeyed and bounded across the rivulet , and the snake , indeed , made no sign .
` Never have I seen such a man . '
Kim wiped the sweat from his forehead .
` And now , whither go we ? '
` That is for thee to say .
I am old , and a stranger -- far from my own place .
But that the rail-carriage fills my head with noises of devil-drums I would go in it to Benares now ... Yet by so going we may miss the River .
Let us find another river . '
Where the hard-worked soil gives three and even four crops a year through patches of sugar-cane , tobacco , long white radishes , and nol-kol , all that day they strolled on , turning aside to every glimpse of water ; rousing village dogs and sleeping villages at noonday ; the lama replying to the volleyed questions with an unswerving simplicity .
They sought a River : a River of miraculous healing .
Had any one knowledge of such a stream ?
Sometimes men laughed , but more often heard the story out to the end and offered them a place in the shade , a drink of milk , and a meal .
The women were always kind , and the little children as children are the world over , alternately shy and venturesome .
Evening found them at rest under the village tree of a mud-walled , mud-roofed hamlet , talking to the headman as the cattle came in from the grazing-grounds and the women prepared the day 's last meal .
They had passed beyond the belt of market-gardens round hungry Umballa , and were among the mile-wide green of the staple crops .
He was a white-bearded and affable elder , used to entertaining strangers .
He dragged out a string bedstead for the lama , set warm cooked food before him , prepared him a pipe , and , the evening ceremonies being finished in the village temple , sent for the village priest .
Kim told the older children tales of the size and beauty of Lahore , of railway travel , and such-like city things , while the men talked , slowly as their cattle chew the cud . '
I can not fathom it , ' said the headman at last to the priest .
` How readest thou this talk ? '
The lama , his tale told , was silently telling his beads .
` He is a Seeker . '
the priest answered .
` The land is full of such .
Remember him who came only last , month -- the fakir with the tortoise ? '
` Ay , but that man had right and reason , for Krishna Himself appeared in a vision promising him Paradise without the burning-pyre if he journeyed to Prayag .
This man seeks no God who is within my knowledge . '
` Peace , he is old : he comes from far off , and he is mad , ' the smooth-shaven priest replied .
` Hear me . '
He turned to the lama .
` Three koss -LSB- six miles -RSB- to the westward runs the great road to Calcutta . '
` But I would go to Benares -- to Benares . '
` And to Benares also .
It crosses all streams on this side of Hind .
Now my word to thee , Holy One , is rest here till tomorrow .
Then take the road ' -LRB- it was the Grand Trunk Road he meant -RRB- ` and test each stream that it overpasses ; for , as I understand , the virtue of thy River lies neither in one pool nor place , but throughout its length .
Then , if thy Gods will , be assured that thou wilt come upon thy freedom . '
` That is well said . '
The lama was much impressed by the plan .
` We will begin tomorrow , and a blessing on thee for showing old feet such a near road . '
A deep , sing-song Chinese half-chant closed the sentence .
Even the priest was impressed , and the headman feared an evil spell : but none could look at the lama 's simple , eager face and doubt him long .
` Seest thou my chela ? '
he said , diving into his snuff-gourd with an important sniff .
It was his duty to repay courtesy with courtesy . '
I see -- and hear . '
The headman rolled his eye where Kim was chatting to a girl in blue as she laid crackling thorns on a fire .
` He also has a Search of his own .
No river , but a Bull .
Yea , a Red Bull on a green field will some day raise him to honour .
He is , I think , not altogether of this world .
He was sent of a sudden to aid me in this search , and his name is Friend of all the World . '
The priest smiled .
` Ho , there , Friend of all the World , ' he cried across the sharp-smelling smoke , ` what art thou ? '
` This Holy One 's disciple , ' said Kim .
` He says thou are a but -LSB- a spirit -RSB- . '
` Can buts eat ? '
said Kim , with a twinkle .
` For I am hungry . '
` It is no jest , ' cried the lama . '
A certain astrologer of that city whose name I have forgotten -- ' ` That is no more than the city of Umballa where we slept last night , ' Kim whispered to the priest .
` Ay , Umballa was it ?
He cast a horoscope and declared that my chela should find his desire within two days .
But what said he of the meaning of the stars , Friend of all the World ? '
Kim cleared his throat and looked around at the village greybeards .
` The meaning of my Star is War , ' he replied pompously .
Somebody laughed at the little tattered figure strutting on the brickwork plinth under the great tree .
Where a native would have lain down , Kim 's white blood set him upon his feet .
` Ay , War , ' he answered .
` That is a sure prophecy , ' rumbled a deep voice .
` For there is always war along the Border -- as I know . '
It was an old , withered man , who had served the Government in the days of the Mutiny as a native officer in a newly raised cavalry regiment .
The Government had given him a good holding in the village , and though the demands of his sons , now grey-bearded officers on their own account , had impoverished him , he was still a person of consequence .
English officials -- Deputy Commissioners even -- turned aside from the main road to visit him , and on those occasions he dressed himself in the uniform of ancient days , and stood up like a ramrod .
` But this shall be a great war -- a war of eight thousand . '
Kim 's voice shrilled across the quick-gathering crowd , astonishing himself .
` Redcoats or our own regiments ? '
the old man snapped , as though he were asking an equal .
His tone made men respect Kim .
` Redcoats , ' said Kim at a venture .
` Redcoats and guns . '
` But -- but the astrologer said no word of this , ' cried the lama , snuffing prodigiously in his excitement .
` But I know .
The word has come to me , who am this Holy One 's disciple .
There will rise a war -- a war of eight thousand redcoats .
From Pindi and Peshawur they will be drawn .
This is sure . '
` The boy has heard bazar-talk , ' said the priest .
` But he was always by my side , ' said the lama .
` How should he know ?
I did not know . '
` He will make a clever juggler when the old man is dead , ' muttered the priest to the headman .
` What new trick is this ? ' '
A sign .
Give me a sign , ' thundered the old soldier suddenly .
` If there were war my sons would have told me . '
` When all is ready , thy sons , doubt not , will be told .
But it is a long road from thy sons to the man in whose hands these things lie . '
Kim warmed to the game , for it reminded him of experiences in the letter-carrying line , when , for the sake of a few pice , he pretended to know more than he knew .
But now he was playing for larger things -- the sheer excitement and the sense of power .
He drew a new breath and went on .
` Old man , give me a sign .
Do underlings order the goings of eight thousand redcoats -- with guns ? '
` No . '
Still the old man answered as though Kim were an equal .
` Dost thou know who He is , then , that gives the order ? ' '
I have seen Him . '
` To know again ? ' '
I have known Him since he was a lieutenant in the topkhana -LRB- the Artillery -RRB- . ' '
A tall man .
A tall man with black hair , walking thus ? '
Kim took a few paces in a stiff , wooden style .
` Ay .
But that anyone may have seen . '
The crowd were breathless -- still through all this talk .
` That is true , ' said Kim .
` But I will say more .
Look now .
First the great man walks thus .
Then He thinks thus . '
-LRB- Kim drew a forefinger over his forehead and downwards till it came to rest by the angle of the jaw . -RRB-
` Anon He twitches his fingers thus .
Anon He thrusts his hat under his left armpit . '
Kim illustrated the motion and stood like a stork .
The old man groaned , inarticulate with amazement ; and the crowd shivered .
` So -- so -- so .
But what does He when He is about to give an order ? '
` He rubs the skin at the back of his neck -- thus .
Then falls one finger on the table and He makes a small sniffing noise through his nose .
Then He speaks , saying : `` Loose such and such a regiment .
Call out such guns . '' '
The old man rose stiffly and saluted . '
`` For '' ' -- Kim translated into the vernacular the clinching sentences he had heard in the dressing-room at Umballa -- ' `` For , '' says He , `` we should have done this long ago .
It is not war -- it is a chastisement .
Snff ! '' '
` Enough .
I believe .
I have seen Him thus in the smoke of battles .
Seen and heard .
It is He ! ' '
I saw no smoke ' -- Kim 's voice shifted to the rapt sing-song of the wayside fortune-teller . '
I saw this in darkness .
First came a man to make things clear .
Then came horsemen .
Then came He standing in a ring of light .
The rest followed as I have said .
Old man , have I spoken truth ? '
` It is He .
Past all doubt it is He . '
The crowd drew a long , quavering breath , staring alternately at the old man , still at attention , and ragged Kim against the purple twilight .
` Said I not -- said I not he was from the other world ? '
cried the lama proudly .
` He is the Friend of all the World .
He is the Friend of the Stars ! '
` At least it does not concern us , ' a man cried . '
O thou young soothsayer , if the gift abides with thee at all seasons , I have a red-spotted cow .
She may be sister to thy Bull for aught I know -- ' ` Or I care , ' said Kim .
` My Stars do not concern themselves with thy cattle . '
` Nay , but she is very sick , ' a woman struck in .
` My man is a buffalo , or he would have chosen his words better .
Tell me if she recover ? '
Had Kim been at all an ordinary boy , he would have carried on the play ; but one does not know Lahore city , and least of all the fakirs by the Taksali Gate , for thirteen years without also knowing human nature .
The priest looked at him sideways , something bitterly -- a dry and blighting smile .
` Is there no priest , then , in the village ?
I thought I had seen a great one even now , ' cried Kim .
` Ay -- but -- ' the woman began .
` But thou and thy husband hoped to get the cow cured for a handful of thanks . '
The shot told : they were notoriously the closest-fisted couple in the village .
` It is not well to cheat the temples .
Give a young calf to thine own priest , and , unless thy Gods are angry past recall , she will give milk within a month . ' '
A master-beggar art thou , ' purred the priest approvingly .
` Not the cunning of forty years could have done better .
Surely thou hast made the old man rich ? ' '
A little flour , a little butter and a mouthful of cardamoms , ' Kim retorted , flushed with the praise , but still cautious -- ` Does one grow rich on that ?
And , as thou canst see , he is mad .
But it serves me while I learn the road at least . '
He knew what the fakirs of the Taksali Gate were like when they talked among themselves , and copied the very inflection of their lewd disciples .
` Is his Search , then , truth or a cloak to other ends ?
It may be treasure . '
` He is mad -- many times mad .
There is nothing else . '
Here the old soldier bobbled up and asked if Kim would accept his hospitality for the night .
The priest recommended him to do so , but insisted that the honour of entertaining the lama belonged to the temple -- at which the lama smiled guilelessly .
Kim glanced from one face to the other , and drew his own conclusions .
` Where is the money ? '
he whispered , beckoning the old man off into the darkness .
` In my bosom .
Where else ? '
` Give it me .
Quietly and swiftly give it me . '
` But why ?
Here is no ticket to buy . '
` Am I thy chela , or am I not ?
Do I not safeguard thy old feet about the ways ?
Give me the money and at dawn I will return it . '
He slipped his hand above the lama 's girdle and brought away the purse .
` Be it so -- be it so . '
The old man nodded his head .
` This is a great and terrible world .
I never knew there were so many men alive in it . '
Next morning the priest was in a very bad temper , but the lama was quite happy ; and Kim had enjoyed a most interesting evening with the old man , who brought out his cavalry sabre and , balancing it on his dry knees , told tales of the Mutiny and young captains thirty years in their graves , till Kim dropped off to sleep .
` Certainly the air of this country is good , ' said the lama . '
I sleep lightly , as do all old men ; but last night I slept unwaking till broad day .
Even now I am heavy . '
` Drink a draught of hot milk , ' said Kim , who had carried not a few such remedies to opium-smokers of his acquaintance .
` It is time to take the Road again . '
` The long Road that overpasses all the rivers of Hind , ' said the lama gaily .
` Let us go .
But how thinkest thou , chela , to recompense these people , and especially the priest , for their great kindness ?
Truly they are but parast , but in other lives , maybe , they will receive enlightenment .
A rupee to the temple ?
The thing within is no more than stone and red paint , but the heart of man we must acknowledge when and where it is good . '
` Holy One , hast thou ever taken the Road alone ? '
Kim looked up sharply , like the Indian crows so busy about the fields .
` Surely , child : from Kulu to Pathankot -- from Kulu , where my first chela died .
When men were kind to us we made offerings , and all men were well-disposed throughout all the Hills . '
` It is otherwise in Hind , ' said Kim drily .
` Their Gods are many-armed and malignant .
Let them alone . ' '
I would set thee on thy road for a little , Friend of all the World , thou and thy yellow man . '
The old soldier ambled up the village street , all shadowy in the dawn , on a punt , scissor-hocked pony .
` Last night broke up the fountains of remembrance in my so-dried heart , and it was as a blessing to me .
Truly there is war abroad in the air .
I smell it .
See !
I have brought my sword . '
He sat long-legged on the little beast , with the big sword at his side -- hand dropped on the pommel -- staring fiercely over the flat lands towards the North .
` Tell me again how He showed in thy vision .
Come up and sit behind me .
The beast will carry two . ' '
I am this Holy One 's disciple , ' said Kim , as they cleared the village-gate .
The villagers seemed almost sorry to be rid of them , but the priest 's farewell was cold and distant .
He had wasted some opium on a man who carried no money .
` That is well spoken .
I am not much used to holy men , but respect is always good .
There is no respect in these days -- not even when a Commissioner Sahib comes to see me .
But why should one whose Star leads him to war follow a holy man ? '
` But he is a holy man , ' said Kim earnestly .
` In truth , and in talk and in act , holy .
He is not like the others .
I have never seen such an one .
We be not fortune-tellers , or jugglers , or beggars . '
` Thou art not .
That I can see .
But I do not know that other .
He marches well , though . '
The first freshness of the day carried the lama forward with long , easy , camel-like strides .
He was deep in meditation , mechanically clicking his rosary .
They followed the rutted and worn country road that wound across the flat between the great dark-green mango-groves , the line of the snowcapped Himalayas faint to the eastward .
All India was at work in the fields , to the creaking of well-wheels , the shouting of ploughmen behind their cattle , and the clamour of the crows .
Even the pony felt the good influence and almost broke into a trot as Kim laid a hand on the stirrup-leather .
` It repents me that I did not give a rupee to the shrine , ' said the lama on the last bead of his eighty-one .
The old soldier growled in his beard , so that the lama for the first time was aware of him .
` Seekest thou the River also ? '
said he , turning .
` The day is new , ' was the reply .
` What need of a river save to water at before sundown ?
I come to show thee a short lane to the Big Road . '
` That is a courtesy to be remembered , O man of good will .
But why the sword ? '
The old soldier looked as abashed as a child interrupted in his game of make-believe .
` The sword , ' he said , fumbling it .
` Oh , that was a fancy of mine an old man 's fancy .
Truly the police orders are that no man must bear weapons throughout Hind , but ' -- he cheered up and slapped the hilt -- ` all the constabeels hereabout know me . '
` It is not a good fancy , ' said the lama .
` What profit to kill men ? '
` Very little -- as I know ; but if evil men were not now and then slain it would not be a good world for weaponless dreamers .
I do not speak without knowledge who have seen the land from Delhi south awash with blood . '
` What madness was that , then ? '
` The Gods , who sent it for a plague , alone know .
A madness ate into all the Army , and they turned against their officers .
That was the first evil , but not past remedy if they had then held their hands .
But they chose to kill the Sahibs ' wives and children .
Then came the Sahibs from over the sea and called them to most strict account . '
` Some such rumour , I believe , reached me once long ago .
They called it the Black Year , as I remember . '
` What manner of life hast thou led , not to know The Year ?
A rumour indeed !
All earth knew , and trembled ! '
` Our earth never shook but once -- upon the day that the Excellent One received Enlightenment . '
` Umph !
I saw Delhi shake at least -- and Delhi is the navel of the world . '
` So they turned against women and children ?
That was a bad deed , for which the punishment can not be avoided . '
` Many strove to do so , but with very small profit .
I was then in a regiment of cavalry .
It broke .
Of six hundred and eighty sabres stood fast to their salt -- how many , think you ?
Three .
Of whom I was one . '
` The greater merit . '
` Merit !
We did not consider it merit in those days .
My people , my friends , my brothers fell from me .
They said : `` The time of the English is accomplished .
Let each strike out a little holding for himself . ''
But I had talked with the men of Sobraon , of Chilianwallah , of Moodkee and Ferozeshah .
I said : `` Abide a little and the wind turns .
There is no blessing in this work . ''
In those days I rode seventy miles with an English Memsahib and her babe on my saddle-bow .
-LRB- Wow !
That was a horse fit for a man ! -RRB-
I placed them in safety , and back came I to my officer -- the one that was not killed of our five .
`` Give me work , '' said I , `` for I am an outcast among my own kind , and my cousin 's blood is wet on my sabre . ''
`` Be content , '' said he .
`` There is great work forward .
When this madness is over there is a recompense . '' '
` Ay , there is a recompense when the madness is over , surely ? '
the lama muttered half to himself .
` They did not hang medals in those days on all who by accident had heard a gun fired .
No !
In nineteen pitched battles was I ; in six-and-forty skirmishes of horse ; and in small affairs without number .
Nine wounds I bear ; a medal and four clasps and the medal of an Order , for my captains , who are now generals , remembered me when the Kaisar-i-Hind had accomplished fifty years of her reign , and all the land rejoiced .
They said : `` Give him the Order of Berittish India . ''
I carry it upon my neck now .
I have also my jaghir -LSB- holding -RSB- from the hands of the State -- a free gift to me and mine .
The men of the old days -- they are now Commissioners -- come riding to me through the crops -- high upon horses so that all the village sees -- and we talk out the old skirmishes , one dead man 's name leading to another . '
` And after ? '
said the lama .
` Oh , afterwards they go away , but not before my village has seen . '
` And at the last what wilt thou do ? '
` At the last I shall die . '
` And after ? '
` Let the Gods order it .
I have never pestered Them with prayers .
I do not think They will pester me .
Look you , I have noticed in my long life that those who eternally break in upon Those Above with complaints and reports and bellowings and weepings are presently sent for in haste , as our Colonel used to send for slack-jawed down-country men who talked too much .
No , I have never wearied the Gods .
They will remember this , and give me a quiet place where I can drive my lance in the shade , and wait to welcome my sons : I have no less than three Rissaldar -- majors all -- in the regiments . '
` And they likewise , bound upon the Wheel , go forth from life to life -- from despair to despair , ' said the lama below his breath , ` hot , uneasy , snatching . '
` Ay , ' the old soldier chuckled .
` Three Rissaldar -- majors in three regiments .
Gamblers a little , but so am I .
They must be well mounted ; and one can not take the horses as in the old days one took women .
Well , well , my holding can pay for all .
How thinkest thou ?
It is a well-watered strip , but my men cheat me .
I do not know how to ask save at the lance 's point .
Ugh !
I grow angry and I curse them , and they feign penitence , but behind my back I know they call me a toothless old ape . '
` Hast thou never desired any other thing ? '
` Yes -- yes -- a thousand times !
A straight back and a close-clinging knee once more ; a quick wrist and a keen eye ; and the marrow that makes a man .
Oh , the old days -- the good days of my strength ! '
` That strength is weakness . '
` It has turned so ; but fifty years since I could have proved it otherwise , ' the old soldier retorted , driving his stirrup-edge into the pony 's lean flank .
` But I know a River of great healing . ' '
I have drank Gunga-water to the edge of dropsy .
All she gave me was a flux , and no sort of strength . '
` It is not Gunga .
The River that I know washes from all taint of sin .
Ascending the far bank one is assured of Freedom .
I do not know thy life , but thy face is the face of the honourable and courteous .
Thou hast clung to thy Way , rendering fidelity when it was hard to give , in that Black Year of which I now remember other tales .
Enter now upon the Middle Way which is the path to Freedom .
Hear the Most Excellent Law , and do not follow dreams . '
` Speak , then , old man , ' the soldier smiled , half saluting .
` We be all babblers at our age . '
The lama squatted under the shade of a mango , whose shadow played checkerwise over his face ; the soldier sat stiffly on the pony ; and Kim , making sure that there were no snakes , lay down in the crotch of the twisted roots .
There was a drowsy buzz of small life in hot sunshine , a cooing of doves , and a sleepy drone of well-wheels across the fields .
Slowly and impressively the lama began .
At the end of ten minutes the old soldier slid from his pony , to hear better as he said , and sat with the reins round his wrist .
The lama 's voice faltered , the periods lengthened .
Kim was busy watching a grey squirrel .
When the little scolding bunch of fur , close pressed to the branch , disappeared , preacher and audience were fast asleep , the old officer 's strong-cut head pillowed on his arm , the lama 's thrown back against the tree-bole , where it showed like yellow ivory .
A naked child toddled up , stared , and , moved by some quick impulse of reverence , made a solemn little obeisance before the lama -- only the child was so short and fat that it toppled over sideways , and Kim laughed at the sprawling , chubby legs .
The child , scared and indignant , yelled aloud .
` Hai !
Hai ! '
said the soldier , leaping to his feet .
` What is it ?
What orders ?
... It is ... a child !
I dreamed it was an alarm .
Little one -- little one -- do not cry .
Have I slept ?
That was discourteous indeed ! ' '
I fear !
I am afraid ! '
roared the child .
` What is it to fear ?
Two old men and a boy ?
How wilt thou ever make a soldier , Princeling ? '
The lama had waked too , but , taking no direct notice of the child , clicked his rosary .
` What is that ? '
said the child , stopping a yell midway . '
I have never seen such things .
Give them me . '
` Aha . '
said the lama , smiling , and trailing a loop of it on the grass : This is a handful of cardamoms , This is a lump of ghi : This is millet and chillies and rice , A supper for thee and me !
The child shrieked with joy , and snatched at the dark , glancing beads .
` Oho ! '
said the old soldier .
` Whence hadst thou that song , despiser of this world ? ' '
I learned it in Pathankot -- sitting on a doorstep , ' said the lama shyly .
` It is good to be kind to babes . '
` As I remember , before the sleep came on us , thou hadst told me that marriage and bearing were darkeners of the true light , stumbling-blocks upon the Way .
Do children drop from Heaven in thy country ?
Is it the Way to sing them songs ? '
` No man is all perfect , ' said the lama gravely , recoiling the rosary .
` Run now to thy mother , little one . '
` Hear him ! '
said the soldier to Kim .
` He is ashamed for that he has made a child happy .
There was a very good householder lost in thee , my brother .
Hai , child ! '
He threw it a pice .
` Sweetmeats are always sweet . '
And as the little figure capered away into the sunshine : ` They grow up and become men .
Holy One , I grieve that I slept in the midst of thy preaching .
Forgive me . '
` We be two old men , ' said the lama .
` The fault is mine .
I listened to thy talk of the world and its madness , and one fault led to the next . '
` Hear him !
What harm do thy Gods suffer from play with a babe ?
And that song was very well sung .
Let us go on and I will sing thee the song of Nikal Seyn before Delhi -- the old song . '
And they fared out from the gloom of the mango tope , the old man 's high , shrill voice ringing across the field , as wail by long-drawn wail he unfolded the story of Nikal Seyn -LSB- Nicholson -RSB- -- the song that men sing in the Punjab to this day .
Kim was delighted , and the lama listened with deep interest .
` Ahi !
Nikal Seyn is dead -- he died before Delhi !
Lances of the North , take vengeance for Nikal Seyn . '
He quavered it out to the end , marking the trills with the flat of his sword on the pony 's rump .
` And now we come to the Big Road , ' said he , after receiving the compliments of Kim ; for the lama was markedly silent .
` It is long since I have ridden this way , but thy boy 's talk stirred me .
See , Holy One -- the Great Road which is the backbone of all Hind .
For the most part it is shaded , as here , with four lines of trees ; the middle road -- all hard -- takes the quick traffic .
In the days before rail-carriages the Sahibs travelled up and down here in hundreds .
Now there are only country-carts and such like .
Left and right is the rougher road for the heavy carts -- grain and cotton and timber , fodder , lime and hides .
A man goes in safety here for at every few koss is a police-station .
The police are thieves and extortioners -LRB- I myself would patrol it with cavalry -- young recruits under a strong captain -RRB- , but at least they do not suffer any rivals .
All castes and kinds of men move here .
` Look !
Brahmins and chumars , bankers and tinkers , barbers and bunnias , pilgrims and potters -- all the world going and coming .
It is to me as a river from which I am withdrawn like a log after a flood . '
And truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle .
It runs straight , bearing without crowding India 's traffic for fifteen hundred miles -- such a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world .
They looked at the green-arched , shade-flecked length of it , the white breadth speckled with slow-pacing folk ; and the two-roomed police-station opposite .
` Who bears arms against the law ? '
a constable called out laughingly , as he caught sight of the soldier 's sword .
` Are not the police enough to destroy evil-doers ? '
` It was because of the police I bought it , ' was the answer .
` Does all go well in Hind ? '
` Rissaldar Sahib , all goes well . ' '
I am like an old tortoise , look you , who puts his head out from the bank and draws it in again .
Ay , this is the Road of Hindustan .
All men come by this way ... ' ` Son of a swine , is the soft part of the road meant for thee to scratch thy back upon ?
Father of all the daughters of shame and husband of ten thousand virtueless ones , thy mother was devoted to a devil , being led thereto by her mother .
Thy aunts have never had a nose for seven generations !
Thy sister -- What Owl 's folly told thee to draw thy carts across the road ?
A broken wheel ?
Then take a broken head and put the two together at leisure ! '
The voice and a venomous whip-cracking came out of a pillar of dust fifty yards away , where a cart had broken down .
A thin , high Kathiawar mare , with eyes and nostrils aflame , rocketed out of the jam , snorting and wincing as her rider bent her across the road in chase of a shouting man .
He was tall and grey-bearded , sitting the almost mad beast as a piece of her , and scientifically lashing his victim between plunges .
The old man 's face lit with pride .
` My child ! '
said he briefly , and strove to rein the pony 's neck to a fitting arch .
` Am I to be beaten before the police ? '
cried the carter .
` Justice !
I will have Justice -- ' ` Am I to be blocked by a shouting ape who upsets ten thousand sacks under a young horse 's nose ?
That is the way to ruin a mare . '
` He speaks truth .
He speaks truth .
But she follows her man close , ' said the old man .
The carter ran under the wheels of his cart and thence threatened all sorts of vengeance .
` They are strong men , thy sons , ' said the policeman serenely , picking his teeth .
The horseman delivered one last vicious cut with his whip and came on at a canter .
` My father ! '
He reigned back ten yards and dismounted .
The old man was off his pony in an instant , and they embraced as do father and son in the East .
Chapter 4 Good Luck , she is never a lady , But the cursedest quean alive , Tricksy , wincing , and jady -- Kittle to lead or drive .
Greet her -- she 's hailing a stranger !
Meet her -- she 's busking to leave !
Let her alone for a shrew to the bone And the hussy comes plucking your sleeve !
Largesse !
Largesse , O Fortune !
Give or hold at your will .
If I 've no care for Fortune , Fortune must follow me still !
The Wishing-Caps .
Then , lowering their voices , they spoke together .
Kim came to rest under a tree , but the lama tugged impatiently at his elbow .
` Let us go on .
The River is not here . '
` Hai mai !
Have we not walked enough for a little ?
Our River will not run away .
Patience , and he will give us a dole . '
` This . '
said the old soldier suddenly , ` is the Friend of the Stars .
He brought me the news yesterday .
Having seen the very man Himself , in a vision , giving orders for the war . '
` Hm ! '
said his son , all deep in his broad chest .
` He came by a bazar-rumour and made profit of it . '
His father laughed .
` At least he did not ride to me begging for a new charger , and the Gods know how many rupees .
Are thy brothers ' regiments also under orders ? ' '
I do not know .
I took leave and came swiftly to thee in case -- ' ` In case they ran before thee to beg .
O gamblers and spendthrifts all !
But thou hast never yet ridden in a charge .
A good horse is needed there , truly .
A good follower and a good pony also for the marching .
Let us see -- let us see . '
He thrummed on the pommel .
` This is no place to cast accounts in , my father .
Let us go to thy house . '
` At least pay the boy , then : I have no pice with me , and he brought auspicious news .
Ho !
Friend of all the World , a war is toward as thou hast said . '
` Nay , as I know , the war , ' returned Kim composedly .
` Eh ? '
said the lama , fingering his beads , all eager for the road .
` My master does not trouble the Stars for hire .
We brought the news bear witness , we brought the news , and now we go . '
Kim half-crooked his hand at his side .
The son tossed a silver coin through the sunlight , grumbling something about beggars and jugglers .
It was a four-anna piece , and would feed them well for days .
The lama , seeing the flash of the metal , droned a blessing .
` Go thy way , Friend of all the World , ' piped the old soldier , wheeling his scrawny mount .
` For once in all my days I have met a true prophet -- who was not in the Army . '
Father and son swung round together : the old man sitting as erect as the younger .
A Punjabi constable in yellow linen trousers slouched across the road .
He had seen the money pass .
` Halt ! '
he cried in impressive English .
` Know ye not that there is a takkus of two annas a head , which is four annas , on those who enter the Road from this side-road ?
It is the order of the Sirkar , and the money is spent for the planting of trees and the beautification of the ways . '
` And the bellies of the police , ' said Kim , slipping out of arm 's reach .
` Consider for a while , man with a mud head .
Think you we came from the nearest pond like the frog , thy father-in-law ?
Hast thou ever heard the name of thy brother ? '
` And who was he ?
Leave the boy alone , ' cried a senior constable , immensely delighted , as he squatted down to smoke his pipe in the veranda .
` He took a label from a bottle of belaitee-pani -LSB- soda-water -RSB- , and , affixing it to a bridge , collected taxes for a month from those who passed , saying that it was the Sirkar 's order .
Then came an Englishman and broke his head .
Ah , brother , I am a town-crow , not a village-crow ! '
The policeman drew back abashed , and Kim hooted at him all down the road .
` Was there ever such a disciple as I ? '
he cried merrily to the lama .
` All earth would have picked thy bones within ten mile of Lahore city if I had not guarded thee . ' '
I consider in my own mind whether thou art a spirit , sometimes , or sometimes an evil imp , ' said the lama , smiling slowly . '
I am thy chela . '
Kim dropped into step at his side -- that indescribable gait of the long-distance tramp all the world over .
` Now let us walk , ' muttered the lama , and to the click of his rosary they walked in silence mile upon mile .
The lama as usual , was deep in meditation , but Kim 's bright eyes were open wide .
This broad , smiling river of life , he considered , was a vast improvement on the cramped and crowded Lahore streets .
There were new people and new sights at every stride -- castes he knew and castes that were altogether out of his experience .
They met a troop of long-haired , strong-scented Sansis with baskets of lizards and other unclean food on their backs , their lean dogs sniffing at their heels .
These people kept their own side of the road ' , moving at a quick , furtive jog-trot , and all other castes gave them ample room ; for the Sansi is deep pollution .
Behind them , walking wide and stiffly across the strong shadows , the memory of his leg-irons still on him , strode one newly released from the jail ; his full stomach and shiny skin to prove that the Government fed its prisoners better than most honest men could feed themselves .
Kim knew that walk well , and made broad jest of it as they passed .
Then an Akali , a wild-eyed , wild-haired Sikh devotee in the blue-checked clothes of his faith , with polished-steel quoits glistening on the cone of his tall blue turban , stalked past , returning from a visit to one of the independent Sikh States , where he had been singing the ancient glories of the Khalsa to College-trained princelings in top-boots and white-cord breeches .
Kim was careful not to irritate that man ; for the Akali 's temper is short and his arm quick .
Here and there they met or were overtaken by the gaily dressed crowds of whole villages turning out to some local fair ; the women , with their babes on their hips , walking behind the men , the older boys prancing on sticks of sugar-cane , dragging rude brass models of locomotives such as they sell for a halfpenny , or flashing the sun into the eyes of their betters from cheap toy mirrors .
One could see at a glance what each had bought ; and if there were any doubt it needed only to watch the wives comparing , brown arm against brown arm , the newly purchased dull glass bracelets that come from the North-West .
These merry-makers stepped slowly , calling one to the other and stopping to haggle with sweetmeat-sellers , or to make a prayer before one of the wayside shrines -- sometimes Hindu , sometimes Mussalman -- which the low-caste of both creeds share with beautiful impartiality .
A solid line of blue , rising and falling like the back of a caterpillar in haste , would swing up through the quivering dust and trot past to a chorus of quick cackling .
That was a gang of changars -- the women who have taken all the embankments of all the Northern railways under their charge -- a flat-footed , big-bosomed , strong-limbed , blue-petticoated clan of earth-carriers , hurrying north on news of a job , and wasting no time by the road .
They belong to the caste whose men do not count , and they walked with squared elbows , swinging hips , and heads on high , as suits women who carry heavy weights .
A little later a marriage procession would strike into the Grand Trunk with music and shoutings , and a smell of marigold and jasmine stronger even than the reek of the dust .
One could see the bride 's litter , a blur of red and tinsel , staggering through the haze , while the bridegroom 's bewreathed pony turned aside to snatch a mouthful from a passing fodder-cart .
Then Kim would join the Kentish-fire of good wishes and bad jokes , wishing the couple a hundred sons and no daughters , as the saying is .
Still more interesting and more to be shouted over it was when a strolling juggler with some half-trained monkeys , or a panting , feeble bear , or a woman who tied goats ' horns to her feet , and with these danced on a slack-rope , set the horses to shying and the women to shrill , long-drawn quavers of amazement .
The lama never raised his eyes .
He did not note the money-lender on his goose-rumped pony , hastening along to collect the cruel interest ; or the long-shouting , deep-voiced little mob -- still in military formation -- of native soldiers on leave , rejoicing to be rid of their breeches and puttees , and saying the most outrageous things to the most respectable women in sight .
Even the seller of Ganges-water he did not see , and Kim expected that he would at least buy a bottle of that precious stuff .
He looked steadily at the ground , and strode as steadily hour after hour , his soul busied elsewhere .
But Kim was in the seventh heaven of joy .
The Grand Trunk at this point was built on an embankment to guard against winter floods from the foothills , so that one walked , as it were , a little above the country , along a stately corridor , seeing all India spread out to left and right .
It was beautiful to behold the many-yoked grain and cotton wagons crawling over the country roads : one could hear their axles , complaining a mile away , coming nearer , till with shouts and yells and bad words they climbed up the steep incline and plunged on to the hard main road , carter reviling carter .
It was equally beautiful to watch the people , little clumps of red and blue and pink and white and saffron , turning aside to go to their own villages , dispersing and growing small by twos and threes across the level plain .
Kim felt these things , though he could not give tongue to his feelings , and so contented himself with buying peeled sugar-cane and spitting the pith generously about his path .
From time to time the lama took snuff , and at last Kim could endure the silence no longer .
` This is a good land -- the land of the South ! '
said he .
` The air is good ; the water is good .
Eh ? '
` And they are all bound upon the Wheel , ' said the lama .
` Bound from life after life .
To none of these has the Way been shown . '
He shook himself back to this world .
` And now we have walked a weary way , ' said Kim .
` Surely we shall soon come to a parao -LSB- a resting-place -RSB- .
Shall we stay there ?
Look , the sun is sloping . '
` Who will receive us this evening ? '
` That is all one .
This country is full of good folk .
Besides ' he sunk his voice beneath a whisper -- ` we have money . '
The crowd thickened as they neared the resting-place which marked the end of their day 's journey .
A line of stalls selling very simple food and tobacco , a stack of firewood , a police-station , a well , a horse-trough , a few trees , and , under them , some trampled ground dotted with the black ashes of old fires , are all that mark a parao on the Grand Trunk ; if you except the beggars and the crows -- both hungry .
By this time the sun was driving broad golden spokes through the lower branches of the mango-trees ; the parakeets and doves were coming home in their hundreds ; the chattering , grey-backed Seven Sisters , talking over the day 's adventures , walked back and forth in twos and threes almost under the feet of the travellers ; and shufflings and scufflings in the branches showed that the bats were ready to go out on the night-picket .
Swiftly the light gathered itself together , painted for an instant the faces and the cartwheels and the bullocks ' horns as red as blood .
Then the night fell , changing the touch of the air , drawing a low , even haze , like a gossamer veil of blue , across the face of the country , and bringing out , keen and distinct , the smell of wood-smoke and cattle and the good scent of wheaten cakes cooked on ashes .
The evening patrol hurried out of the police-station with important coughings and reiterated orders ; and a live charcoal ball in the cup of a wayside carter 's hookah glowed red while Kim 's eye mechanically watched the last flicker of the sun on the brass tweezers .
The life of the parao was very like that of the Kashmir Serai on a small scale .
Kim dived into the happy Asiatic disorder which , if you only allow time , will bring you everything that a simple man needs .
His wants were few , because , since the lama had no caste scruples , cooked food from the nearest stall would serve ; but , for luxury 's sake , Kim bought a handful of dung-cakes to build a fire .
All about , coming and going round the little flames , men cried for oil , or grain , or sweetmeats , or tobacco , jostling one another while they waited their turn at the well ; and under the men 's voices you heard from halted , shuttered carts the high squeals and giggles of women whose faces should not be seen in public .
Nowadays , well-educated natives are of opinion that when their womenfolk travel -- and they visit a good deal -- it is better to take them quickly by rail in a properly screened compartment ; and that custom is spreading .
But there are always those of the old rock who hold by the use of their forefathers ; and , above all , there are always the old women -- more conservative than the men -- who toward the end of their days go on a pilgrimage .
They , being withered and undesirable , do not , under certain circumstances , object to unveiling .
After their long seclusion , during which they have always been in business touch with a thousand outside interests , they love the bustle and stir of the open road , the gatherings at the shrines , and the infinite possibilities of gossip with like-minded dowagers .
Very often it suits a longsuffering family that a strong-tongued , iron-willed old lady should disport herself about India in this fashion ; for certainly pilgrimage is grateful to the Gods .
So all about India , in the most remote places , as in the most public , you find some knot of grizzled servitors in nominal charge of an old lady who is more or less curtained and hid away in a bullock-cart .
Such men are staid and discreet , and when a European or a high-caste native is near will net their charge with most elaborate precautions ; but in the ordinary haphazard chances of pilgrimage the precautions are not taken .
The old lady is , after all , intensely human , and lives to look upon life .
Kim marked down a gaily ornamented ruth or family bullock-cart , with a broidered canopy of two domes , like a double-humped camel , which had just been drawn into the par .
Eight men made its retinue , and two of the eight were armed with rusty sabres -- sure signs that they followed a person of distinction , for the common folk do not bear arms .
An increasing cackle of complaints , orders , and jests , and what to a European would have been bad language , came from behind the curtains .
Here was evidently a woman used to command .
Kim looked over the retinue critically .
Half of them were thin-legged , grey-bearded Ooryas from down country .
The other half were duffle-clad , felt-hatted hillmen of the North ; and that mixture told its own tale , even if he had not overheard the incessant sparring between the two divisions .
The old lady was going south on a visit -- probably to a rich relative , most probably to a son-in-law , who had sent up an escort as a mark of respect .
The hillmen would be of her own people -- Kulu or Kangra folk .
It was quite clear that she was not taking her daughter down to be wedded , or the curtains would have been laced home and the guard would have allowed no one near the car .
A merry and a high-spirited dame , thought Kim , balancing the dung-cake in one hand , the cooked food in the other , and piloting the lama with a nudging shoulder .
Something might be made out of the meeting .
The lama would give him no help , but , as a conscientious chela , Kim was delighted to beg for two .
He built his fire as close to the cart as he dared , waiting for one of the escort to order him away .
The lama dropped wearily to the ground , much as a heavy fruit-eating bat cowers , and returned to his rosary .
` Stand farther off , beggar ! '
The order was shouted in broken Hindustani by one of the hillmen .
` Huh !
It is only a pahari -LSB- a hillman -RSB- ' , said Kim over his shoulder .
` Since when have the hill-asses owned all Hindustan ? '
The retort was a swift and brilliant sketch of Kim 's pedigree for three generations .
` Ah ! '
Kim 's voice was sweeter than ever , as he broke the dung-cake into fit pieces .
` In my country we call that the beginning of love-talk . '
A harsh , thin cackle behind the curtains put the hillman on his mettle for a second shot .
` Not so bad -- not so bad , ' said Kim with calm .
` But have a care , my brother , lest we -- we , I say -- be minded to give a curse or so in return .
And our curses have the knack of biting home . '
The Ooryas laughed ; the hillman sprang forward threateningly .
The lama suddenly raised his head , bringing his huge tam-o ' - shanter hat into the full light of Kim 's new-started fire .
` What is it ? '
said he .
The man halted as though struck to stone .
` I -- I -- am saved from a great sin , ' he stammered .
` The foreigner has found him a priest at last , ' whispered one of the Ooryas .
` Hai !
Why is that beggar-brat not well beaten ? '
the old woman cried .
The hillman drew back to the cart and whispered something to the curtain .
There was dead silence , then a muttering .
` This goes well , ' thought Kim , pretending neither to see nor hear .
` When -- when -- he has eaten ' -- the hillman fawned on Kim -- ` it -- it is requested that the Holy One will do the honour to talk to one who would speak to him . '
` After he has eaten he will sleep , ' Kim returned loftily .
He could not quite see what new turn the game had taken , but stood resolute to profit by it .
` Now I will get him his food . '
The last sentence , spoken loudly , ended with a sigh as of faintness .
` I -- I myself and the others of my people will look to that -- if it is permitted . '
` It is permitted , ' said Kim , more loftily than ever .
` Holy One , these people will bring us food . '
` The land is good .
All the country of the South is good -- a great and a terrible world , ' mumbled the lama drowsily .
` Let him sleep , ' said Kim , ` but look to it that we are well fed when he wakes .
He is a very holy man . '
Again one of the Ooryas said something contemptuously .
` He is not a fakir .
He is not a down-country beggar , ' Kim went on severely , addressing the stars .
` He is the most holy of holy men .
He is above all castes .
I am his chela . '
` Come here ! '
said the flat thin voice behind the curtain ; and Kim came , conscious that eyes he could not see were staring at him .
One skinny brown finger heavy with rings lay on the edge of the cart , and the talk went this way : ` Who is that one ? '
` An exceedingly holy one .
He comes from far off .
He comes from Tibet . '
` Where in Tibet ? '
` From behind the snows -- from a very far place .
He knows the stars ; he makes horoscopes ; he reads nativities .
But he does not do this for money .
He does it for kindness and great charity .
I am his disciple .
I am called also the Friend of the Stars . '
` Thou art no hillman . '
` Ask him .
He will tell thee I was sent to him from the Stars to show him an end to his pilgrimage . '
` Humph !
Consider , brat , that I am an old woman and not altogether a fool .
Lamas I know , and to these I give reverence , but thou art no more a lawful chela than this my finger is the pole of this wagon .
Thou art a casteless Hindu -- a bold and unblushing beggar , attached , belike , to the Holy One for the sake of gain . '
` Do we not all work for gain ? '
Kim changed his tone promptly to match that altered voice . '
I have heard ' -- this was a bow drawn at a venture -- ' I have heard -- ' ` What hast thou heard ? '
she snapped , rapping with the finger .
` Nothing that I well remember , but some talk in the bazars , which is doubtless a lie , that even Rajahs -- small Hill Rajahs -- ' ` But none the less of good Rajput blood . '
` Assuredly of good blood .
That these even sell the more comely of their womenfolk for gain .
Down south they sell them -- to zemindars and such -- all of Oudh . '
If there be one thing in the world that the small Hill Rajahs deny it is just this charge ; but it happens to be one thing that the bazars believe , when they discuss the mysterious slave-traffics of India .
The old lady explained to Kim , in a tense , indignant whisper , precisely what manner and fashion of malignant liar he was .
Had Kim hinted this when she was a girl , he would have been pommelled to death that same evening by an elephant .
This was perfectly true .
` Ahai !
I am only a beggar 's brat , as the Eye of Beauty has said , ' he wailed in extravagant terror .
` Eye of Beauty , forsooth !
Who am I that thou shouldst fling beggar-endearments at me ? '
And yet she laughed at the long-forgotten word .
` Forty years ago that might have been said , and not without truth .
Ay .
thirty years ago .
But it is the fault of this gadding up and down Hind that a king 's widow must jostle all the scum of the land , and be made a mock by beggars . '
` Great Queen , ' said Kim promptly , for he heard her shaking with indignation , ' I am even what the Great Queen says I am ; but none the less is my master holy .
He has not yet heard the Great Queen 's order that -- ' ` Order ?
I order a Holy One -- a Teacher of the Law -- to come and speak to a woman ?
Never ! '
` Pity my stupidity .
I thought it was given as an order -- ' ` It was not .
It was a petition .
Does this make all clear ? '
A silver coin clicked on the edge of the cart .
Kim took it and salaamed profoundly .
The old lady recognized that , as the eyes and the ears of the lama , he was to be propitiated . '
I am but the Holy One 's disciple .
When he has eaten perhaps he will come . '
` Oh , villain and shameless rogue ! '
The jewelled forefinger shook itself at him reprovingly ; but he could hear the old lady 's chuckle .
` Nay , what is it ? '
he said , dropping into his most caressing and confidential tone -- the one , he well knew , that few could resist .
` Is -- is there any need of a son in thy family ?
Speak freely , for we priests -- ' That last was a direct plagiarism from a fakir by the Taksali Gate .
` We priests !
Thou art not yet old enough to -- ' She checked the joke with another laugh .
` Believe me , now and again , we women , O priest , think of other matters than sons .
Moreover , my daughter has borne her man-child . '
` Two arrows in the quiver are better than one ; and three are better still . '
Kim quoted the proverb with a meditative cough , looking discreetly earthward .
` True -- oh , true .
But perhaps that will come .
Certainly those down-country Brahmins are utterly useless .
I sent gifts and monies and gifts again to them , and they prophesied . '
` Ah , ' drawled Kim , with infinite contempt , ` they prophesied ! '
A professional could have done no better .
` And it was not till I remembered my own Gods that my prayers were heard .
I chose an auspicious hour , and -- perhaps thy Holy One has heard of the Abbot of the Lung-Cho lamassery .
It was to him I put the matter , and behold in the due time all came about as I desired .
The Brahmin in the house of the father of my daughter 's son has since said that it was through his prayers -- which is a little error that I will explain to him when we reach our journey 's end .
And so afterwards I go to Buddh Gaya , to make shraddha for the father of my children . '
` Thither go we . '
` Doubly auspicious , ' chirruped the old lady . '
A second son at least ! ' '
O Friend of all the World ! '
The lama had waked , and , simply as a child bewildered in a strange bed , called for Kim . '
I come !
I come , Holy One ! '
He dashed to the fire , where he found the lama already surrounded by dishes of food , the hillmen visibly adoring him and the Southerners looking sourly .
` Go back !
Withdraw ! '
Kim cried .
` Do we eat publicly like dogs ? '
They finished the meal in silence , each turned a little from the other , and Kim topped it with a native-made cigarette .
` Have I not said an hundred times that the South is a good land ?
Here is a virtuous and high-born widow of a Hill Rajah on pilgrimage , she says , to Buddha Gay .
She it is sends us those dishes ; and when thou art well rested she would speak to thee . '
` Is this also thy work ? '
The lama dipped deep into his snuff-gourd .
` Who else watched over thee since our wonderful journey began ? '
Kim 's eyes danced in his head as he blew the rank smoke through his nostrils and stretched him on the dusty ground .
` Have I failed to oversee thy comforts , Holy One ? ' '
A blessing on thee . '
The lama inclined his solemn head . '
I have known many men in my so long life , and disciples not a few .
But to none among men , if so be thou art woman-born , has my heart gone out as it has to thee -- thoughtful , wise , and courteous ; but something of a small imp . '
` And I have never seen such a priest as thou . '
Kim considered the benevolent yellow face wrinkle by wrinkle .
` It is less than three days since we took the road together , and it is as though it were a hundred years . '
` Perhaps in a former life it was permitted that I should have rendered thee some service .
Maybe ' -- he smiled -- ' I freed thee from a trap ; or , having caught thee on a hook in the days when I was not enlightened , cast thee back into the river . '
` Maybe , ' said Kim quietly .
He had heard this sort of speculation again and again , from the mouths of many whom the English would not consider imaginative .
` Now , as regards that woman in the bullock-cart .
I think she needs a second son for her daughter . '
` That is no part of the Way , ' sighed the lama .
` But at least she is from the Hills .
Ah , the Hills , and the snow of the Hills ! '
He rose and stalked to the cart .
Kim would have given his ears to come too , but the lama did not invite him ; and the few words he caught were in an unknown tongue , for they spoke some common speech of the mountains .
The woman seemed to ask questions which the lama turned over in his mind before answering .
Now and again he heard the singsong cadence of a Chinese quotation .
It was a strange picture that Kim watched between drooped eyelids .
The lama , very straight and erect , the deep folds of his yellow clothing slashed with black in the light of the parao fires precisely as a knotted tree-trunk is slashed with the shadows of the low sun , addressed a tinsel and lacquered ruth which burned like a many-coloured jewel in the same uncertain light .
The patterns on the gold-worked curtains ran up and down , melting and reforming as the folds shook and quivered to the night wind ; and when the talk grew more earnest the jewelled forefinger snapped out little sparks of light between the embroideries .
Behind the cart was a wall of uncertain darkness speckled with little flames and alive with half-caught forms and faces and shadows .
The voices of early evening had settled down to one soothing hum whose deepest note was the steady chumping of the bullocks above their chopped straw , and whose highest was the tinkle of a Bengali dancing-girl 's sitar .
Most men had eaten and pulled deep at their gurgling , grunting hookahs , which in full blast sound like bull-frogs .
At last the lama returned .
A hillman walked behind him with a wadded cotton-quilt and spread it carefully by the fire .
` She deserves ten thousand grandchildren , ' thought Kim .
` None the less , but for me , those gifts would not have come . ' '
A virtuous woman -- and a wise one . '
The lama slackened off , joint by joint , like a slow camel .
` The world is full of charity to those who follow the Way . '
He flung a fair half of the quilt over Kim .
` And what said she ? '
Kim rolled up in his share of it .
` She asked me many questions and propounded many problems -- the most of which were idle tales which she had heard from devil-serving priests who pretend to follow the Way .
Some I answered , and some I said were foolish .
Many wear the Robe , but few keep the Way . '
` True .
That is true . '
Kim used the thoughtful , conciliatory tone of those who wish to draw confidences .
` But by her lights she is most right-minded .
She desires greatly that we should go with her to Buddh Gaya ; her road being ours , as I understand , for many days ' journey to the southward . '
` And ? '
` Patience a little .
To this I said that my Search came before all things .
She had heard many foolish legends , but this great truth of my River she had never heard .
Such are the priests of the lower hills !
She knew the Abbot of Lung-Cho , but she did not know of my River -- nor the tale of the Arrow . '
` And ? ' '
I spoke therefore of the Search , and of the Way , and of matters that were profitable ; she desiring only that I should accompany her and make prayer for a second son . '
` Aha !
`` We women '' do not think of anything save children , ' said Kim sleepily .
` Now , since our roads run together for a while , I do not see that we in any way depart from our Search if so be we accompany her -- at least as far as -- I have forgotten the name of the city . '
` Ohe ! '
said Kim , turning and speaking in a sharp whisper to one of the Ooryas a few yards away .
` Where is your master 's house ? ' '
A little behind Saharunpore , among the fruit gardens . '
He named the village .
` That was the place , ' said the lama .
` So far , at least , we can go with her . '
` Flies go to carrion , ' said the Oorya , in an abstracted voice .
` For the sick cow a crow ; for the sick man a Brahmin . '
Kim breathed the proverb impersonally to the shadow-tops of the trees overhead .
The Oorya grunted and held his peace .
` So then we go with her , Holy One ? '
` Is there any reason against ?
I can still step aside and try all the rivers that the road overpasses .
She desires that I should come .
She very greatly desires it . '
Kim stifled a laugh in the quilt .
When once that imperious old lady had recovered from her natural awe of a lama he thought it probable that she would be worth listening to .
He was nearly asleep when the lama suddenly quoted a proverb : ` The husbands of the talkative have a great reward hereafter . '
Then Kim heard him snuff thrice , and dozed off , still laughing .
The diamond-bright dawn woke men and crows and bullocks together .
Kim sat up and yawned , shook himself , and thrilled with delight .
This was seeing the world in real truth ; this was life as he would have it -- bustling and shouting , the buckling of belts , and beating of bullocks and creaking of wheels , lighting of fires and cooking of food , and new sights at every turn of the approving eye .
The morning mist swept off in a whorl of silver , the parrots shot away to some distant river in shrieking green hosts : all the well-wheels within ear-shot went to work .
India was awake , and Kim was in the middle of it , more awake and more excited than anyone , chewing on a twig that he would presently use as a toothbrush ; for he borrowed right - and left-handedly from all the customs of the country he knew and loved .
There was no need to worry about food -- no need to spend a cowrie at the crowded stalls .
He was the disciple of a holy man annexed by a strong-willed old lady .
All things would be prepared for them , and when they were respectfully invited so to do they would sit and eat .
For the rest -- Kim giggled here as he cleaned his teeth -- his hostess would rather heighten the enjoyment of the road .
He inspected her bullocks critically , as they came up grunting and blowing under the yokes .
If they went too fast -- it was not likely -- there would be a pleasant seat for himself along the pole ; the lama would sit beside the driver .
The escort , of course , would walk .
The old lady , equally of course , would talk a great deal , and by what he had heard that conversation would not lack salt .
She was already ordering , haranguing , rebuking , and , it must be said , cursing her servants for delays .
` Get her her pipe .
In the name of the Gods , get her her pipe and stop her ill-omened mouth , ' cried an Oorya , tying up his shapeless bundles of bedding .
` She and the parrots are alike .
They screech in the dawn . '
` The lead-bullocks !
Hai !
Look to the lead-bullocks ! '
They were backing and wheeling as a grain-cart 's axle caught them by the horns .
` Son of an owl , where dost thou go ? '
This to the grinning carter .
` Ai !
Yai !
Yai !
That within there is the Queen of Delhi going to pray for a son , ' the man called back over his high load .
` Room for the Queen of Delhi and her Prime Minister the grey monkey climbing up his own sword ! '
Another cart loaded with bark for a down-country tannery followed close behind , and its driver added a few compliments as the ruth-bullocks backed and backed again .
From behind the shaking curtains came one volley of invective .
It did not last long , but in kind and quality , in blistering , biting appropriateness , it was beyond anything that even Kim had heard .
He could see the carter 's bare chest collapse with amazement , as the man salaamed reverently to the voice , leaped from the pole , and helped the escort haul their volcano on to the main road .
Here the voice told him truthfully what sort of wife he had wedded , and what she was doing in his absence .
` Oh , shabash ! '
murmured Kim , unable to contain himself , as the man slunk away .
` Well done , indeed ?
It is a shame and a scandal that a poor woman may not go to make prayer to her Gods except she be jostled and insulted by all the refuse of Hindustan -- that she must eat gali -LSB- abuse -RSB- as men eat ghi .
But I have yet a wag left to my tongue -- a word or two well spoken that serves the occasion .
And still am I without my tobacco !
Who is the one-eyed and luckless son of shame that has not yet prepared my pipe ? '
It was hastily thrust in by a hillman , and a trickle of thick smoke from each corner of the curtains showed that peace was restored .
If Kim had walked proudly the day before , disciple of a holy man , today he paced with tenfold pride in the train of a semi-royal procession , with a recognized place under the patronage of an old lady of charming manners and infinite resource .
The escort , their heads tied up native-fashion , fell in on either side the cart , shuffling enormous clouds of dust .
The lama and Kim walked a little to one side ; Kim chewing his stick of sugarcane , and making way for no one under the status of a priest .
They could hear the old lady 's tongue clack as steadily as a rice-husker .
She bade the escort tell her what was going on on the road ; and so soon as they were clear of the parao she flung back the curtains and peered out , her veil a third across her face .
Her men did not eye her directly when she addressed them , and thus the proprieties were more or less observed .
A dark , sallowish District Superintendent of Police , faultlessly uniformed , an Englishman , trotted by on a tired horse , and , seeing from her retinue what manner of person she was , chaffed her . '
O mother , ' he cried , ` do they do this in the zenanas ?
Suppose an Englishman came by and saw that thou hast no nose ? '
` What ? '
she shrilled back .
` Thine own mother has no nose ?
Why say so , then , on the open road ? '
It was a fair counter .
The Englishman threw up his hand with the gesture of a man hit at sword-play .
She laughed and nodded .
` Is this a face to tempt virtue aside ? '
She withdrew all her veil and stared at him .
It was by no means lovely , but as the man gathered up his reins he called it a Moon of Paradise , a Disturber of Integrity , and a few other fantastic epithets which doubled her up with mirth .
` That is a nut-cut -LSB- rogue -RSB- , ' she said .
` All police-constables are nut-cuts ; but the police-wallahs are the worst .
Hai , my son , thou hast never learned all that since thou camest from Belait -LSB- Europe -RSB- .
Who suckled thee ? ' '
A pahareen -- a hillwoman of Dalhousie , my mother .
Keep thy beauty under a shade -- O Dispenser of Delights , ' and he was gone .
` These be the sort ' -- she took a fine judicial tone , and stuffed her mouth with pan -- ` These be the sort to oversee justice .
They know the land and the customs of the land .
The others , all new from Europe , suckled by white women and learning our tongues from books , are worse than the pestilence .
They do harm to Kings . '
Then she told a long , long tale to the world at large , of an ignorant young policeman who had disturbed some small Hill Rajah , a ninth cousin of her own , in the matter of a trivial land-case , winding up with a quotation from a work by no means devotional .
Then her mood changed , and she bade one of the escort ask whether the lama would walk alongside and discuss matters of religion .
So Kim dropped back into the dust and returned to his sugar-cane .
For an hour or more the lama 's tam-o'shanter showed like a moon through the haze ; and , from all he heard , Kim gathered that the old woman wept .
One of the Ooryas half apologized for his rudeness overnight , saying that he had never known his mistress of so bland a temper , and he ascribed it to the presence of the strange priest .
Personally , he believed in Brahmins , though , like all natives , he was acutely aware of their cunning and their greed .
Still , when Brahmins but irritated with begging demands the mother of his master 's wife , and when she sent them away so angry that they cursed the whole retinue -LRB- which was the real reason of the second off-side bullock going lame , and of the pole breaking the night before -RRB- , he was prepared to accept any priest of any other denomination in or out of India .
To this Kim assented with wise nods , and bade the Oorya observe that the lama took no money , and that the cost of his and Kim 's food would be repaid a hundred times in the good luck that would attend the caravan henceforward .
He also told stories of Lahore city , and sang a song or two which made the escort laugh .
As a town-mouse well acquainted with the latest songs by the most fashionable composers -- they are women for the most part -- Kim had a distinct advantage over men from a little fruit-village behind Saharunpore , but he let that advantage be inferred .
At noon they turned aside to eat , and the meal was good , plentiful , and well-served on plates of clean leaves , in decency , out of drift of the dust .
They gave the scraps to certain beggars , that all requirements might be fulfilled , and sat down to a long , luxurious smoke .
The old lady had retreated behind her curtains , but mixed most freely in the talk , her servants arguing with and contradicting her as servants do throughout the East .
She compared the cool and the pines of the Kangra and Kulu hills with the dust and the mangoes of the South ; she told a tale of some old local Gods at the edge of her husband 's territory ; she roundly abused the tobacco which she was then smoking , reviled all Brahmins , and speculated without reserve on the coming of many grandsons .
Chapter 5 Here come I to my own again Fed , forgiven , and known again Claimed by bone of my bone again , And sib to flesh of my flesh !
The fatted calf is dressed for me , But the husks have greater zest for me ... I think my pigs will be best for me , So I 'm off to the styes afresh .
The Prodigal Son .
Once more the lazy , string-tied , shuffling procession got under way , and she slept till they reached the next halting-stage .
It was a very short march , and time lacked an hour to sundown , so Kim cast about for means of amusement .
` But why not sit and rest ? '
said one of the escort .
` Only the devils and the English walk to and fro without reason . '
` Never make friends with the Devil , a Monkey , or a Boy .
No man knows what they will do next , ' said his fellow .
Kim turned a scornful back -- he did not want to hear the old story how the Devil played with the boys and repented of it and walked idly across country .
The lama strode after him .
All that day , whenever they passed a stream , he had turned aside to look at it , but in no case had he received any warning that he had found his River .
Insensibly , too , the comfort of speaking to someone in a reasonable tongue , and of being properly considered and respected as her spiritual adviser by a well-born woman , had weaned his thoughts a little from the Search .
And further , he was prepared to spend serene years in his quest ; having nothing of the white man 's impatience , but a great faith .
` Where goest thou ? '
he called after Kim .
` Nowhither -- it was a small march , and all this ' -- Kim waved his hands abroad -- ` is new to me . '
` She is beyond question a wise and a discerning woman .
But it is hard to meditate when -- ' ` All women are thus . '
Kim spoke as might have Solomon .
` Before the lamassery was a broad platform , ' the lama muttered , looping up the well-worn rosary , ` of stone .
On that I have left the marks of my feet -- pacing to and fro with these . '
He clicked the beads , and began the ` Om mane pudme hum 's of his devotion ; grateful for the cool , the quiet , and the absence of dust .
One thing after another drew Kim 's idle eye across the plain .
There was no purpose in his wanderings , except that the build of the huts near by seemed new , and he wished to investigate .
They came out on a broad tract of grazing-ground , brown and purple in the afternoon light , with a heavy clump of mangoes in the centre .
It struck Kim as curious that no shrine stood in so eligible a spot : the boy was observing as any priest for these things .
Far across the plain walked side by side four men , made small by the distance .
He looked intently under his curved palms and caught the sheen of brass .
` Soldiers .
White soldiers ! '
said he .
` Let us see . '
` It is always soldiers when thou and I go out alone together .
But I have never seen the white soldiers . '
` They do no harm except when they are drunk .
Keep behind this tree . '
They stepped behind the thick trunks in the cool dark of the mango-tope .
Two little figures halted ; the other two came forward uncertainly .
They were the advance-party of a regiment on the march , sent out , as usual , to mark the camp .
They bore five-foot sticks with fluttering flags , and called to each other as they spread over the flat earth .
At last they entered the mango-grove , walking heavily .
` It 's here or hereabouts -- officers ' tents under the trees , I take it , an ' the rest of us can stay outside .
Have they marked out for the baggage-wagons behind ? '
They cried again to their comrades in the distance , and the rough answer came back faint and mellowed .
` Shove the flag in here , then , ' said one .
` What do they prepare ? '
said the lama , wonderstruck .
` This is a great and terrible world .
What is the device on the flag ? '
A soldier thrust a stave within a few feet of them , grunted discontentedly , pulled it up again , conferred with his companion , who looked up and down the shaded cave of greenery , and returned it .
Kim stared with all his eyes , his breath coming short and sharp between his teeth .
The soldiers stamped off into the sunshine . '
O Holy One ! '
he gasped .
` My horoscope !
The drawing in the dust by the priest at Umballa !
Remember what he said .
First come two -- ferashes -- to make all things ready -- in a dark place , as it is always at the beginning of a vision . '
` But this is not vision , ' said the lama .
` It is the world 's Illusion , and no more . '
` And after them comes the Bull -- the Red Bull on the green field .
Look !
It is he ! '
He pointed to the flag that was snap snapping in the evening breeze not ten feet away .
It was no more than an ordinary camp marking-flag ; but the regiment , always punctilious in matters of millinery , had charged it with the regimental device , the Red Bull , which is the crest of the Mavericks -- the great Red Bull on a background of Irish green . '
I see , and now I remember . '
said the lama .
` Certainly it is thy Bull .
Certainly , also , the two men came to make all ready . '
` They are soldiers -- white soldiers .
What said the priest ?
`` The sign over against the Bull is the sign of War and armed men . ''
Holy One , this thing touches my Search . '
` True .
It is true . '
The lama stared fixedly at the device that flamed like a ruby in the dusk .
` The priest at Umballa said that thine was the sign of War . '
` What is to do now ? '
` Wait .
Let us wait . '
` Even now the darkness clears , ' said Kim .
It was only natural that the descending sun should at last strike through the tree-trunks , across the grove , filling it with mealy gold light for a few minutes ; but to Kim it was the crown of the Umballa Brahmin 's prophecy .
` Hark ! '
said the lama .
` One beats a drum -- far off ! '
At first the sound , carrying diluted through the still air , resembled the beating of an artery in the head .
Soon a sharpness was added .
` Ah !
The music , ' Kim explained .
He knew the sound of a regimental band , but it amazed the lama .
At the far end of the plain a heavy , dusty column crawled in sight .
Then the wind brought the tune : We crave your condescension To tell you what we know Of marching in the Mulligan Guards To Sligo Port below !
Here broke in the shrill-tongued fifes : We shouldered arms , We marched -- we marched away .
From Phoenix Park We marched to Dublin Bay .
The drums and the fifes , Oh , sweetly they did play , As we marched -- marched -- marched -- with the Mulligan Guards !
It was the band of the Mavericks playing the regiment to camp ; for the men were route-marching with their baggage .
The rippling column swung into the level -- carts behind it divided left and right , ran about like an ant-hill , and ... ` But this is sorcery ! '
said the lama .
The plain dotted itself with tents that seemed to rise , all spread , from the carts .
Another rush of men invaded the grove , pitched a huge tent in silence , ran up yet eight or nine more by the side of it , unearthed cooking-pots , pans , and bundles , which were taken possession of by a crowd of native servants ; and behold the mango-tope turned into an orderly town as they watched !
` Let us go , ' said the lama , sinking back afraid , as the fires twinkled and white officers with jingling swords stalked into the Mess-tent .
` Stand back in the shadow .
No one can see beyond the light of a fire , ' said Kim , his eyes still on the flag .
He had never before watched the routine of a seasoned regiment pitching camp in thirty minutes .
` Look !
look !
look ! '
clucked the lama .
` Yonder comes a priest . '
It was Bennett , the Church of England Chaplain of the regiment , limping in dusty black .
One of his flock had made some rude remarks about the Chaplain 's mettle ; and to abash him Bennett had marched step by step with the men that day .
The black dress , gold cross on the watch-chain , the hairless face , and the soft , black wideawake hat would have marked him as a holy man anywhere in all India .
He dropped into a camp-chair by the door of the Mess-tent and slid off his boots .
Three or four officers gathered round him , laughing and joking over his exploit .
` The talk of white men is wholly lacking in dignity , ' said the lama , who judged only by tone .
` But I considered the countenance of that priest and I think he is learned .
Is it likely that he will understand our talk ?
I would talk to him of my Search . '
` Never speak to a white man till he is fed , ' said Kim , quoting a well-known proverb .
` They will eat now , and -- and I do not think they are good to beg from .
Let us go back to the resting-place .
After we have eaten we will come again .
It certainly was a Red Bull -- my Red Bull . '
They were both noticeably absent-minded when the old lady 's retinue set their meal before them ; so none broke their reserve , for it is not lucky to annoy guests .
` Now , ' said Kim , picking his teeth , ` we will return to that place ; but thou , O Holy One , must wait a little way off , because thy feet are heavier than mine and I am anxious to see more of that Red Bull . '
` But how canst thou understand the talk ?
Walk slowly .
The road is dark , ' the lama replied uneasily .
Kim put the question aside . '
I marked a place near to the trees , ' said he , ` where thou canst sit till I call .
Nay , ' as the lama made some sort of protest , ` remember this is my Search -- the Search for my Red Bull .
The sign in the Stars was not for thee .
I know a little of the customs of white soldiers , and I always desire to see some new things . '
` What dost thou not know of this world ? '
The lama squatted obediently in a little hollow of the ground not a hundred yards from the hump of the mango-trees dark against the star-powdered sky .
` Stay till I call . '
Kim flitted into the dusk .
He knew that in all probability there would be sentries round the camp , and smiled to himself as he heard the thick boots of one .
A boy who can dodge over the roofs of Lahore city on a moonlight night , using every little patch and corner of darkness to discomfit his pursuer , is not likely to be checked by a line of well-trained soldiers .
He paid them the compliment of crawling between a couple , and , running and halting , crouching and dropping flat , worked his way toward the lighted Mess-tent where , close pressed behind the mango-tree , he waited till some chance word should give him a returnable lead .
The one thing now in his mind was further information as to the Red Bull .
For aught he knew , and Kim 's limitations were as curious and sudden as his expansions , the men , the nine hundred thorough devils of his father 's prophecy , might pray to the beast after dark , as Hindus pray to the Holy Cow .
That at least would be entirely right and logical , and the padre with the gold cross would be therefore the man to consult in the matter .
On the other hand , remembering sober-faced padres whom he had avoided in Lahore city , the priest might be an inquisitive nuisance who would bid him learn .
But had it not been proven at Umballa that his sign in the high heavens portended War and armed men ?
Was he not the Friend of the Stars as well as of all the World , crammed to the teeth with dreadful secrets ?
Lastly -- and firstly as the undercurrent of all his quick thoughts -- this adventure , though he did not know the English word , was a stupendous lark -- a delightful continuation of his old flights across the housetops , as well as the fulfilment of sublime prophecy .
He lay belly-flat and wriggled towards the Mess-tent door , a hand on the amulet round his neck .
It was as he suspected .
The Sahibs prayed to their God ; for in the centre of the Mess-table -- its sole ornament when they were on the line of march -- stood a golden bull fashioned from old-time loot of the Summer Palace at Pekin -- a red-gold bull with lowered head , ramping upon a field of Irish green .
To him the Sahibs held out their glasses and cried aloud confusedly .
Now the Reverend Arthur Bennett always left Mess after that toast , and being rather tired by his march his movements were more abrupt than usual .
Kim , with slightly raised head , was still staring at his totem on the table , when the Chaplain stepped on his right shoulder-blade .
Kim flinched under the leather , and , rolling sideways , brought down the Chaplain , who , ever a man of action , caught him by the throat and nearly choked the life out of him .
Kim then kicked him desperately in the stomach .
Mr Bennett gasped and doubled up , but without relaxing his grip , rolled over again , and silently hauled Kim to his own tent .
The Mavericks were incurable practical jokers ; and it occurred to the Englishman that silence was best till he had made complete inquiry .
` Why , it 's a boy ! '
he said , as he drew his prize under the light of the tent-pole lantern , then shaking him severely cried : ` What were you doing ?
You 're a thief .
Choor ?
Mallum ? '
His Hindustani was very limited , and the ruffled and disgusted Kim intended to keep to the character laid down for him .
As he recovered his breath he was inventing a beautifully plausible tale of his relations to some scullion , and at the same time keeping a keen eye on and a little under the Chaplain 's left arm-pit .
The chance came ; he ducked for the doorway , but a long arm shot out and clutched at his neck , snapping the amulet-string and closing on the amulet .
` Give it me .
O , give it me .
Is it lost ?
Give me the papers . '
The words were in English -- the tinny , saw-cut English of the native-bred , and the Chaplain jumped . '
A scapular , ' said he , opening his hand .
` No , some sort of heathen charm .
Why -- why , do you speak English ?
Little boys who steal are beaten .
You know that ? ' '
I do not -- I did not steal . '
Kim danced in agony like a terrier at a lifted stick .
` Oh , give it me .
It is my charm .
Do not thieve it from me . '
The Chaplain took no heed , but , going to the tent door , called aloud .
A fattish , clean-shaven man appeared . '
I want your advice , Father Victor , ' said Bennett . '
I found this boy in the dark outside the Mess-tent .
Ordinarily , I should have chastised him and let him go , because I believe him to be a thief .
But it seems he talks English , and he attaches some sort of value to a charm round his neck .
I thought perhaps you might help me . '
Between himself and the Roman Catholic Chaplain of the Irish contingent lay , as Bennett believed , an unbridgeable gulf , but it was noticeable that whenever the Church of England dealt with a human problem she was very likely to call in the Church of Rome .
Bennett 's official abhorrence of the Scarlet Woman and all her ways was only equalled by his private respect for Father Victor . '
A thief talking English , is it ?
Let 's look at his charm .
No , it 's not a scapular , Bennett . '
He held out his hand .
` But have we any right to open it ?
A sound whipping -- ' ' I did not thieve , ' protested Kim .
` You have hit me kicks all over my body .
Now give me my charm and I will go away . '
` Not quite so fast .
We 'll look first , ' said Father Victor , leisurely rolling out poor Kimball O'Hara 's ` ne varietur ' parchment , his clearance-certificate , and Kim 's baptismal certificate .
On this last O'Hara -- with some confused idea that he was doing wonders for his son -- had scrawled scores of times : ` Look after the boy .
Please look after the boy ' -- signing his name and regimental number in full .
` Powers of Darkness below ! '
said Father Victor , passing all over to Mr Bennett .
` Do you know what these things are ? '
` Yes . '
said Kim .
` They are mine , and I want to go away . ' '
I do not quite understand , ' said Mr Bennett .
` He probably brought them on purpose .
It may be a begging trick of some kind . ' '
I never saw a beggar less anxious to stay with his company , then .
There 's the makings of a gay mystery here .
Ye believe in Providence , Bennett ? ' '
I hope so . '
` Well , I believe in miracles , so it comes to the same thing .
Powers of Darkness !
Kimball O'Hara !
And his son !
But then he 's a native , and I saw Kimball married myself to Annie Shott .
How long have you had these things , boy ? '
` Ever since I was a little baby . '
Father Victor stepped forward quickly and opened the front of Kim 's upper garment .
` You see , Bennett , he 's not very black .
What 's your name ? '
` Kim . '
` Or Kimball ? '
` Perhaps .
Will you let me go away ? '
` What else ? '
` They call me Kim Rishti ke .
That is Kim of the Rishti . '
` What is that -- `` Rishti '' ? '
` Eye-rishti -- that was the Regiment -- my father 's . '
` Irish -- oh , I see . '
` Yess .
That was how my father told me .
My father , he has lived . '
` Has lived where ? '
` Has lived .
Of course he is dead -- gone-out . '
` Oh !
That 's your abrupt way of putting it , is it ? '
Bennett interrupted .
` It is possible I have done the boy an injustice .
He is certainly white , though evidently neglected .
I am sure I must have bruised him .
I do not think spirits -- ' ` Get him a glass of sherry , then , and let him squat on the cot .
Now , Kim , ' continued Father Victor , ` no one is going to hurt you .
Drink that down and tell us about yourself .
The truth , if you 've no objection . '
Kim coughed a little as he put down the empty glass , and considered .
This seemed a time for caution and fancy .
Small boys who prowl about camps are generally turned out after a whipping .
But he had received no stripes ; the amulet was evidently working in his favour , and it looked as though the Umballa horoscope and the few words that he could remember of his father 's maunderings fitted in most miraculously .
Else why did the fat padre seem so impressed , and why the glass of hot yellow drink from the lean one ?
` My father , he is dead in Lahore city since I was very little .
The woman , she kept kabarri shop near where the hire-carriages are . '
Kim began with a plunge , not quite sure how far the truth would serve him .
` Your mother ? '
` No ! '
-- with a gesture of disgust .
` She went out when I was born .
My father , he got these papers from the Jadoo-Gher what do you call that ? '
-LRB- Bennett nodded -RRB- ` because he was in good-standing .
What do you call that ? '
-LRB- again Bennett nodded -RRB- .
` My father told me that .
He said , too , and also the Brahmin who made the drawing in the dust at Umballa two days ago , he said , that I shall find a Red Bull on a green field and that the Bull shall help me . ' '
A phenomenal little liar , ' muttered Bennett .
` Powers of Darkness below , what a country ! '
murmured Father Victor .
` Go on , Kim . ' '
I did not thieve .
Besides , I am just now disciple of a very holy man .
He is sitting outside .
We saw two men come with flags , making the place ready .
That is always so in a dream , or on account of a -- a -- prophecy .
So I knew it was come true .
I saw the Red Bull on the green field , and my father he said : `` Nine hundred pukka devils and the Colonel riding on a horse will look after you when you find the Red Bull ! ''
I did not know what to do when I saw the Bull , but I went away and I came again when it was dark .
I wanted to see the Bull again , and I saw the Bull again with the -- the Sahibs praying to it .
I think the Bull shall help me .
The holy man said so too .
He is sitting outside .
Will you hurt him , if I call him a shout now ?
He is very holy .
He can witness to all the things I say , and he knows I am not a thief . ' '
`` Sahibs praying to a bull ! ''
What in the world do you make of that ? '
said Bennett . ''
` Disciple of a holy man ! ''
Is the boy mad ? '
` It 's O'Hara 's boy , sure enough .
O'Hara 's boy leagued with all the Powers of Darkness .
It 's very much what his father would have done if he was drunk .
We 'd better invite the holy man .
He may know something . '
` He does not know anything , ' said Kim . '
I will show you him if you come .
He is my master .
Then afterwards we can go . '
` Powers of Darkness ! '
was all that Father Victor could say , as Bennett marched off , with a firm hand on Kim 's shoulder .
They found the lama where he had dropped .
` The Search is at an end for me , ' shouted Kim in the vernacular . '
I have found the Bull , but God knows what comes next .
They will not hurt you .
Come to the fat priest 's tent with this thin man and see the end .
It is all new , and they can not talk Hindi .
They are only uncurried donkeys . '
` Then it is not well to make a jest of their ignorance , ' the lama returned . '
I am glad if thou art rejoiced , chela . '
Dignified and unsuspicious , he strode into the little tent , saluted the Churches as a Churchman , and sat down by the open charcoal brazier .
The yellow lining of the tent reflected in the lamplight made his face red-gold .
Bennett looked at him with the triple-ringed uninterest of the creed that lumps nine-tenths of the world under the title of ` heathen ' .
` And what was the end of the Search ?
What gift has the Red Bull brought ? '
The lama addressed himself to Kim .
` He says , `` What are you going to do ? '' '
Bennett was staring uneasily at Father Victor , and Kim , for his own ends , took upon himself the office of interpreter . '
I do not see what concern this fakir has with the boy , who is probably his dupe or his confederate , ' Bennett began .
` We can not allow an English boy -- Assuming that he is the son of a Mason , the sooner he goes to the Masonic Orphanage the better . '
` Ah !
That 's your opinion as Secretary to the Regimental Lodge , ' said Father Victor ; ` but we might as well tell the old man what we are going to do .
He does n't look like a villain . '
` My experience is that one can never fathom the Oriental mind .
Now , Kimball , I wish you to tell this man what I say word for word . '
Kim gathered the import of the next few sentences and began thus : ` Holy One , the thin fool who looks like a camel says that I am the son of a Sahib . '
` But how ? '
` Oh , it is true .
I knew it since my birth , but he could only find it out by rending the amulet from my neck and reading all the papers .
He thinks that once a Sahib is always a Sahib , and between the two of them they purpose to keep me in this Regiment or to send me to a madrissah -LSB- a school -RSB- .
It has happened before .
I have always avoided it .
The fat fool is of one mind and the camel-like one of another .
But that is no odds .
I may spend one night here and perhaps the next .
It has happened before .
Then I will run away and return to thee . '
` But tell them that thou art my chela .
Tell them how thou didst come to me when I was faint and bewildered .
Tell them of our Search , and they will surely let thee go now . ' '
I have already told them .
They laugh , and they talk of the police . '
` What are you saying ? '
asked Mr Bennett .
` Oah .
He only says that if you do not let me go it will stop him in his business -- his ur-gent private af-fairs . '
This last was a reminiscence of some talk with a Eurasian clerk in the Canal Department , but it only drew a smile , which nettled him .
` And if you did know what his business was you would not be in such a beastly hurry to interfere . '
` What is it then ? '
said Father Victor , not without feeling , as he watched the lama 's face .
` There is a River in this country which he wishes to find so verree much .
It was put out by an Arrow which -- ' Kim tapped his foot impatiently as he translated in his own mind from the vernacular to his clumsy English .
` Oah , it was made by our Lord God Buddha , you know , and if you wash there you are washed away from all your sins and made as white as cotton-wool . '
-LRB- Kim had heard mission-talk in his time . -RRB- '
I am his disciple , and we must find that River .
It is so verree valuable to us . '
` Say that again , ' said Bennett .
Kim obeyed , with amplifications .
` But this is gross blasphemy ! '
cried the Church of England .
` Tck !
Tck ! '
said Father Victor sympathetically .
` I 'd give a good deal to be able to talk the vernacular .
A river that washes away sin !
And how long have you two been looking for it ? '
` Oh , many days .
Now we wish to go away and look for it again .
It is not here , you see . ' '
I see , ' said Father Victor gravely .
` But he ca n't go on in that old man 's company .
It would be different , Kim , if you were not a soldier 's son .
Tell him that the Regiment will take care of you and make you as good a man as your -- as good a man as can be .
Tell him that if he believes in miracles he must believe that -- ' ` There is no need to play on his credulity , ' Bennett interrupted .
` I 'm doing no such thing .
He must believe that the boy 's coming here -- to his own Regiment -- in search of his Red Bull is in the nature of a miracle .
Consider the chances against it , Bennett .
This one boy in all India , and our Regiment of all others on the line o ' march for him to meet with !
It 's predestined on the face of it .
Yes , tell him it 's Kismet .
Kismet , mallum ?
-LSB- Do you understand ? -RSB- '
He turned towards the lama , to whom he might as well have talked of Mesopotamia .
` They say , ' -- the old man 's eye lighted at Kim 's speech ` they say that the meaning of my horoscope is now accomplished , and that being led back -- though as thou knowest I went out of curiosity -- to these people and their Red Bull I must needs go to a madrissah and be turned into a Sahib .
Now I make pretence of agreement , for at the worst it will be but a few meals eaten away from thee .
Then I will slip away and follow down the road to Saharunpore .
Therefore , Holy One , keep with that Kulu woman -- on no account stray far from her cart till I come again .
Past question , my sign is of War and of armed men .
See how they have given me wine to drink and set me upon a bed of honour !
My father must have been some great person .
So if they raise me to honour among them , good .
If not , good again .
However it goes , I will run back to thee when I am tired .
But stay with the Rajputni , or I shall miss thy feet ... Oah yess , ' said the boy , ' I have told him everything you tell me to say . '
` And I can not see any need why he should wait , ' said Bennett , feeling in his trouser-pocket .
` We can investigate the details later -- and I will give him a ru -- ' ` Give him time .
Maybe he 's fond of the lad , ' said Father Victor , half arresting the clergyman 's motion .
The lama dragged forth his rosary and pulled his huge hat-brim over his eyes .
` What can he want now ? '
` He says ' -- Kim put up one hand .
` He says : `` Be quiet . ''
He wants to speak to me by himself .
You see , you do not know one little word of what he says , and I think if you talk he will perhaps give you very bad curses .
When he takes those beads like that , you see , he always wants to be quiet . '
The two Englishmen sat overwhelmed , but there was a look in Bennett 's eye that promised ill for Kim when he should be relaxed to the religious arm . '
A Sahib and the son of a Sahib -- ' The lama 's voice was harsh with pain .
` But no white man knows the land and the customs of the land as thou knowest .
How comes it this is true ? '
` What matter , Holy One ?
-- but remember it is only for a night or two .
Remember , I can change swiftly .
It will all be as it was when I first spoke to thee under Zam-Zammah the great gun -- ' ` As a boy in the dress of white men -- when I first went to the Wonder House .
And a second time thou wast a Hindu .
What shall the third incarnation be ? '
He chuckled drearily .
` Ah , chela , thou has done a wrong to an old man because my heart went out to thee . '
` And mine to thee .
But how could I know that the Red Bull would bring me to this business ? '
The lama covered his face afresh , and nervously rattled the rosary .
Kim squatted beside him and laid hold upon a fold of his clothing .
` Now it is understood that the boy is a Sahib ? '
he went on in a muffled tone .
` Such a Sahib as was he who kept the images in the Wonder House . '
The lama 's experience of white men was limited .
He seemed to be repeating a lesson .
` So then it is not seemly that he should do other than as the Sahibs do .
He must go back to his own people . '
` For a day and a night and a day , ' Kim pleaded .
` No , ye do n't ! '
Father Victor saw Kim edging towards the door , and interposed a strong leg . '
I do not understand the customs of white men .
The Priest of the Images in the Wonder House in Lahore was more courteous than the thin one here .
This boy will be taken from me .
They will make a Sahib of my disciple ?
Woe to me !
How shall I find my River ?
Have they no disciples ?
Ask . '
` He says he is very sorree that he can not find the River now any more .
He says , Why have you no disciples , and stop bothering him ?
He wants to be washed of his sins . '
Neither Bennett nor Father Victor found any answer ready .
Said Kim in English , distressed for the lama 's agony : ' I think if you will let me go now we will walk away quietly and not steal .
We will look for that River like before I was caught .
I wish I did not come here to find the Red Bull and all that sort of thing .
I do not want it . '
` It 's the very best day 's work you ever did for yourself , young man , ' said Bennett .
` Good heavens , I do n't know how to console him , ' said Father Victor , watching the lama intently .
` He ca n't take the boy away with him , and yet he 's a good man -- I 'm sure he 's a good man .
Bennett , if you give him that rupee he 'll curse you root and branch ! '
They listened to each other 's breathing -- three -- five full minutes .
Then the lama raised his head , and looked forth across them into space and emptiness .
` And I am a Follower of the Way , ' he said bitterly .
` The sin is mine and the punishment is mine .
I made believe to myself for now I see it was but make-belief -- that thou wast sent to me to aid in the Search .
So my heart went out to thee for thy charity and thy courtesy and the wisdom of thy little years .
But those who follow the Way must permit not the fire of any desire or attachment , for that is all Illusion .
As says ... ' He quoted an old , old Chinese text , backed it with another , and reinforced these with a third . '
I stepped aside from the Way , my chela .
It was no fault of thine .
I delighted in the sight of life , the new people upon the roads , and in thy joy at seeing these things .
I was pleased with thee who should have considered my Search and my Search alone .
Now I am sorrowful because thou art taken away and my River is far from me .
It is the Law which I have broken ! '
` Powers of Darkness below ! '
said Father Victor , who , wise in the confessional , heard the pain in every sentence . '
I see now that the sign of the Red Bull was a sign for me as well as for thee .
All Desire is red -- and evil .
I will do penance and find my River alone . '
` At least go back to the Kulu woman , ' said Kim , ` otherwise thou wilt be lost upon the roads .
She will feed thee till I run back to thee . '
The lama waved a hand to show that the matter was finally settled in his mind .
` Now , ' -- his tone altered as he turned to Kim , -- ` what will they do with thee ?
At least I may , acquiring merit , wipe out past ill . '
` Make me a Sahib -- so they think .
The day after tomorrow I return .
Do not grieve . '
` Of what sort ?
Such an one as this or that man ? '
He pointed to Father Victor .
` Such an one as those I saw this evening , men wearing swords and stamping heavily ? '
` Maybe . '
` That is not well .
These men follow desire and come to emptiness .
Thou must not be of their sort . '
` The Umballa priest said that my Star was War , ' Kim interjected . '
I will ask these fools -- but there is truly no need .
I will run away this night , for all I wanted to see the new things . '
Kim put two or three questions in English to Father Victor , translating the replies to the lama .
Then : ` He says , `` You take him from me and you can not say what you will make him . ''
He says , `` Tell me before I go , for it is not a small thing to make a child . '' '
` You will be sent to a school .
Later on , we shall see .
Kimball , I suppose you 'd like to be a soldier ? '
` Gorah-log -LSB- white-folk -RSB- .
No-ah !
No-ah ! '
Kim shook his head violently .
There was nothing in his composition to which drill and routine appealed . '
I will not be a soldier . '
` You will be what you 're told to be , ' said Bennett ; ` and you should be grateful that we 're going to help you . '
Kim smiled compassionately .
If these men lay under the delusion that he would do anything that he did not fancy , so much the better .
Another long silence followed .
Bennett fidgeted with impatience , and suggested calling a sentry to evict the fakir .
` Do they give or sell learning among the Sahibs ?
Ask them , ' said the lama , and Kim interpreted .
` They say that money is paid to the teacher -- but that money the Regiment will give ... What need ?
It is only for a night . '
` And -- the more money is paid the better learning is given ? '
The lama disregarded Kim 's plans for an early flight .
` It is no wrong to pay for learning .
To help the ignorant to wisdom is always a merit . '
The rosary clicked furiously as an abacus .
Then he faced his oppressors .
` Ask them for how much money do they give a wise and suitable teaching ?
And in what city is that teaching given ? '
` Well , ' said Father Victor in English , when Kim had translated , ` that depends .
The Regiment would pay for you all the time you are at the Military Orphanage ; or you might go on the Punjab Masonic Orphanage 's list -LRB- not that he or you ` ud understand what that means -RRB- ; but the best schooling a boy can get in India is , of course , at St Xavier 's in Partibus at Lucknow . '
This took some time to interpret , for Bennett wished to cut it short .
` He wants to know how much ? '
said Kim placidly .
` Two or three hundred rupees a year . '
Father Victor was long past any sense of amazement .
Bennett , impatient , did not understand .
` He says : `` Write that name and the money upon a paper and give it him . ''
And he says you must write your name below , because he is going to write a letter in some days to you .
He says you are a good man .
He says the other man is a fool .
He is going away . '
The lama rose suddenly . '
I follow my Search , ' he cried , and was gone .
` He 'll run slap into the sentries , ' cried Father Victor , jumping up as the lama stalked out ; ` but I ca n't leave the boy . '
Kim made swift motion to follow , but checked himself .
There was no sound of challenge outside .
The lama had disappeared .
Kim settled himself composedly on the Chaplain 's cot .
At least the lama had promised that he would stay with the Raiput woman from Kulu , and the rest was of the smallest importance .
It pleased him that the two padres were so evidently excited .
They talked long in undertones , Father Victor urging some scheme on Mr Bennett , who seemed incredulous .
All this was very new and fascinating , but Kim felt sleepy .
They called men into the tent -- one of them certainly was the Colonel , as his father had prophesied -- and they asked him an infinity of questions , chiefly about the woman who looked after him , all of which Kim answered truthfully .
They did not seem to think the woman a good guardian .
After all , this was the newest of his experiences .
Sooner or later , if he chose , he could escape into great , grey , formless India , beyond tents and padres and colonels .
Meantime , if the Sahibs were to be impressed , he would do his best to impress them .
He too was a white man .
After much talk that he could not comprehend , they handed him over to a sergeant , who had strict instructions not to let him escape .
The Regiment would go on to Umballa , and Kim would be sent up , partly at the expense of the Lodge and in part by subscription , to a place called Sanawar .
` It 's miraculous past all whooping , Colonel , ' said Father Victor , when he had talked without a break for ten minutes .
` His Buddhist friend has levanted after taking my name and address .
I ca n't quite make out whether he 'll pay for the boy 's education or whether he is preparing some sort of witchcraft on his own account . '
Then to Kim : ` You 'll live to be grateful to your friend the Red Bull yet .
We 'll make a man of you at Sanawar -- even at the price o ' making you a Protestant . '
` Certainly -- most certainly , ' said Bennett .
` But you will not go to Sanawar , ' said Kim .
` But we will go to Sanawar , little man .
That 's the order of the Commander-in-Chief , who 's a trifle more important than O'Hara 's son . '
` You will not go to Sanawar .
You will go to thee War . '
There was a shout of laughter from the full tent .
` When you know your own Regiment a trifle better you wo n't confuse the line of march with line of battle , Kim .
We hope to go to `` thee War '' sometime . '
` Oah , I know all thatt . '
Kim drew his bow again at a venture .
If they were not going to the war , at least they did not know what he knew of the talk in the veranda at Umballa . '
I know you are not at thee war now ; but I tell you that as soon as you get to Umballa you will be sent to the war -- the new war .
It is a war of eight thousand men , besides the guns . '
` That 's explicit .
D'you add prophecy to your other gifts ?
Take him along , sergeant .
Take up a suit for him from the Drums , an ' take care he does n't slip through your fingers .
Who says the age of miracles is gone by ?
I think I 'll go to bed .
My poor mind 's weakening . '
At the far end of the camp , silent as a wild animal , an hour later sat Kim , newly washed all over , in a horrible stiff suit that rasped his arms and legs . '
A most amazin ' young bird , ' said the sergeant .
` He turns up in charge of a yellow-headed buck-Brahmin priest , with his father 's Lodge certificates round his neck , talkin ' God knows what all of a red bull .
The buck-Brahmin evaporates without explanations , an ' the bhoy sets cross-legged on the Chaplain 's bed prophesyin ' bloody war to the men at large .
Injia 's a wild land for a God-fearin ' man .
I 'll just tie his leg to the tent-pole in case he 'll go through the roof .
What did ye say about the war ? '
` Eight thousand men , besides guns , ' said Kim .
` Very soon you will see . '
` You 're a consolin ' little imp .
Lie down between the Drums an ' go to bye-bye .
Those two boys will watch your slumbers . '
Chapter 6 Now I remember comrades -- Old playmates on new seas -- Whenas we traded orpiment Among the savages .
Ten thousand leagues to southward , And thirty years removed -- They knew not noble Valdez , But me they knew and loved .
Song of Diego Valdez .
Very early in the morning the white tents came down and disappeared as the Mavericks took a side-road to Umballa .
It did not skirt the resting-place , and Kim , trudging beside a baggage-cart under fire of comments from soldiers ' wives , was not so confident as overnight .
He discovered that he was closely watched -- Father Victor on the one side , and Mr Bennett on the other .
In the forenoon the column checked .
A camel-orderly handed the Colonel a letter .
He read it , and spoke to a Major .
Half a mile in the rear , Kim heard a hoarse and joyful clamour rolling down on him through the thick dust .
Then someone beat him on the back , crying : ` Tell us how ye knew , ye little limb of Satan ?
Father dear , see if ye can make him tell . '
A pony ranged alongside , and he was hauled on to the priest 's saddlebow .
` Now , my son , your prophecy of last night has come true .
Our orders are to entrain at Umballa for the Front tomorrow . '
` What is thatt ? '
said Kim , for ` front ' and ` entrain ' were newish words to him .
` We are going to `` thee War , '' as you called it . '
` Of course you are going to thee War .
I said last night . '
` Ye did ; but , Powers o ' Darkness , how did ye know ? '
Kim 's eyes sparkled .
He shut his lips , nodded his head , and looked unspeakable things .
The Chaplain moved on through the dust , and privates , sergeants , and subalterns called one another 's attention to the boy .
The Colonel , at the head of the column , stared at him curiously .
` It was probably some bazar rumour . '
he said ; ` but even then -- ' He referred to the paper in his hand .
` Hang it all , the thing was only decided within the last forty-eight hours . '
` Are there many more like you in India ? '
said Father Victor , ` or are you by way o ' being a lusus naturae ? '
` Now I have told you , ' said the boy , ` will you let me go back to my old man ?
If he has not stayed with that woman from Kulu , I am afraid he will die . '
` By what I saw of him he 's as well able to take care of himself as you .
No .
Ye 've brought us luck , an ' we 're goin ' to make a man of you .
I 'll take ye back to your baggage-cart and ye 'll come to me this evening . '
For the rest of the day Kim found himself an object of distinguished consideration among a few hundred white men .
The story of his appearance in camp , the discovery of his parentage , and his prophecy , had lost nothing in the telling .
A big , shapeless white woman on a pile of bedding asked him mysteriously whether he thought her husband would come back from the war .
Kim reflected gravely , and said that he would , and the woman gave him food .
In many respects , this big procession that played music at intervals -- this crowd that talked and laughed so easily -- resembled a festival in Lahore city .
So far , there was no sign of hard work , and he resolved to lend the spectacle his patronage .
At evening there came out to meet them bands of music , and played the Mavericks into camp near Umballa railway station .
That was an interesting night .
Men of other regiments came to visit the Mavericks .
The Mavericks went visiting on their own account .
Their pickets hurried forth to bring them back , met pickets of strange regiments on the same duty ; and , after a while , the bugles blew madly for more pickets with officers to control the tumult .
The Mavericks had a reputation for liveliness to live up to .
But they fell in on the platform next morning in perfect shape and condition ; and Kim , left behind with the sick , women , and boys , found himself shouting farewells excitedly as the trains drew away .
Life as a Sahib was amusing so far ; but he touched it with a cautious hand .
Then they marched him back in charge of a drummer-boy to empty , lime-washed barracks , whose floors were covered with rubbish and string and paper , and whose ceilings gave back his lonely footfall .
Native-fashion , he curled himself up on a stripped cot and went to sleep .
An angry man stumped down the veranda , woke him up , and said he was a schoolmaster .
This was enough for Kim , and he retired into his shell .
He could just puzzle out the various English Police notices in Lahore city , because they affected his comfort ; and among the many guests of the woman who looked after him had been a queer German who painted scenery for the Parsee travelling theatre .
He told Kim that he had been ` on the barricades in ` Forty-eight , ' and therefore -- at least that was how it struck Kim -- he would teach the boy to write in return for food .
Kim had been kicked as far as single letters , but did not think well of them . '
I do not know anything .
Go away ! '
said Kim , scenting evil .
Hereupon the man caught him by the ear , dragged him to a room in a far-off wing where a dozen drummer-boys were sitting on forms , and told him to be still if he could do nothing else .
This he managed very successfully .
The man explained something or other with white lines on a black board for at least half an hour , and Kim continued his interrupted nap .
He much disapproved of the present aspect of affairs , for this was the very school and discipline he had spent two-thirds of his young life in avoiding .
Suddenly a beautiful idea occurred to him , and he wondered that he had not thought of it before .
The man dismissed them , and first to spring through the veranda into the open sunshine was Kim . ''
Ere , you !
` Alt !
Stop ! '
said a high voice at his heels .
` I 've got to look after you .
My orders are not to let you out of my sight .
Where are you goin ' ? '
It was the drummer-boy who had been hanging round him all the forenoon -- a fat and freckled person of about fourteen , and Kim loathed him from the soles of his boots to his cap-ribbons .
` To the bazar -- to get sweets -- for you , ' said Kim , after thought .
` Well , the bazar 's out o ' bounds .
If we go there we 'll get a dressing-down .
You come back . '
` How near can we go ? '
Kim did not know what bounds meant , but he wished to be polite -- for the present . ''
Ow near ?
` Ow far , you mean !
We can go as far as that tree down the road . '
` Then I will go there . '
` All right .
I ai n't goin ' .
It 's too ` ot .
I can watch you from ` ere .
It 's no good your runnin ' away .
If you did , they 'd spot you by your clothes .
That 's regimental stuff you 're wearin ' .
There ai n't a picket in Umballa would n't ` ead you back quicker than you started out . '
This did not impress Kim as much as the knowledge that his raiment would tire him out if he tried to run .
He slouched to the tree at the corner of a bare road leading towards the bazar , and eyed the natives passing .
Most of them were barrack-servants of the lowest caste .
Kim hailed a sweeper , who promptly retorted with a piece of unnecessary insolence , in the natural belief that the European boy could not follow it .
The low , quick answer undeceived him .
Kim put his fettered soul into it , thankful for the late chance to abuse somebody in the tongue he knew best .
` And now , go to the nearest letter-writer in the bazar and tell him to come here .
I would write a letter . '
` But -- but what manner of white man 's son art thou to need a bazar letter-writer ?
Is there not a schoolmaster in the barracks ? '
` Ay ; and Hell is full of the same sort .
Do my order , you -- you Od !
Thy mother was married under a basket !
Servant of Lal Beg ' -LRB- Kim knew the God of the sweepers -RRB- , ` run on my business or we will talk again . '
The sweeper shuffled off in haste .
` There is a white boy by the barracks waiting under a tree who is not a white boy , ' he stammered to the first bazar letter-writer he came across .
` He needs thee . '
` Will he pay ? '
said the spruce scribe , gathering up his desk and pens and sealing-wax all in order . '
I do not know .
He is not like other boys .
Go and see .
It is well worth . '
Kim danced with impatience when the slim young Kayeth hove in sight .
As soon as his voice could carry he cursed him volubly .
` First I will take my pay , ' the letter-writer said .
` Bad words have made the price higher .
But who art thou , dressed in that fashion , to speak in this fashion ? '
` Aha !
That is in the letter which thou shalt write .
Never was such a tale .
But I am in no haste .
Another writer will serve me .
Umballa city is as full of them as is Lahore . '
` Four annas , ' said the writer , sitting down and spreading his cloth in the shade of a deserted barrack-wing .
Mechanically Kim squatted beside him -- squatted as only the natives can -- in spite of the abominable clinging trousers .
The writer regarded him sideways .
` That is the price to ask of Sahibs , ' said Kim .
` Now fix me a true one . '
` An anna and a half .
How do I know , having written the letter , that thou wilt not run away ? '
I must not go beyond this tree , and there is also the stamp to be considered . ' '
I get no commission on the price of the stamp .
Once more , what manner of white boy art thou ? '
` That shall be said in the letter , which is to Mahbub Ali , the horse-dealer in the Kashmir Serai , at Lahore .
He is my friend . '
` Wonder on wonder ! '
murmured the letter-writer , dipping a reed in the inkstand .
` To be written in Hindi ? '
` Assuredly .
To Mahbub Ali then .
Begin !
I have come down with the old man as far as Umballa in the train .
At Umballa I carried the news of the bay mare 's pedigree . '
After what he had seen in the garden , he was not going to write of white stallions .
` Slower a little .
What has a bay mare to do ... Is it Mahbub Ali , the great dealer ? '
` Who else ?
I have been in his service .
Take more ink .
Again .
As the order was , so I did it .
We then went on foot towards Benares , but on the third day we found a certain regiment .
Is that down ? '
` Ay , pulton , ' murmured the writer , all ears . '
I went into their camp and was caught , and by means of the charm about my neck , which thou knowest , it was established that I was the son of some man in the regiment : according to the prophecy of the Red Bull , which thou knowest was common talk of our bazar . '
Kim waited for this shaft to sink into the letter-writer 's heart , cleared his throat , and continued : ' A priest clothed me and gave me a new name ... One priest , however , was a fool .
The clothes are very heavy , but I am a Sahib and my heart is heavy too .
They send me to a school and beat me .
I do not like the air and water here .
Come then and help me , Mahbub Ali , or send me some money , for I have not sufficient to pay the writer who writes this . ' '
`` Who writes this . ''
It is my own fault that I was tricked .
Thou art as clever as Husain Bux that forged the Treasury stamps at Nucklao .
But what a tale !
What a tale !
Is it true by any chance ? '
` It does not profit to tell lies to Mahbub Ali .
It is better to help his friends by lending them a stamp .
When the money comes I will repay . '
The writer grunted doubtfully , but took a stamp out of his desk , sealed the letter , handed it over to Kim , and departed .
Mahbub Ali 's was a name of power in Umballa .
` That is the way to win a good account with the Gods , ' Kim shouted after him .
` Pay me twice over when the money comes , ' the man cried over his shoulder .
` What was you bukkin ' to that nigger about ? '
said the drummer-boy when Kim returned to the veranda . '
I was watch-in ' you . ' '
I was only talkin ' to him . '
` You talk the same as a nigger , do n't you ? '
` No-ah !
No-ah !
I onlee speak a little .
What shall we do now ? '
` The bugles 'll go for dinner in arf a minute .
My Gawd !
I wish I 'd gone up to the Front with the Regiment .
It 's awful doin ' nothin ' but school down ` ere .
Do n't you ` ate it ? '
` Oah yess ! '
I 'd run away if I knew where to go to , but , as the men say , in this bloomin ' Injia you 're only a prisoner at large .
You ca n't desert without bein ' took back at once .
I 'm fair sick of it . '
` You have been in Be -- England ? '
` W ` y , I only come out last troopin ' season with my mother .
I should think I ` ave been in England .
What a ignorant little beggar you are !
You was brought up in the gutter , was n't you ? '
` Oah yess .
Tell me something about England .
My father he came from there . '
Though he would not say so , Kim of course disbelieved every word the drummer-boy spoke about the Liverpool suburb which was his England .
It passed the heavy time till dinner -- a most unappetizing meal served to the boys and a few invalids in a corner of a barrack-room .
But that he had written to Mahbub Ali , Kim would have been almost depressed .
The indifference of native crowds he was used to ; but this strong loneliness among white men preyed on him .
He was grateful when , in the course of the afternoon , a big soldier took him over to Father Victor , who lived in another wing across another dusty parade-ground .
The priest was reading an English letter written in purple ink .
He looked at Kim more curiously than ever .
` An ' how do you like it , my son , as far as you 've gone ?
Not much , eh ?
It must be hard -- very hard on a wild animal .
Listen now .
I 've an amazin ' epistle from your friend . '
` Where is he ?
Is he well ?
Oah !
If he knows to write me letters , it is all right . '
` You 're fond of him then ? '
` Of course I am fond of him .
He was fond of me . '
` It seems so by the look of this .
He ca n't write English , can he ? '
` Oah no .
Not that I know , but of course he found a letter-writer who can write English verree well , and so he wrote .
I do hope you understand . '
` That accounts for it .
D'you know anything about his money affairs ? '
Kim 's face showed that he did not .
` How can I tell ? '
` That 's what I 'm askin ' .
Now listen if you can make head or tail o ' this .
We 'll skip the first part ... It 's written from Jagadhir Road ... `` Sitting on wayside in grave meditation , trusting to be favoured with your Honour 's applause of present step , which recommend your Honour to execute for Almighty God 's sake .
Education is greatest blessing if of best sorts .
Otherwise no earthly use . ''
Faith , the old man 's hit the bull 's - eye that time !
`` If your Honour condescending giving my boy best educations Xavier '' -LRB- I suppose that 's St Xavier 's in Partibus -RRB- `` in terms of our conversation dated in your tent 15th instant '' -LRB- a business-like touch there ! -RRB-
`` then Almighty God blessing your Honour 's succeedings to third an ' fourth generation and '' -- now listen !
-- `` confide in your Honour 's humble servant for adequate remuneration per hoondi per annum three hundred rupees a year to one expensive education St Xavier , Lucknow , and allow small time to forward same per hoondi sent to any part of India as your Honour shall address yourself .
This servant of your Honour has presently no place to lay crown of his head , but going to Benares by train on account of persecution of old woman talking so much and unanxious residing Saharunpore in any domestic capacity . ''
Now what in the world does that mean ? '
` She has asked him to be her puro -- her clergyman -- at Saharunpore , I think .
He would not do that on account of his River .
She did talk . '
` It 's clear to you , is it ?
It beats me altogether .
`` So going to Benares , where will find address and forward rupees for boy who is apple of eye , and for Almighty God 's sake execute this education , and your petitioner as in duty bound shall ever awfully pray .
Written by Sobrao Satai , Failed Entrance Allahabad University , for Venerable Teshoo Lama the priest of Such-zen looking for a River , address care of Tirthankars ' Temple , Benares .
P. M. -- Please note boy is apple of eye , and rupees shall be sent per hoondi three hundred per annum .
For God Almighty 's sake . ''
Now , is that ravin ' lunacy or a business proposition ?
I ask you , because I 'm fairly at my wits ' end . '
` He says he will give me three hundred rupees a year ?
So he will give me them . '
` Oh , that 's the way you look at it , is it ? '
` Of course .
If he says so ! '
The priest whistled ; then he addressed Kim as an equal . '
I do n't believe it ; but we 'll see .
You were goin ' off today to the Military Orphanage at Sanawar , where the Regiment would keep you till you were old enough to enlist .
Ye 'd be brought up to the Church of England .
Bennett arranged for that .
On the other hand , if ye go to St Xavier 's ye 'll get a better education an -- an can have the religion .
D'ye see my dilemma ?
Kim saw nothing save a vision of the lama going south in a train with none to beg for him .
` Like most people , I 'm going to temporize .
If your friend sends the money from Benares -- Powers of Darkness below , where 's a street-beggar to raise three hundred rupees ?
-- ye 'll go down to Lucknow and I 'll pay your fare , because I ca n't touch the subscription-money if I intend , as I do , to make ye a Catholic .
If he does n't , ye 'll go to the Military Orphanage at the Regiment 's expense .
I 'll allow him three days ' grace , though I do n't believe it at all .
Even then , if he fails in his payments later on ... but it 's beyond me .
We can only walk one step at a time in this world , praise God !
An ' they sent Bennett to the Front an ' left me behind .
Bennett ca n't expect everything . '
` Oah yess , ' said Kim vaguely .
The priest leaned forward .
` I 'd give a month 's pay to find what 's goin ' on inside that little round head of yours . '
` There is nothing , ' said Kim , and scratched it .
He was wondering whether Mahbub Ali would send him as much as a whole rupee .
Then he could pay the letter-writer and write letters to the lama at Benares .
Perhaps Mahbub Ali would visit him next time he came south with horses .
Surely he must know that Kim 's delivery of the letter to the officer at Umballa had caused the great war which the men and boys had discussed so loudly over the barrack dinner-tables .
But if Mahbub Ali did not know this , it would be very unsafe to tell him so .
Mahbub Ali was hard upon boys who knew , or thought they knew , too much .
` Well , till I get further news ' -- Father Victor 's voice interrupted the reverie .
` Ye can run along now and play with the other boys .
They 'll teach ye something -- but I do n't think ye 'll like it . '
The day dragged to its weary end .
When he wished to sleep he was instructed how to fold up his clothes and set out his boots ; the other boys deriding .
Bugles waked him in the dawn ; the schoolmaster caught him after breakfast , thrust a page of meaningless characters under his nose , gave them senseless names and whacked him without reason .
Kim meditated poisoning him with opium borrowed from a barrack-sweeper , but reflected that , as they all ate at one table in public -LRB- this was peculiarly revolting to Kim , who preferred to turn his back on the world at meals -RRB- , the stroke might be dangerous .
Then he attempted running off to the village where the priest had tried to drug the lama -- the village where the old soldier lived .
But far-seeing sentries at every exit headed back the little scarlet figure .
Trousers and jacket crippled body and mind alike so he abandoned the project and fell back , Oriental-fashion , on time and chance .
Three days of torment passed in the big , echoing white rooms .
He walked out of afternoons under escort of the drummer-boy , and all he heard from his companions were the few useless words which seemed to make two-thirds of the white man 's abuse .
Kim knew and despised them all long ago .
The boy resented his silence and lack of interest by beating him , as was only natural .
He did not care for any of the bazars which were in bounds .
He styled all natives ` niggers ' ; yet servants and sweepers called him abominable names to his face , and , misled by their deferential attitude , he never understood .
This somewhat consoled Kim for the beatings .
On the morning of the fourth day a judgement overtook that drummer .
They had gone out together towards Umballa racecourse .
He returned alone , weeping , with news that young O'Hara , to whom he had been doing nothing in particular , had hailed a scarlet-bearded nigger on horseback ; that the nigger had then and there laid into him with a peculiarly adhesive quirt , picked up young O'Hara , and borne him off at full gallop .
These tidings came to Father Victor , and he drew down his long upper lip .
He was already sufficiently startled by a letter from the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares , enclosing a native banker 's note of hand for three hundred rupees , and an amazing prayer to ` Almighty God ' .
The lama would have been more annoyed than the priest had he known how the bazar letter-writer had translated his phrase ` to acquire merit . '
` Powers of Darkness below ! '
Father Victor fumbled with the note .
` An ' now he 's off with another of his peep-o ' - day friends .
I do n't know whether it will be a greater relief to me to get him back or to have him lost .
He 's beyond my comprehension .
How the Divil -- yes , he 's the man I mean -- can a street-beggar raise money to educate white boys ? '
Three miles off , on Umballa racecourse , Mahbub Ali , reining a grey Kabuli stallion with Kim in front of him , was saying : ` But , Little Friend of all the World , there is my honour and reputation to be considered .
All the officer-Sahibs in all the regiments , and all Umballa , know Mahbub Ali .
Men saw me pick thee up and chastise that boy .
We are seen now from far across this plain .
How can I take thee away , or account for thy disappearing if I set thee down and let thee run off into the crops ?
They would put me in jail .
Be patient .
Once a Sahib , always a Sahib .
When thou art a man -- who knows ?
-- thou wilt be grateful to Mahbub Ali . '
` Take me beyond their sentries where I can change this red .
Give me money and I will go to Benares and be with my lama again .
I do not want to be a Sahib , and remember I did deliver that message . '
The stallion bounded wildly .
Mahbub Ali had incautiously driven home the sharp-edged stirrup .
-LRB- He was not the new sort of fluent horse-dealer who wears English boots and spurs . -RRB-
Kim drew his own conclusions from that betrayal .
` That was a small matter .
It lay on the straight road to Benares .
I and the Sahib have by this time forgotten it .
I send so many letters and messages to men who ask questions about horses , I can not well remember one from the other .
Was it some matter of a bay mare that Peters Sahib wished the pedigree of ? '
Kim saw the trap at once .
If he had said ` bay mare ' Mahbub would have known by his very readiness to fall in with the amendment that the boy suspected something .
Kim replied therefore : ` Bay mare .
No .
I do not forget my messages thus .
It was a white stallion . '
` Ay , so it was .
A white Arab stallion .
But thou didst write `` bay mare '' to me . '
` Who cares to tell truth to a letter-writer ? '
Kim answered , feeling Mahbub 's palm on his heart .
` Hi !
Mahbub , you old villain , pull up ! '
cried a voice , and an Englishman raced alongside on a little polo-pony .
` I 've been chasing you half over the country .
That Kabuli of yours can go .
For sale , I suppose ? ' '
I have some young stuff coming on made by Heaven for the delicate and difficult polo-game .
He has no equal .
He -- ' ` Plays polo and waits at table .
Yes .
We know all that .
What the deuce have you got there ? '
` A. boy , ' said Mahbub gravely .
` He was being beaten by another boy .
His father was once a white soldier in the big war .
The boy was a child in Lahore city .
He played with my horses when he was a babe .
Now I think they will make him a soldier .
He has been newly caught by his father 's Regiment that went up to the war last week .
But I do not think he wants to be a soldier .
I take him for a ride .
Tell me where thy barracks are and I will set thee there . '
` Let me go .
I can find the barracks alone . '
` And if thou runnest away who will say it is not my fault ? '
` He 'll run back to his dinner .
Where has he to run to ? '
the Englishman asked .
` He was born in the land .
He has friends .
He goes where he chooses .
He is a chabuk sawai -LSB- a sharp chap -RSB- .
It needs only to change his clothing , and in a twinkling he would be a low-caste Hindu boy . '
` The deuce he would ! '
The Englishman looked critically at the boy as Mahbub headed towards the barracks .
Kim ground his teeth .
Mahbub was mocking him , as faithless Afghans will ; for he went on : ` They will send him to a school and put heavy boots on his feet and swaddle him in these clothes .
Then he will forget all he knows .
Now , which of the barracks is thine ? '
Kim pointed -- he could not speak -- to Father Victor 's wing , all staring white near by .
` Perhaps he will make a good soldier , ' said Mahbub reflectively .
` He will make a good orderly at least .
I sent him to deliver a message once from Lahore .
A message concerning the pedigree of a white stallion . '
Here was deadly insult on deadlier injury -- and the Sahib to whom he had so craftily given that war-waking letter heard it all .
Kim beheld Mahbub Ali frying in flame for his treachery , but for himself he saw one long grey vista of barracks , schools , and barracks again .
He gazed imploringly at the clear-cut face in which there was no glimmer of recognition ; but even at this extremity it never occurred to him to throw himself on the white man 's mercy or to denounce the Afghan .
And Mahbub stared deliberately at the Englishman , who stared as deliberately at Kim , quivering and tongue-tied .
` My horse is well trained , ' said the dealer .
` Others would have kicked , Sahib . '
` Ah , ' said the Englishman at last , rubbing his pony 's damp withers with his whip-butt .
` Who makes the boy a soldier ? '
` He says the Regiment that found him , and especially the Padre-sahib of that regiment .
` There is the Padre ! '
Kim choked as bare-headed Father Victor sailed down upon them from the veranda .
` Powers O ' Darkness below , O'Hara !
How many more mixed friends do you keep in Asia ? '
he cried , as Kim slid down and stood helplessly before him .
` Good morning , Padre , ' the Englishman said cheerily . '
I know you by reputation well enough .
Meant to have come over and called before this .
I 'm Creighton . '
` Of the Ethnological Survey ? '
said Father Victor .
The Englishman nodded .
` Faith , I 'm glad to meet ye then ; an ' I owe you some thanks for bringing back the boy . '
` No thanks to me , Padre .
Besides , the boy was n't going away .
You do n't know old Mahbub Ali . '
The horse-dealer sat impassive in the sunlight .
` You will when you have been in the station a month .
He sells us all our crocks .
That boy is rather a curiosity .
Can you tell me anything about him ? '
` Can I tell you ? '
puffed Father Victor .
` You 'll be the one man that could help me in my quandaries .
Tell you !
Powers o ' Darkness , I 'm bursting to tell someone who knows something o ' the native ! '
A groom came round the corner .
Colonel Creighton raised his voice , speaking in Urdu .
` Very good , Mahbub Ali , but what is the use of telling me all those stories about the pony ?
Not one pice more than three hundred and fifty rupees will I give . '
` The Sahib is a little hot and angry after riding , ' the horse-dealer returned , with the leer of a privileged jester .
` Presently , he will see my horse 's points more clearly .
I will wait till he has finished his talk with the Padre .
I will wait under that tree . '
` Confound you ! '
The Colonel laughed .
` That comes of looking at one of Mahbub 's horses .
He 's a regular old leech , Padre .
Wait , then , if thou hast so much time to spare , Mahbub .
Now I 'm at your service , Padre .
Where is the boy ?
Oh , he 's gone off to collogue with Mahbub .
Queer sort of boy .
Might I ask you to send my mare round under cover ? '
He dropped into a chair which commanded a clear view of Kim and Mahbub Ali in conference beneath the tree .
The Padre went indoors for cheroots .
Creighton heard Kim say bitterly : ` Trust a Brahmin before a snake , and a snake before an harlot , and an harlot before a Pathan , Mahbub Ali . '
` That is all one . '
The great red beard wagged solemnly .
` Children should not see a carpet on the loom till the pattern is made plain .
Believe me , Friend of all the World , I do thee great service .
They will not make a soldier of thee . '
` You crafty old sinner ! '
thought Creighton .
` But you 're not far wrong .
That boy must n't be wasted if he is as advertised . '
` Excuse me half a minute , ' cried the Padre from within , ` but I 'm gettin ' the documents in the case . '
` If through me the favour of this bold and wise Colonel Sahib comes to thee , and thou art raised to honour , what thanks wilt thou give Mahbub Ali when thou art a man ? '
` Nay , nay !
I begged thee to let me take the Road again , where I should have been safe ; and thou hast sold me back to the English .
What will they give thee for blood-money ? ' '
A cheerful young demon ! '
The Colonel bit his cigar , and turned politely to Father Victor .
` What are the letters that the fat priest is waving before the Colonel ?
Stand behind the stallion as though looking at my bridle ! '
said Mahbub Ali . '
A letter from my lama which he wrote from Jagadhir Road , saying that he will pay three hundred rupees by the year for my schooling . '
` Oho !
Is old Red Hat of that sort ?
At which school ? '
` God knows .
I think in Nucklao . '
` Yes .
There is a big school there for the sons of Sahibs -- and half-Sahibs .
I have seen it when I sell horses there .
So the lama also loved the Friend of all the World ? '
` Ay ; and he did not tell lies , or return me to captivity . '
` Small wonder the Padre does not know how to unravel the thread .
How fast he talks to the Colonel Sahib ! '
Mahbub Ali chuckled .
` By Allah ! '
the keen eyes swept the veranda for an Instant -- ` thy lama has sent what to me looks like a note of hand .
I have had some few dealings in hoondis .
The Colonel Sahib is looking at it . '
` What good is all this to me ? '
said Kim wearily .
` Thou wilt go away , and they will return me to those empty rooms where there is no good place to sleep and where the boys beat me . ' '
I do not think that .
Have patience , child .
All Pathans are not faithless -- except in horseflesh . '
Five -- ten -- fifteen minutes passed , Father Victor talking energetically or asking questions which the Colonel answered .
` Now I 've told you everything that I know about the boy from beginnin to end ; and it 's a blessed relief to me .
Did ye ever hear the like ? '
` At any rate , the old man has sent the money .
Gobind Sahai 's notes of hand are good from here to China , ' said the Colonel .
` The more one knows about natives the less can one say what they will or wo n't do . '
` That 's consolin ' -- from the head of the Ethnological Survey .
It 's this mixture of Red Bulls and Rivers of Healing -LRB- poor heathen , God help him ! -RRB-
an ' notes of hand and Masonic certificates .
Are you a Mason , by any chance ? '
` By Jove , I am , now I come to think of it .
That 's an additional reason , ' said the Colonel absently .
` I 'm glad ye see a reason in it .
But as I said , it 's the mixture o ' things that 's beyond me .
An ' his prophesyin ' to our Colonel , sitting on my bed with his little shimmy torn open showing his white skin ; an ' the prophecy comin ' true !
They 'll cure all that nonsense at St Xavier 's , eh ? '
` Sprinkle him with holy water , ' the Colonel laughed .
` On my word , I fancy I ought to sometimes .
But I 'm hoping he 'll be brought up as a good Catholic .
All that troubles me is what 'll happen if the old beggar-man -- ' ` Lama , lama , my dear sir ; and some of them are gentlemen in their own country . '
` The lama , then , fails to pay next year .
He 's a fine business head to plan on the spur of the moment , but he 's bound to die some day .
An ' takin ' a heathen 's money to give a child a Christian education -- ' ` But he said explicitly what he wanted .
As soon as he knew the boy was white he seems to have made his arrangements accordingly .
I 'd give a month 's pay to hear how he explained it all at the Tirthankars ' Temple at Benares .
Look here , Padre , I do n't pretend to know much about natives , but if he says he 'll pay , he 'll pay -- dead or alive .
I mean , his heirs will assume the debt .
My advice to you is , send the boy down to Lucknow .
If your Anglican Chaplain thinks you 've stolen a march on him -- ' ` Bad luck to Bennett !
He was sent to the Front instead o ' me .
Doughty certified me medically unfit .
I 'll excommunicate Doughty if he comes back alive !
Surely Bennett ought to be content with -- ' ` Glory , leaving you the religion .
Quite so !
As a matter of fact I do n't think Bennett will mind .
Put the blame on me .
I -- er -- strongly recommend sending the boy to St Xavier 's .
He can go down on pass as a soldier 's orphan , so the railway fare will be saved .
You can buy him an outfit from the Regimental subscription .
The Lodge will be saved the expense of his education , and that will put the Lodge in a good temper .
It 's perfectly easy .
I 've got to go down to Lucknow next week .
I 'll look after the boy on the way -- give him in charge of my servants , and so on . '
` You 're a good man . '
` Not in the least .
Do n't make that mistake .
The lama has sent us money for a definite end .
We ca n't very well return it .
We shall have to do as he says .
Well , that 's settled , is n't it ?
Shall we say that , Tuesday next , you 'll hand him over to me at the night train south ?
That 's only three days .
He ca n't do much harm in three days . '
` It 's a weight off my mind , but -- this thing here ? '
-- he waved the note of hand -- ' I do n't know Gobind Sahai : or his bank , which may be a hole in a wall . '
` You 've never been a subaltern in debt .
I 'll cash it if you like , and send you the vouchers in proper order . '
` But with all your own work too !
It 's askin ' -- ' ` It 's not the least trouble indeed .
You see , as an ethnologist , the thing 's very interesting to me .
I 'd like to make a note of it for some Government work that I 'm doing .
The transformation of a regimental badge like your Red Bull into a sort of fetish that the boy follows is very interesting . '
` But I ca n't thank you enough . '
` There 's one thing you can do .
All we Ethnological men are as jealous as jackdaws of one another 's discoveries .
They 're of no interest to anyone but ourselves , of course , but you know what book-collectors are like .
Well , do n't say a word , directly or indirectly , about the Asiatic side of the boy 's character -- his adventures and his prophecy , and so on .
I 'll worm them out of the boy later on and -- you see ? ' '
I do .
Ye 'll make a wonderful account of it .
Never a word will I say to anyone till I see it in print . '
` Thank you .
That goes straight to an ethnologist 's heart .
Well , I must be getting back to my breakfast .
Good Heavens !
Old Mahbub here still ? '
He raised his voice , and the horse-dealer came out from under the shadow of the tree , ` Well , what is it ? '
` As regards that young horse , ' said Mahbub , ' I say that when a colt is born to be a polo-pony , closely following the ball without teaching -- when such a colt knows the game by divination -- then I say it is a great wrong to break that colt to a heavy cart , Sahib ! '
` So say I also , Mahbub .
The colt will be entered for polo only .
-LRB- These fellows think of nothing in the world but horses , Padre . -RRB-
I 'll see you tomorrow , Mahbub , if you 've anything likely for sale . '
The dealer saluted , horseman-fashion , with a sweep of the off hand .
` Be patient a little , Friend of all the World , ' he whispered to the agonized Kim .
` Thy fortune is made .
In a little while thou goest to Nucklao , and -- here is something to pay the letter-writer .
I shall see thee again , I think , many times , ' and he cantered off down the road .
` Listen to me , ' said the Colonel from the veranda , speaking in the vernacular .
` In three days thou wilt go with me to Lucknow , seeing and hearing new things all the while .
Therefore sit still for three days and do not run away .
Thou wilt go to school at Lucknow . '
` Shall I meet my Holy One there ? '
Kim whimpered .
` At least Lucknow is nearer to Benares than Umballa .
It may be thou wilt go under my protection .
Mahbub Ali knows this , and he will be angry if thou returnest to the Road now .
Remember -- much has been told me which I do not forget . ' '
I will wait , ' said Kim , ` but the boys will beat me . '
Then the bugles blew for dinner .
Chapter 7 Unto whose use the pregnant suns are poised With idiot moons and stars retracing stars ?

Sir John Christie .
In the afternoon the red-faced schoolmaster told Kim that he had been ` struck off the strength ' , which conveyed no meaning to him till he was ordered to go away and play .
Then he ran to the bazar , and found the young letter-writer to whom he owed a stamp .
` Now I pay , ' said Kim royally , ` and now I need another letter to be written . '
` Mahbub Ali is in Umballa , ' said the writer jauntily .
He was , by virtue of his office , a bureau of general misinformation .
` This is not to Mahbub , but to a priest .
Take thy pen and write quickly .
To Teshoo Lama , the Holy One from Bhotiyal seeking for a River , who is now in the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares .
Take more ink !
In three days I am to go down to Nucklao to the school at Nucklao .
The name of the school is Xavier .
I do not know where that school is , but it is at Nucklao . '
` But I know Nucklao , ' the writer interrupted . '
I know the school . '
` Tell him where it is , and I give half an anna . '
The reed pen scratched busily .
` He can not mistake . '
The man lifted his head .
` Who watches us across the street ? '
Kim looked up hurriedly and saw Colonel Creighton in tennis-flannels .
` Oh , that is some Sahib who knows the fat priest in the barracks .
He is beckoning me . '
` What dost thou ? '
said the Colonel , when Kim trotted up .
` I -- I am not running away .
I send a letter to my Holy One at Benares . ' '
I had not thought of that .
Hast thou said that I take thee to Lucknow ? '
` Nay , I have not .
Read the letter , if there be a doubt . '
` Then why hast thou left out my name in writing to that Holy One ? '
The Colonel smiled a queer smile .
Kim took his courage in both hands .
` It was said once to me that it is inexpedient to write the names of strangers concerned in any matter , because by the naming of names many good plans are brought to confusion . '
` Thou hast been well taught , ' the Colonel replied , and Kim flushed . '
I have left my cheroot-case in the Padre 's veranda .
Bring it to my house this even . '
` Where is the house ? '
said Kim .
His quick wit told him that he was being tested in some fashion or another , and he stood on guard .
` Ask anyone in the big bazar . '
The Colonel walked on .
` He has forgotten his cheroot-case , ' said Kim , returning . '
I must bring it to him this evening .
That is all my letter except , thrice over , Come to me !
Come to me !
Come to me !
Now I will pay for a stamp and put it in the post .
He rose to go , and as an afterthought asked : ` Who is that angry-faced Sahib who lost the cheroot-case ? '
` Oh , he is only Creighton Sahib -- a very foolish Sahib , who is a Colonel Sahib without a regiment . '
` What is his business ? '
` God knows .
He is always buying horses which he can not ride , and asking riddles about the works of God -- such as plants and stones and the customs of people .
The dealers call him the father of fools , because he is so easily cheated about a horse .
Mahbub Ali says he is madder than most other Sahibs . '
` Oh ! '
said Kim , and departed .
His training had given him some small knowledge of character , and he argued that fools are not given information which leads to calling out eight thousand men besides guns .
The Commander-in-Chief of all India does not talk , as Kim had heard him talk , to fools .
Nor would Mahbub Ali 's tone have changed , as it did every time he mentioned the Colonel 's name , if the Colonel had been a fool .
Consequently -- and this set Kim to skipping -- there was a mystery somewhere , and Mahbub Ali probably spied for the Colonel much as Kim had spied for Mahbub .
And , like the horse-dealer , the Colonel evidently respected people who did not show themselves to be too clever .
He rejoiced that he had not betrayed his knowledge of the Colonel 's house ; and when , on his return to barracks , he discovered that no cheroot-case had been left behind , he beamed with delight .
Here was a man after his own heart -- a tortuous and indirect person playing a hidden game .
Well , if he could be a fool , so could Kim .
He showed nothing of his mind when Father Victor , for three long mornings , discoursed to him of an entirely new set of Gods and Godlings -- notably of a Goddess called Mary , who , he gathered , was one with Bibi Miriam of Mahbub Ali 's theology .
He betrayed no emotion when , after the lecture , Father Victor dragged him from shop to shop buying articles of outfit , nor when envious drummer-boys kicked him because he was going to a superior school did he complain , but awaited the play of circumstances with an interested soul .
Father Victor , good man , took him to the station , put him into an empty second-class next to Colonel Creighton 's first , and bade him farewell with genuine feeling .
` They 'll make a man o ' you , O'Hara , at St Xavier 's -- a white man , an ' , I hope , a good man .
They know all about your comin ' , an ' the Colonel will see that ye 're not lost or mislaid anywhere on the road .
I 've given you a notion of religious matters , -- at least I hope so , -- and you 'll remember , when they ask you your religion , that you 're a Cath ` lic .
Better say Roman Cath ` lic , tho ' I 'm not fond of the word . '
Kim lit a rank cigarette -- he had been careful to buy a stock in the bazar -- and lay down to think .
This solitary passage was very different from that joyful down-journey in the third-class with the lama .
` Sahibs get little pleasure of travel , ' he reflected .
` Hai mai !
I go from one place to another as it might be a kickball .
It is my Kismet .
No man can escape his Kismet .
But I am to pray to Bibi Miriam , and I am a Sahib . '
He looked at his boots ruefully .
` No ; I am Kim .
This is the great world , and I am only Kim .
Who is Kim ? '
He considered his own identity , a thing he had never done before , till his head swam .
He was one insignificant person in all this roaring whirl of India , going southward to he knew not what fate .
Presently the Colonel sent for him , and talked for a long time .
So far as Kim could gather , he was to be diligent and enter the Survey of India as a chain-man .
If he were very good , and passed the proper examinations , he would be earning thirty rupees a month at seventeen years old , and Colonel Creighton would see that he found suitable employment .
Kim pretended at first to understand perhaps one word in three of this talk .
Then the Colonel , seeing his mistake , turned to fluent and picturesque Urdu and Kim was contented .
No man could be a fool who knew the language so intimately , who moved so gently and silently , and whose eyes were so different from the dull fat eyes of other Sahibs .
` Yes , and thou must learn how to make pictures of roads and mountains and rivers , to carry these pictures in thine eye till a suitable time comes to set them upon paper .
Perhaps some day , when thou art a chain-man , I may say to thee when we are working together : `` Go across those hills and see what lies beyond . ''
Then one will say : `` There are bad people living in those hills who will slay the chain-man if he be seen to look like a Sahib . ''
What then ? '
Kim thought .
Would it be safe to return the Colonel 's lead ? '
I would tell what that other man had said . '
` But if I answered : `` I will give thee a hundred rupees for knowledge of what is behind those hills -- for a picture of a river and a little news of what the people say in the villages there '' ? '
` How can I tell ?
I am only a boy .
Wait till I am a man . '
Then , seeing the Colonel 's brow clouded , he went on : ` But I think I should in a few days earn the hundred rupees . '
` By what road ? '
Kim shook his head resolutely .
` If I said how I would earn them , another man might hear and forestall me .
It is not good to sell knowledge for nothing . '
` Tell now . '
The Colonel held up a rupee .
Kim 's hand half reached towards it , and dropped .
` Nay , Sahib ; nay .
I know the price that will be paid for the answer , but I do not know why the question is asked . '
` Take it for a gift , then , ' said Creighton , tossing it over .
` There is a good spirit in thee .
Do not let it be blunted at St Xavier 's .
There are many boys there who despise the black men . '
` Their mothers were bazar-women , ' said Kim .
He knew well there is no hatred like that of the half-caste for his brother-in-law .
` True ; but thou art a Sahib and the son of a Sahib .
Therefore , do not at any time be led to contemn the black men .
I have known boys newly entered into the service of the Government who feigned not to understand the talk or the customs of black men .
Their pay was cut for ignorance .
There is no sin so great as ignorance .
Remember this . '
Several times in the course of the long twenty-four hours ' run south did the Colonel send for Kim , always developing this latter text .
` We be all on one lead-rope , then , ' said Kim at last , ` the Colonel , Mahbub Ali , and I -- when I become a chain-man .
He will use me as Mahbub Ali employed me , I think .
That is good , if it allows me to return to the Road again .
This clothing grows no easier by wear . '
When they came to the crowded Lucknow station there was no sign of the lama .
He swallowed his disappointment , while the Colonel bundled him into a ticca-gharri with his neat belongings and despatched him alone to St Xavier 's . '
I do not say farewell , because we shall meet again , ' he cried .
` Again , and many times , if thou art one of good spirit .
But thou art not yet tried . '
` Not when I brought thee ' -- Kim actually dared to use the turn of equals -- ' a white stallion 's pedigree that night ? '
` Much is gained by forgetting , little brother , ' said the Colonel , with a look that pierced through Kim 's shoulder-blades as he scuttled into the carriage .
It took him nearly five minutes to recover .
Then he sniffed the new air appreciatively . '
A rich city , ' he said .
` Richer than Lahore .
How good the bazars must be !
Coachman , drive me a little through the bazars here . '
` My order is to take thee to the school . '
The driver used the ` thou ' , which is rudeness when applied to a white man .
In the clearest and most fluent vernacular Kim pointed out his error , climbed on to the box-seat , and , perfect understanding established , drove for a couple of hours up and down , estimating , comparing , and enjoying .
There is no city -- except Bombay , the queen of all -- more beautiful in her garish style than Lucknow , whether you see her from the bridge over the river , or from the top of the Imambara looking down on the gilt umbrellas of the Chutter Munzil , and the trees in which the town is bedded .
Kings have adorned her with fantastic buildings , endowed her with charities , crammed her with pensioners , and drenched her with blood .
She is the centre of all idleness , intrigue , and luxury , and shares with Delhi the claim to talk the only pure Urdu . '
A fair city -- a beautiful city . '
The driver , as a Lucknow man , was pleased with the compliment , and told Kim many astounding things where an English guide would have talked of the Mutiny .
` Now we will go to the school , ' said Kim at last .
The great old school of St Xavier 's in Partibus , block on block of low white buildings , stands in vast grounds over against the Gumti River , at some distance from the city .
` What like of folk are they within ? '
said Kim .
` Young Sahibs -- all devils .
But to speak truth , and I drive many of them to and fro from the railway station , I have never seen one that had in him the making of a more perfect devil than thou -- this young Sahib whom I am now driving . '
Naturally , for he was never trained to consider them in any way improper , Kim had passed the time of day with one or two frivolous ladies at upper windows in a certain street , and naturally , in the exchange of compliments , had acquitted himself well .
He was about to acknowledge the driver 's last insolence , when his eye -- it was growing dusk -- caught a figure sitting by one of the white plaster gate-pillars in the long sweep of wall .
` Stop ! '
he cried .
` Stay here .
I do not go to the school at once . '
` But what is to pay me for this coming and re-coming ? '
said the driver petulantly .
` Is the boy mad ?
Last time it was a dancing-girl .
This time it is a priest . '
Kim was in the road headlong , patting the dusty feet beneath the dirty yellow robe . '
I have waited here a day and a half , ' the lama 's level voice began .
` Nay , I had a disciple with me .
He that was my friend at the Temple of the Tirthankars gave me a guide for this journey .
I came from Benares in the te-rain , when thy letter was given me .
Yes , I am well fed .
I need nothing . '
` But why didst thou not stay with the Kulu woman , O Holy One ?
In what way didst thou get to Benares ?
My heart has been heavy since we parted . '
` The woman wearied me by constant flux of talk and requiring charms for children .
I separated myself from that company , permitting her to acquire merit by gifts .
She is at least a woman of open hands , and I made a promise to return to her house if need arose .
Then , perceiving myself alone in this great and terrible world , I bethought me of the te-rain to Benares , where I knew one abode in the Tirthankars ' Temple who was a Seeker , even as I. ' ` Ah !
Thy River , ' said Kim . '
I had forgotten the River . '
` So soon , my chela ?
I have never forgotten it .
But when I had left thee it seemed better that I should go to the Temple and take counsel , for , look you , India is very large , and it may be that wise men before us , some two or three , have left a record of the place of our River .
There is debate in the Temple of the Tirthankars on this matter ; some saying one thing , and some another .
They are courteous folk . '
` So be it ; but what dost thou do now ? ' '
I acquire merit in that I help thee , my chela , to wisdom .
The priest of that body of men who serve the Red Bull wrote me that all should be as I desired for thee .
I sent the money to suffice for one year , and then I came , as thou seest me , to watch for thee going up into the Gates of Learning .
A day and a half have I waited , not because I was led by any affection towards thee -- that is no part of the Way -- but , as they said at the Tirthankars ' Temple , because , money having been paid for learning , it was right that I should oversee the end of the matter .
They resolved my doubts most clearly .
I had a fear that , perhaps , I came because I wished to see thee -- misguided by the Red Mist of affection .
It is not so ... Moreover , I am troubled by a dream . '
` But surely , Holy One , thou hast not forgotten the Road and all that befell on it .
Surely it was a little to see me that thou didst come ? '
` The horses are cold , and it is past their feeding-time , ' whined the driver .
` Go to Jehannum and abide there with thy reputationless aunt ! '
Kim snarled over his shoulder . '
I am all alone in this land ; I know not where I go nor what shall befall me .
My heart was in that letter I sent thee .
Except for Mahbub Ali , and he is a Pathan , I have no friend save thee , Holy One .
Do not altogether go away . ' '
I have considered that also , ' the lama replied , in a shaking voice .
` It is manifest that from time to time I shall acquire merit if before that I have not found my River -- by assuring myself that thy feet are set on wisdom .
What they will teach thee I do not know , but the priest wrote me that no son of a Sahib in all India will be better taught than thou .
So from time to time , therefore , I will come again .
Maybe thou wilt be such a Sahib as he who gave me these spectacles ' -- the lama wiped them elaborately -- ` in the Wonder House at Lahore .
That is my hope , for he was a Fountain of Wisdom -- wiser than many abbots ... Again , maybe thou wilt forget me and our meetings . '
` If I eat thy bread , ' cried Kim passionately , ` how shall I ever forget thee ? '
` No -- no . '
He put the boy aside . '
I must go back to Benares .
From time to time , now that I know the customs of letter-writers in this land , I will send thee a letter , and from time to time I will come and see thee . '
` But whither shall I send my letters ? '
wailed Kim , clutching at the robe , all forgetful that he was a Sahib .
` To the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares .
That is the place I have chosen till I find my River .
Do not weep ; for , look you , all Desire is Illusion and a new binding upon the Wheel .
Go up to the Gates of Learning .
Let me see thee go ... Dost thou love me ?
Then go , or my heart cracks ... I will come again .
Surely I will come again .
The lama watched the ticca-gharri rumble into the compound , and strode off , snuffing between each long stride .
` The Gates of Learning ' shut with a clang .
The country born and bred boy has his own manners and customs , which do not resemble those of any other land ; and his teachers approach him by roads which an English master would not understand .
Therefore , you would scarcely be interested in Kim 's experiences as a St Xavier 's boy among two or three hundred precocious youths , most of whom had never seen the sea .
He suffered the usual penalties for breaking out of bounds when there was cholera in the city .
This was before he had learned to write fair English , and so was obliged to find a bazar letter-writer .
He was , of course , indicted for smoking and for the use of abuse more full-flavoured than even St Xavier 's had ever heard .
He learned to wash himself with the Levitical scrupulosity of the native-born , who in his heart considers the Englishman rather dirty .
He played the usual tricks on the patient coolies pulling the punkahs in the sleeping-rooms where the boys threshed through the hot nights telling tales till the dawn ; and quietly he measured himself against his self-reliant mates .
They were sons of subordinate officials in the Railway , Telegraph , and Canal Services ; of warrant-officers , sometimes retired and sometimes acting as commanders-in-chief to a feudatory Rajah 's army ; of captains of the Indian Marine Government pensioners , planters , Presidency shopkeepers , and missionaries .
A few were cadets of the old Eurasian houses that have taken strong root in Dhurrumtollah -- Pereiras , De Souzas , and D'Silvas .
Their parents could well have educated them in England , but they loved the school that had served their own youth , and generation followed sallow-hued generation at St Xavier 's .
Their homes ranged from Howrah of the railway people to abandoned cantonments like Monghyr and Chunar ; lost tea-gardens Shillong-way ; villages where their fathers were large landholders in Oudh or the Deccan ; Mission-stations a week from the nearest railway line ; seaports a thousand miles south , facing the brazen Indian surf ; and cinchona-plantations south of all .
The mere story of their adventures , which to them were no adventures , on their road to and from school would have crisped a Western boy 's hair .
They were used to jogging off alone through a hundred miles of jungle , where there was always the delightful chance of being delayed by tigers ; but they would no more have bathed in the English Channel in an English August than their brothers across the world would have lain still while a leopard snuffed at their palanquin .
There were boys of fifteen who had spent a day and a half on an islet in the middle of a flooded river , taking charge , as by right , of a camp of frantic pilgrims returning from a shrine .
There were seniors who had requisitioned a chance-met Rajah 's elephant , in the name of St Francis Xavier , when the Rains once blotted out the cart-track that led to their father 's estate , and had all but lost the huge beast in a quicksand .
There was a boy who , he said , and none doubted , had helped his father to beat off with rifles from the veranda a rush of Akas in the days when those head-hunters were bold against lonely plantations .
And every tale was told in the even , passionless voice of the native-born , mixed with quaint reflections , borrowed unconsciously from native foster-mothers , and turns of speech that showed they had been that instant translated from the vernacular .
Kim watched , listened , and approved .
This was not insipid , single-word talk of drummer-boys .
It dealt with a life he knew and in part understood .
The atmosphere suited him , and he throve by inches .
They gave him a white drill suit as the weather warmed , and he rejoiced in the new-found bodily comforts as he rejoiced to use his sharpened mind over the tasks they set him .
His quickness would have delighted an English master ; but at St Xavier 's they know the first rush of minds developed by sun and surroundings , as they know the half-collapse that sets in at twenty-two or twenty-three .
None the less he remembered to hold himself lowly .
When tales were told of hot nights , Kim did not sweep the board with his reminiscences ; for St Xavier 's looks down on boys who ` go native all-together . '
One must never forget that one is a Sahib , and that some day , when examinations are passed , one will command natives .
Kim made a note of this , for he began to understand where examinations led .
Then came the holidays from August to October -- the long holidays imposed by the heat and the Rains .
Kim was informed that he would go north to some station in the hills behind Umballa , where Father Victor would arrange for him . '
A barrack-school ? '
said Kim , who had asked many questions and thought more .
` Yes , I suppose so , ' said the master .
` It will not do you any harm to keep you out of mischief .
You can go up with young De Castro as far as Delhi . '
Kim considered it in every possible light .
He had been diligent , even as the Colonel advised .
A boy 's holiday was his own property -- of so much the talk of his companions had advised him , -- and a barrack-school would be torment after St Xavier 's .
Moreover -- this was magic worth anything else -- he could write .
In three months he had discovered how men can speak to each other without a third party , at the cost of half an anna and a little knowledge .
No word had come from the lama , but there remained the Road .
Kim yearned for the caress of soft mud squishing up between the toes , as his mouth watered for mutton stewed with butter and cabbages , for rice speckled with strong scented cardamoms , for the saffron-tinted rice , garlic and onions , and the forbidden greasy sweetmeats of the bazars .
They would feed him raw beef on a platter at the barrack-school , and he must smoke by stealth .
But again , he was a Sahib and was at St Xavier 's , and that pig Mahbub Ali ... No , he would not test Mahbub 's hospitality -- and yet ... He thought it out alone in the dormitory , and came to the conclusion he had been unjust to Mahbub .
The school was empty ; nearly all the masters had gone away ; Colonel Creighton 's railway pass lay in his hand , and Kim puffed himself that he had not spent Colonel Creighton 's or Mahbub 's money in riotous living .
He was still lord of two rupees seven annas .
His new bullock-trunk , marked ` K. O ` H. ' , and bedding-roll lay in the empty sleeping-room .
` Sahibs are always tied to their baggage , ' said Kim , nodding at them .
` You will stay here ' He went out into the warm rain , smiling sinfully , and sought a certain house whose outside he had noted down some time before ... ` Arre ' !
Dost thou know what manner of women we be in this quarter ?
Oh , shame ! '
` Was I born yesterday ? '
Kim squatted native-fashion on the cushions of that upper room . '
A little dyestuff and three yards of cloth to help out a jest .
Is it much to ask ? '
` Who is she ?
Thou art full young , as Sahibs go , for this devilry . '
` Oh , she ?
She is the daughter of a certain schoolmaster of a regiment in the cantonments .
He has beaten me twice because I went over their wall in these clothes .
Now I would go as a gardener 's boy .
Old men are very jealous . '
` That is true .
Hold thy face still while I dab on the juice . '
` Not too black , Naikan .
I would not appear to her as a hubshi -LRB- nigger -RRB- . '
` Oh , love makes nought of these things .
And how old is she ? '
` Twelve years , I think , ' said the shameless Kim .
` Spread it also on the breast .
It may be her father will tear my clothes off me , and if I am piebald -- ' he laughed .
The girl worked busily , dabbing a twist of cloth into a little saucer of brown dye that holds longer than any walnut-juice .
` Now send out and get me a cloth for the turban .
Woe is me , my head is all unshaved !
And he will surely knock off my turban . ' '
I am not a barber , but I will make shift .
Thou wast born to be a breaker of hearts !
All this disguise for one evening ?
Remember , the stuff does not wash away . '
She shook with laughter till her bracelets and anklets jingled .
` But who is to pay me for this ?
Huneefa herself could not have given thee better stuff . '
` Trust in the Gods , my sister , ' said Kim gravely , screwing his face round as the stain dried .
` Besides , hast thou ever helped to paint a Sahib thus before ? '
` Never indeed .
But a jest is not money . '
` It is worth much more . '
` Child , thou art beyond all dispute the most shameless son of Shaitan that I have ever known to take up a poor girl 's time with this play , and then to say : `` Is not the jest enough ? ''
Thou wilt go very far in this world . '
She gave the dancing-girls ' salutation in mockery .
` All one .
Make haste and rough-cut my head . '
Kim shifted from foot to foot , his eyes ablaze with mirth as he thought of the fat days before him .
He gave the girl four annas , and ran down the stairs in the likeness of a low-caste Hindu boy -- perfect in every detail .
A cookshop was his next point of call , where he feasted in extravagance and greasy luxury .
On Lucknow station platform he watched young De Castro , all covered with prickly-heat , get into a second-class compartment .
Kim patronized a third , and was the life and soul of it .
He explained to the company that he was assistant to a juggler who had left him behind sick with fever , and that he would pick up his master at Umballa .
As the occupants of the carriage changed , he varied this tale , or adorned it with all the shoots of a budding fancy , the more rampant for being held off native speech so long .
In all India that night was no human being so joyful as Kim .
At Umballa he got out and headed eastward , plashing over the sodden fields to the village where the old soldier lived .
About this time Colonel Creighton at Simla was advised from Lucknow by wire that young O'Hara had disappeared .
Mahbub Ali was in town selling horses , and to him the Colonel confided the affair one morning cantering round Annandale racecourse .
` Oh , that is nothing , ' said the horse-dealer .
` Men are like horses .
At certain times they need salt , and if that salt is not in the mangers they will lick it up from the earth .
He has gone back to the Road again for a while .
The madrissak wearied him .
I knew it would .
Another time , I will take him upon the Road myself .
Do not be troubled , Creighton Sahib .
It is as though a polo-pony , breaking loose , ran out to learn the game alone . '
` Then he is not dead , think you ? '
` Fever might kill him .
I do not fear for the boy otherwise .
A monkey does not fall among trees . '
Next morning , on the same course , Mahbub 's stallion ranged alongside the Colonel .
` It is as I had thought , ' said the horse-dealer .
` He has come through Umballa at least , and there he has written a letter to me , having learned in the bazar that I was here . '
` Read , ' said the Colonel , with a sigh of relief .
It was absurd that a man of his position should take an interest in a little country-bred vagabond ; but the Colonel remembered the conversation in the train , and often in the past few months had caught himself thinking of the queer , silent , self-possessed boy .
His evasion , of course , was the height of insolence , but it argued some resource and nerve .
Mahbub 's eyes twinkled as he reined out into the centre of the cramped little plain , where none could come near unseen . '
`` The Friend of the Stars , who is the Friend of all the World -- '' ' ` What is this ? ' '
A name we give him in Lahore city .
`` The Friend of all the World takes leave to go to his own places .
He will come back upon the appointed day .
Let the box and the bedding-roll be sent for ; and if there has been a fault , let the Hand of Friendship turn aside the Whip of Calamity . ''
There is yet a little more , but -- ' ` No matter , read . ' '
`` Certain things are not known to those who eat with forks .
It is better to eat with both hands for a while .
Speak soft words to those who do not understand this that the return may be propitious . ''
Now the manner in which that was cast is , of course , the work of the letter-writer , but see how wisely the boy has devised the matter of it so that no hint is given except to those who know ! '
` Is this the Hand of Friendship to avert the Whip of Calamity ? '
laughed the Colonel .
` See how wise is the boy .
He would go back to the Road again , as I said .
Not knowing yet thy trade -- ' ' I am not at all sure of that , ' the Colonel muttered .
` He turns to me to make a peace between you .
Is he not wise ?
He says he will return .
He is but perfecting his knowledge .
Think , Sahib !
He has been three months at the school .
And he is not mouthed to that bit .
For my part , I rejoice .
The pony learns the game . '
` Ay , but another time he must not go alone . '
` Why ?
He went alone before he came under the Colonel Sahib 's protection .
When he comes to the Great Game he must go alone -- alone , and at peril of his head .
Then , if he spits , or sneezes , or sits down other than as the people do whom he watches , he may be slain .
Why hinder him now ?
Remember how the Persians say : The jackal that lives in the wilds of Mazanderan can only be caught by the hounds of Mazanderan . '
` True .
It is true , Mahbub Ali .
And if he comes to no harm , I do not desire anything better .
But it is great insolence on his part . '
` He does not tell me , even , whither he goes , ' said Mahbub .
` He is no fool .
When his time is accomplished he will come to me .
It is time the healer of pearls took him in hand .
He ripens too quickly -- as Sahibs reckon . '
This prophecy was fulfilled to the letter a month later .
Mahbub had gone down to Umballa to bring up a fresh consignment of horses , and Kim met him on the Kalka road at dusk riding alone , begged an alms of him , was sworn at , and replied in English .
There was nobody within earshot to hear Mahbub 's gasp of amazement .
` Oho !
And where hast thou been ? '
` Up and down -- down and up . '
` Come under a tree , out of the wet , and tell . ' '
I stayed for a while with an old man near Umballa ; anon with a household of my acquaintance in Umballa .
With one of these I went as far as Delhi to the southward .
That is a wondrous city .
Then I drove a bullock for a teli -LSB- an oilman -RSB- coming north ; but I heard of a great feast forward in Patiala , and thither went I in the company of a firework-maker .
It was a great feast ' -LRB- Kim rubbed his stomach -RRB- . '
I saw Rajahs , and elephants with gold and silver trappings ; and they lit all the fireworks at once , whereby eleven men were killed , my fire-work-maker among them , and I was blown across a tent but took no harm .
Then I came back to the rel with a Sikh horseman , to whom I was groom for my bread ; and so here . '
` Shabash ! '
said Mahbub Ali .
` But what does the Colonel Sahib say ?
I do not wish to be beaten . '
` The Hand of Friendship has averted the Whip of Calamity ; but another time , when thou takest the Road it will be with me .
This is too early . '
` Late enough for me .
I have learned to read and to write English a little at the madrissah .
I shall soon be altogether a Sahib . '
` Hear him ! '
laughed Mahbub , looking at the little drenched figure dancing in the wet .
` Salaam -- Sahib , ' and he saluted ironically .
` Well , art tired of the Road , or wilt thou come on to Umballa with me and work back with the horses ? ' '
I come with thee , Mahbub Ali . '
Chapter 8 Something I owe to the soil that grew -- More to the life that fed -- But most to Allah Who gave me two Separate sides to my head .
I would go without shirts or shoes , Friends , tobacco or bread Sooner than for an instant lose Either side of my head . '
The Two-Sided Man .
` Then in God 's name take blue for red , ' said Mahbub , alluding to the Hindu colour of Kim 's disreputable turban .
Kim countered with the old proverb , ' I will change my faith and my bedding , but thou must pay for it . '
The dealer laughed till he nearly fell from his horse .
At a shop on the outskirts of the city the change was made , and Kim stood up , externally at least , a Mohammedan .
Mahbub hired a room over against the railway station , sent for a cooked meal of the finest with the almond-curd sweet-meats -LSB- balushai we call it -RSB- and fine-chopped Lucknow tobacco .
` This is better than some other meat that I ate with the Sikh , ' said Kim , grinning as he squatted , ` and assuredly they give no such victuals at my madrissah . ' '
I have a desire to hear of that same madrissah . '
Mahbub stuffed himself with great boluses of spiced mutton fried in fat with cabbage and golden-brown onions .
` But tell me first , altogether and truthfully , the manner of thy escape .
For , O Friend of all the World , ' -- he loosed his cracking belt -- ' I do not think it is often that a Sahib and the son of a Sahib runs away from there . '
` How should they ?
They do not know the land .
It was nothing , ' said Kim , and began his tale .
When he came to the disguisement and the interview with the girl in the bazar , Mahbub Ali 's gravity went from him .
He laughed aloud and beat his hand on his thigh .
` Shabash !
Shabash !
Oh , well done , little one !
What will the healer of turquoises say to this ?
Now , slowly , let us hear what befell afterwards -- step by step , omitting nothing . '
Step by step then , Kim told his adventures between coughs as the full-flavoured tobacco caught his lungs . '
I said , ' growled Mahbub Ali to himself , ' I said it was the pony breaking out to play polo .
The fruit is ripe already -- except that he must learn his distances and his pacings , and his rods and his compasses .
Listen now .
I have turned aside the Colonel 's whip from thy skin , and that is no small service . '
` True . '
Kim pulled serenely .
` That is true . '
` But it is not to be thought that this running out and in is any way good . '
` It was my holiday , Hajji .
I was a slave for many weeks .
Why should I not run away when the school was shut ?
Look , too , how I , living upon my friends or working for my bread , as I did with the Sikh , have saved the Colonel Sahib a great expense . '
Mahbub 's lips twitched under his well-pruned Mohammedan moustache .
` What are a few rupees ' -- the Pathan threw out his open hand carelessly -- ` to the Colonel Sahib ?
He spends them for a purpose , not in any way for love of thee . '
` That , ' said Kim slowly , ' I knew a very long time ago . '
` Who told ? '
` The Colonel Sahib himself .
Not in those many words , but plainly enough for one who is not altogether a mud-head .
Yea , he told me in the te-rain when we went down to Lucknow . '
` Be it so .
Then I will tell thee more , Friend of all the World , though in the telling I lend thee my head . '
` It was forfeit to me , ' said Kim , with deep relish , ` in Umballa , when thou didst pick me up on the horse after the drummer-boy beat me . '
` Speak a little plainer .
All the world may tell lies save thou and I. For equally is thy life forfeit to me if I chose to raise my finger here . '
` And this is known to me also , ' said Kim , readjusting the live charcoal-ball on the weed .
` It is a very sure tie between us .
Indeed , thy hold is surer even than mine ; for who would miss a boy beaten to death , or , it may be , thrown into a well by the roadside ?
Most people here and in Simla and across the passes behind the Hills would , on the other hand , say : `` What has come to Mahbub Ali ? ''
if he were found dead among his horses .
Surely , too , the Colonel Sahib would make inquiries .
But again , ' -- Kim 's face puckered with cunning , -- ` he would not make overlong inquiry , lest people should ask : `` What has this Colonel Sahib to do with that horse-dealer ? ''
But I -- if I lived -- ' ` As thou wouldst surely die -- ' ` Maybe ; but I say , if I lived , I , and I alone , would know that one had come by night , as a common thief perhaps , to Mahbub Ali 's bulkhead in the serai , and there had slain him , either before or after that thief had made a full search into his saddlebags and between the soles of his slippers .
Is that news to tell to the Colonel , or would he say to me -- -LRB- I have not forgotten when he sent me back for a cigar-case that he had not left behind him -RRB- -- `` What is Mahbub Ali to me ? ''
? '
Up went a gout of heavy smoke .
There was a long pause : then Mahbub Ali spoke in admiration : ` And with these things on thy mind , dost thou lie down and rise again among all the Sahibs ' little sons at the madrissah and meekly take instruction from thy teachers ? '
` It is an order , ' said Kim blandly .
` Who am I to dispute an order ? ' '
A most finished Son of Eblis , ' said Mahbub Ali .
` But what is this tale of the thief and the search ? '
` That which I saw , ' said Kim , ` the night that my lama and I lay next thy place in the Kashmir Seral .
The door was left unlocked , which I think is not thy custom , Mahbub .
He came in as one assured that thou wouldst not soon return .
My eye was against a knot-hole in the plank .
He searched as it were for something -- not a rug , not stirrups , nor a bridle , nor brass pots -- something little and most carefully hid .
Else why did he prick with an iron between the soles of thy slippers ? '
` Ha ! '
Mahbub Ali smiled gently .
` And seeing these things , what tale didst thou fashion to thyself , Well of the Truth ? '
` None .
I put my hand upon my amulet , which lies always next to my skin , and , remembering the pedigree of a white stallion that I had bitten out of a piece of Mussalmani bread , I went away to Umballa perceiving that a heavy trust was laid upon me .
At that hour , had I chosen , thy head was forfeit .
It needed only to say to that man , `` I have here a paper concerning a horse which I can not read . ''
And then ? '
Kim peered at Mahbub under his eyebrows .
` Then thou wouldst have drunk water twice -- perhaps thrice , afterwards .
I do not think more than thrice , ' said Mahbub simply .
` It is true .
I thought of that a little , but most I thought that I loved thee , Mahbub .
Therefore I went to Umballa , as thou knowest , but -LRB- and this thou dost not know -RRB- I lay hid in the garden-grass to see what Colonel Creighton Sahib might do upon reading the white stallion 's pedigree . '
` And what did he ? '
for Kim had bitten off the conversation .
` Dost thou give news for love , or dost thou sell it ? '
Kim asked . '
I sell and -- I buy . '
Mahbub took a four-anna piece out of his belt and held it up .
` Eight ! '
said Kim , mechanically following the huckster instinct of the East .
Mahbub laughed , and put away the coin .
` It is too easy to deal in that market , Friend of all the World .
Tell me for love .
Our lives lie in each other 's hand . '
` Very good .
I saw the Jang-i-Lat Sahib -LSB- the Commander-in-Chief -RSB- come to a big dinner .
I saw him in Creighton Sahib 's office .
I saw the two read the white stallion 's pedigree .
I heard the very orders given for the opening of a great war . '
` Hah ! '
Mahbub nodded with deepest eyes afire .
` The game is well played .
That war is done now , and the evil , we hope , nipped before the flower -- thanks to me -- and thee .
What didst thou later ? ' '
I made the news as it were a hook to catch me victual and honour among the villagers in a village whose priest drugged my lama .
But I bore away the old man 's purse , and the Brahmin found nothing .
So next morning he was angry .
Ho !
Ho !
And I also used the news when I fell into the hands of that white Regiment with their Bull ! '
` That was foolishness . '
Mahbub scowled .
` News is not meant to be thrown about like dung-cakes , but used sparingly -- like bhang . '
` So I think now , and moreover , it did me no sort of good .
But that was very long ago , ' he made as to brush it all away with a thin brown hand -- ` and since then , and especially in the nights under the punkah at the madrissah , I have thought very greatly . '
` Is it permitted to ask whither the Heaven-born 's thought might have led ? '
said Mahbub , with an elaborate sarcasm , smoothing his scarlet beard .
` It is permitted , ' said Kim , and threw back the very tone .
` They say at Nucklao that no Sahib must tell a black man that he has made a fault . '
Mahbub 's hand shot into his bosom , for to call a Pathan a ` black man ' -LSB- kala admi -RSB- is a blood-insult .
Then he remembered and laughed .
` Speak , Sahib .
Thy black man hears . '
` But , ' said Kim , ' I am not a Sahib , and I say I made a fault to curse thee , Mahbub Ali , on that day at Umballa when I thought I was betrayed by a Pathan .
I was senseless ; for I was but newly caught , and I wished to kill that low-caste drummer-boy .
I say now , Hajji , that it was well done ; and I see my road all clear before me to a good service .
I will stay in the madrissah till I am ripe . '
` Well said .
Especially are distances and numbers and the manner of using compasses to be learned in that game .
One waits in the Hills above to show thee . ' '
I will learn their teaching upon a condition -- that my time is given to me without question when the madrissah is shut .
Ask that for me of the Colonel . '
` But why not ask the Colonel in the Sahibs ' tongue ? '
` The Colonel is the servant of the Government .
He is sent hither and yon at a word , and must consider his own advancement .
-LRB- See how much I have already learned at Nucklao ! -RRB-
Moreover , the Colonel I know since three months only .
I have known one Mahbub Ali for six years .
So !
To the madrissah I will go .
At the madrissah I will learn .
In the madrissah I will be a Sahib .
But when the madrissah is shut , then must I be free and go among my people .
Otherwise I die ! '
` And who are thy people , Friend of all the World ? '
` This great and beautiful land , ' said Kim , waving his paw round the little clay-walled room where the oil-lamp in its niche burned heavily through the tobacco-smoke .
` And , further , I would see my lama again .
And , further , I need money . '
` That is the need of everyone , ' said Mahbub ruefully . '
I will give thee eight annas , for much money is not picked out of horses ' hooves , and it must suffice for many days .
As to all the rest , I am well pleased , and no further talk is needed .
Make haste to learn , and in three years , or it may be less , thou wilt be an aid -- even to me . '
` Have I been such a hindrance till now ? '
said Kim , with a boy 's giggle .
` Do not give answers , ' Mahbub grunted .
` Thou art my new horse-boy .
Go and bed among my men .
They are near the north end of the station , with the horses . '
` They will beat me to the south end of the station if I come without authority . '
Mahbub felt in his belt , wetted his thumb on a cake of Chinese ink , and dabbed the impression on a piece of soft native paper .
From Balkh to Bombay men know that rough-ridged print with the old scar running diagonally across it .
` That is enough to show my headman .
I come in the morning . '
` By which road ? '
said Kim .
` By the road from the city .
There is but one , and then we return to Creighton Sahib .
I have saved thee a beating . '
` Allah !
What is a beating when the very head is loose on the shoulders ? '
Kim slid out quietly into the night , walked half round the house , keeping close to the walls , and headed away from the station for a mile or so .
Then , fetching a wide compass , he worked back at leisure , for he needed time to invent a story if any of Mahbub 's retainers asked questions .
They were camped on a piece of waste ground beside the railway , and , being natives , had not , of course , unloaded the two trucks in which Mahbub 's animals stood among a consignment of country-breds bought by the Bombay tram-company .
The headman , a broken-down , consumptive-looking Mohammedan , promptly challenged Kim , but was pacified at sight of Mahbub 's sign-manual .
` The Hajji has of his favour given me service , ' said Kim testily .
` If this be doubted , wait till he comes in the morning .
Meantime , a place by the fire . '
Followed the usual aimless babble that every low-caste native must raise on every occasion .
It died down , and Kim lay out behind the little knot of Mahbub 's followers , almost under the wheels of a horse-truck , a borrowed blanket for covering .
Now a bed among brickbats and ballast-refuse on a damp night , between overcrowded horses and unwashed Baltis , would not appeal to many white boys ; but Kim was utterly happy .
Change of scene , service , and surroundings were the breath of his little nostrils , and thinking of the neat white cots of St Xavier 's all arow under the punkah gave him joy as keen as the repetition of the multiplication-table in English . '
I am very old , ' he thought sleepily .
` Every month I become a year more old .
I was very young , and a fool to boot , when I took Mahbub 's message to Umballa .
Even when I was with that white Regiment I was very young and small and had no wisdom .
But now I learn every day , and in three years the Colonel will take me out of the madrissah and let me go upon the Road with Mahbub hunting for horses ' pedigrees , or maybe I shall go by myself ; or maybe I shall find the lama and go with him .
Yes ; that is best .
To walk again as a chela with my lama when he comes back to Benares . '
The thoughts came more slowly and disconnectedly .
He was plunging into a beautiful dreamland when his ears caught a whisper , thin and sharp , above the monotonous babble round the fire .
It came from behind the iron-skinned horse-truck .
` He is not here , then ? '
` Where should he be but roystering in the city .
Who looks for a rat in a frog-pond ?
Come away .
He is not our man . '
` He must not go back beyond the Passes a second time .
It is the order . '
` Hire some woman to drug him .
It is a few rupees only , and there is no evidence . '
` Except the woman .
It must be more certain ; and remember the price upon his head . '
` Ay , but the police have a long arm , and we are far from the Border .
If it were in Peshawur , now ! '
` Yes -- in Peshawur , ' the second voice sneered .
` Peshawur , full of his blood-kin -- full of bolt-holes and women behind whose clothes he will hide .
Yes , Peshawur or Jehannum would suit us equally well . '
` Then what is the plan ? ' '
O fool , have I not told it a hundred times ?
Wait till he comes to lie down , and then one sure shot .
The trucks are between us and pursuit .
We have but to run back over the lines and go our way .
They will not see whence the shot came .
Wait here at least till the dawn .
What manner of fakir art thou , to shiver at a little watching ? '
` Oho ! '
thought Kim , behind close-shut eyes .
` Once again it is Mahbub .
Indeed a white stallion 's pedigree is not a good thing to peddle to Sahibs !
Or maybe Mahbub has been selling other news .
Now what is to do , Kim ?
I know not where Mahbub houses , and if he comes here before the dawn they will shoot him .
That would be no profit for thee , Kim .
And this is not a matter for the police .
That would be no profit for Mahbub ; and ' -- he giggled almost aloud -- ' I do not remember any lesson at Nucklao which will help me .
Allah !
Here is Kim and yonder are they .
First , then , Kim must wake and go away , so that they shall not suspect .
A bad dream wakes a man -- thus -- ' He threw the blanket off his face , and raised himself suddenly with the terrible , bubbling , meaningless yell of the Asiatic roused by nightmare .
` Urr-urr-urr-urr !
Ya-la-la-la-la !
Narain !
The churel !
The churel ! '
A churel is the peculiarly malignant ghost of a woman who has died in child-bed .
She haunts lonely roads , her feet are turned backwards on the ankles , and she leads men to torment .
Louder rose Kim 's quavering howl , till at last he leaped to his feet and staggered off sleepily , while the camp cursed him for waking them .
Some twenty yards farther up the line he lay down again , taking care that the whisperers should hear his grunts and groans as he recomposed himself .
After a few minutes he rolled towards the road and stole away into the thick darkness .
He paddled along swiftly till he came to a culvert , and dropped behind it , his chin on a level with the coping-stone .
Here he could command all the night-traffic , himself unseen .
Two or three carts passed , jingling out to the suburbs ; a coughing policeman and a hurrying foot-passenger or two who sang to keep off evil spirits .
Then rapped the shod feet of a horse .
` Ah !
This is more like Mahbub , ' thought Kim , as the beast shied at the little head above the culvert .
` Ohe ' , Mahbub Ali , ' he whispered , ` have a care ! '
The horse was reined back almost on its haunches , and forced towards the culvert .
` Never again , ' said Mahbub , ` will I take a shod horse for night-work .
They pick up all the bones and nails in the city . '
He stooped to lift its forefoot , and that brought his head within a foot of Kim 's .
` Down -- keep down , ' he muttered .
` The night is full of eyes . '
` Two men wait thy coming behind the horse-trucks .
They will shoot thee at thy lying down , because there is a price on thy head .
I heard , sleeping near the horses . '
` Didst thou see them ?
... Hold still , Sire of Devils ! '
This furiously to the horse .
` No . '
` Was one dressed belike as a fakir ? '
` One said to the other , `` What manner of fakir art thou , to shiver at a little watching ? '' '
` Good .
Go back to the camp and lie down .
I do not die tonight . '
Mahbub wheeled his horse and vanished .
Kim tore back down the ditch till he reached a point opposite his second resting-place , slipped across the road like a weasel , and re-coiled himself in the blanket .
` At least Mahbub knows , ' he thought contentedly .
` And certainly he spoke as one expecting it .
I do not think those two men will profit by tonight 's watch . '
An hour passed , and , with the best will in the world to keep awake all night , he slept deeply .
Now and again a night train roared along the metals within twenty feet of him ; but he had all the Oriental 's indifference to mere noise , and it did not even weave a dream through his slumber .
Mahbub was anything but asleep .
It annoyed him vehemently that people outside his tribe and unaffected by his casual amours should pursue him for the life .
His first and natural impulse was to cross the line lower down , work up again , and , catching his well-wishers from behind , summarily slay them .
Here , he reflected with sorrow , another branch of the Government , totally unconnected with Colonel Creighton , might demand explanations which would be hard to supply ; and he knew that south of the Border a perfectly ridiculous fuss is made about a corpse or so .
He had not been troubled in this way since he sent Kim to Umballa with the message , and hoped that suspicion had been finally diverted .
Then a most brilliant notion struck him .
` The English do eternally tell the truth , ' he said , ` therefore we of this country are eternally made foolish .
By Allah , I will tell the truth to an Englishman !
Of what use is the Government police if a poor Kabuli be robbed of his horses in their very trucks .
This is as bad as Peshawur !
I should lay a complaint at the station .
Better still , some young Sahib on the Railway !
They are zealous , and if they catch thieves it is remembered to their honour . '
He tied up his horse outside the station , and strode on to the platform .
` Hullo , Mahbub Ali ' said a young Assistant District Traffic Superintendent who was waiting to go down the line -- a tall , tow-haired , horsey youth in dingy white linen .
` What are you doing here ?
Selling weeds -- eh ? '
` No ; I am not troubled for my horses .
I come to look for Lutuf Ullah .
I have a truck-load up the line .
Could anyone take them out without the Railway 's knowledge ? '
` Should n't think so , Mahbub .
You can claim against us if they do . ' '
I have seen two men crouching under the wheels of one of the trucks nearly all night .
Fakirs do not steal horses , so I gave them no more thought .
I would find Lutuf Ullah , my partner . '
` The deuce you did ?
And you did n't bother your head about it ?
` Pon my word , it 's just almost as well that I met you .
What were they like , eh ? '
` They were only fakirs .
They will no more than take a little grain , perhaps , from one of the trucks .
There are many up the line .
The State will never miss the dole .
I came here seeking for my partner , Lutuf Ullah . '
` Never mind your partner .
Where are your horse-trucks ? ' '
A little to this side of the farthest place where they make lamps for the trains . '
-- ` The signal-box !
Yes . '
` And upon the rail nearest to the road upon the right-hand side -- looking up the line thus .
But as regards Lutuf Ullah -- a tall man with a broken nose , and a Persian greyhound Aie ! '
The boy had hurried off to wake up a young and enthusiastic policeman ; for , as he said , the Railway had suffered much from depredations in the goods-yard .
Mahbub Ali chuckled in his dyed beard .
` They will walk in their boots , making a noise , and then they will wonder why there are no fakirs .
They are very clever boys -- Barton Sahib and Young Sahib . '
He waited idly for a few minutes , expecting to see them hurry up the line girt for action .
A light engine slid through the station , and he caught a glimpse of young Barton in the cab . '
I did that child an injustice .
He is not altogether a fool , ' said Mahbub Ali .
` To take a fire-carriage for a thief is a new game ! '
When Mahbub Ali came to his camp in the dawn , no one thought it worth while to tell him any news of the night .
No one , at least , but one small horseboy , newly advanced to the great man 's service , whom Mahbub called to his tiny tent to assist in some packing .
` It is all known to me , ' whispered Kim , bending above saddlebags .
` Two Sahibs came up on a te-train .
I was running to and fro in the dark on this side of the trucks as the te-train moved up and down slowly .
They fell upon two men sitting under this truck -- Hajji , what shall I do with this lump of tobacco ?
Wrap it in paper and put it under the salt-bag ?
Yes -- and struck them down .
But one man struck at a Sahib with a fakir 's buck 's horn ' -LRB- Kim meant the conjoined black-buck horns , which are a fakir 's sole temporal weapon -RRB- -- ` the blood came .
So the other Sahib , first smiting his own man senseless , smote the stabber with a short gun which had rolled from the first man 's hand .
They all raged as though mad together . '
Mahbub smiled with heavenly resignation .
` No !
That is not so much dewanee -LSB- madness , or a case for the civil court -- the word can be punned upon both ways -RSB- as nizamut -LSB- a criminal case -RSB- .
A gun , sayest thou ?
Ten good years in jail . '
` Then they both lay still , but I think they were nearly dead when they were put on the te-train .
Their heads moved thus .
And there is much blood on the line .
Come and see ? ' '
I have seen blood before .
Jail is the sure place -- and assuredly they will give false names , and assuredly no man will find them for a long time .
They were unfriends of mine .
Thy fate and mine seem on one string .
What a tale for the healer of pearls !
Now swiftly with the saddle-bags and the cooking-platter .
We will take out the horses and away to Simla . '
Swiftly -- as Orientals understand speed -- with long explanations , with abuse and windy talk , carelessly , amid a hundred checks for little things forgotten , the untidy camp broke up and led the half-dozen stiff and fretful horses along the Kalka road in the fresh of the rain-swept dawn .
Kim , regarded as Mahbub Ali 's favourite by all who wished to stand well with the Pathan , was not called upon to work .
They strolled on by the easiest of stages , halting every few hours at a wayside shelter .
Very many Sahibs travel along the Kalka road ; and , as Mahbub Ali says , every young Sahib must needs esteem himself a judge of a horse , and , though he be over head in debt to the money-lender , must make as if to buy .
That was the reason that Sahib after Sahib , rolling along in a stage-carriage , would stop and open talk .
Some would even descend from their vehicles and feel the horses ' legs ; asking inane questions , or , through sheer ignorance of the vernacular , grossly insulting the imperturbable trader .
` When first I dealt with Sahibs , and that was when Colonel Soady Sahib was Governor of Fort Abazai and flooded the Commissioner 's camping-ground for spite , ' Mahbub confided to Kim as the boy filled his pipe under a tree , ' I did not know how greatly they were fools , and this made me wroth .
As thus -- , ' and he told Kim a tale of an expression , misused in all innocence , that doubled Kim up with mirth .
` Now I see , however , ' -- he exhaled smoke slowly -- ` that it is with them as with all men -- in certain matters they are wise , and in others most foolish .
Very foolish it is to use the wrong word to a stranger ; for though the heart may be clean of offence , how is the stranger to know that ?
He is more like to search truth with a dagger . '
` True .
True talk , ' said Kim solemnly .
` Fools speak of a cat when a woman is brought to bed , for instance .
I have heard them . '
` Therefore , in one situate as thou art , it particularly behoves thee to remember this with both kinds of faces .
Among Sahibs , never forgetting thou art a Sahib ; among the folk of Hind , always remembering thou art -- ' He paused , with a puzzled smile .
` What am I ?
Mussalman , Hindu , Jain , or Buddhist ?
That is a hard knot . '
` Thou art beyond question an unbeliever , and therefore thou wilt be damned .
So says my Law -- or I think it does .
But thou art also my Little Friend of all the World , and I love thee .
So says my heart .
This matter of creeds is like horseflesh .
The wise man knows horses are good -- that there is a profit to be made from all ; and for myself -- but that I am a good Sunni and hate the men of Tirah -- I could believe the same of all the Faiths .
Now manifestly a Kathiawar mare taken from the sands of her birthplace and removed to the west of Bengal founders -- nor is even a Balkh stallion -LRB- and there are no better horses than those of Balkh , were they not so heavy in the shoulder -RRB- of any account in the great Northern deserts beside the snow-camels I have seen .
Therefore I say in my heart the Faiths are like the horses .
Each has merit in its own country . '
` But my lama said altogether a different thing . '
` Oh , he is an old dreamer of dreams from Bhotiyal .
My heart is a little angry , Friend of all the World , that thou shouldst see such worth in a man so little known . '
` It is true , Hajji ; but that worth do I see , and to him my heart is drawn . '
` And his to thine , I hear .
Hearts are like horses .
They come and they go against bit or spur .
Shout Gul Sher Khan yonder to drive in that bay stallion 's pickets more firmly .
We do not want a horse-fight at every resting-stage , and the dun and the black will be locked in a little ... Now hear me .
Is it necessary to the comfort of thy heart to see that lama ? '
` It is one part of my bond , ' said Kim .
` If I do not see him , and if he is taken from me , I will go out of that madrissah in Nucklao and , and -- once gone , who is to find me again ? '
` It is true .
Never was colt held on a lighter heel-rope than thou . '
Mahbub nodded his head .
` Do not be afraid . '
Kim spoke as though he could have vanished on the moment .
` My lama has said that he will come to see me at the madrissah -- ' ' A beggar and his bowl in the presence of those young Sa -- ' ` Not all ! '
Kim cut in with a snort .
` Their eyes are blued and their nails are blackened with low-caste blood , many of them .
Sons of mehteranees -- brothers-in-law to the bhungi -LSB- sweeper -RSB- . '
We need not follow the rest of the pedigree ; but Kim made his little point clearly and without heat , chewing a piece of sugar-cane the while .
` Friend of all the World , ' said Mahbub , pushing over the pipe for the boy to clean , ' I have met many men , women , and boys , and not a few Sahibs .
I have never in all my days met such an imp as thou art . '
` And why ?
When I always tell thee the truth . '
` Perhaps the very reason , for this is a world of danger to honest men . '
Mahbub Ali hauled himself off the ground , girt in his belt , and went over to the horses .
` Or sell it ? '
There was that in the tone that made Mahbub halt and turn .
` What new devilry ? '
` Eight annas , and I will tell , ' said Kim , grinning .
` It touches thy peace . ' '
O Shaitan ! '
Mahbub gave the money .
` Rememberest thou the little business of the thieves in the dark , down yonder at Umballa ? '
` Seeing they sought my life , I have not altogether forgotten .
Why ? '
` Rememberest thou the Kashmir Serai ? ' '
I will twist thy ears in a moment -- Sahib . '
` No need -- Pathan .
Only , the second fakir , whom the Sahibs beat senseless , was the man who came to search thy bulkhead at Lahore .
I saw his face as they helped him on the engine .
The very same man . '
` Why didst thou not tell before ? '
` Oh , he will go to jail , and be safe for some years .
There is no need to tell more than is necessary at any one time .
Besides , I did not then need money for sweetmeats . '
` Allah kerim ! '
said Mahbub Ah .
` Wilt thou some day sell my head for a few sweetmeats if the fit takes thee ? '
Kim will remember till he dies that long , lazy journey from Umballa , through Kalka and the Pinjore Gardens near by , up to Simla .
A sudden spate in the Gugger River swept down one horse -LRB- the most valuable , be sure -RRB- , and nearly drowned Kim among the dancing boulders .
Farther up the road the horses were stampeded by a Government elephant , and being in high condition of grass food , it cost a day and a half to get them together again .
Then they met Sikandar Khan coming down with a few unsaleable screws -- remnants of his string -- and Mahbub , who has more of horse-coping in his little fingernail than Sikandar Khan in all his tents , must needs buy two of the worst , and that meant eight hours ' laborious diplomacy and untold tobacco .
But it was all pure delight -- the wandering road , climbing , dipping , and sweeping about the growing spurs ; the flush of the morning laid along the distant snows ; the branched cacti , tier upon tier on the stony hillsides ; the voices of a thousand water-channels ; the chatter of the monkeys ; the solemn deodars , climbing one after another with down-drooped branches ; the vista of the Plains rolled out far beneath them ; the incessant twanging of the tonga-horns and the wild rush of the led horses when a tonga swung round a curve ; the halts for prayers -LRB- Mahbub was very religious in dry-washings and bellowings when time did not press -RRB- ; the evening conferences by the halting-places , when camels and bullocks chewed solemnly together and the stolid drivers told the news of the Road -- all these things lifted Kim 's heart to song within him .
` But , when the singing and dancing is done , ' said Mahbub Ali , ` comes the Colonel Sahib 's , and that is not so sweet . ' '
A fair land -- a most beautiful land is this of Hind -- and the land of the Five Rivers is fairer than all , ' Kim half chanted .
` Into it I will go again if Mahbub Ali or the Colonel lift hand or foot against me .
Once gone , who shall find me ?
Look , Hajji , is yonder the city of Simla ?
Allah , what a city ! '
` My father 's brother , and he was an old man when Mackerson Sahib 's well was new at Peshawur , could recall when there were but two houses in it . '
He led the horses below the main road into the lower Simla bazar -- the crowded rabbit-warren that climbs up from the valley to the Town Hall at an angle of forty-five .
A man who knows his way there can defy all the police of India 's summer capital , so cunningly does veranda communicate with veranda , alley-way with alley-way , and bolt-hole with bolt-hole .
Here live those who minister to the wants of the glad city -- jhampanis who pull the pretty ladies ' ` rickshaws by night and gamble till the dawn ; grocers , oil-sellers , curio-vendors , firewood-dealers , priests , pickpockets , and native employees of the Government .
Here are discussed by courtesans the things which are supposed to be profoundest secrets of the India Council ; and here gather all the sub-sub-agents of half the Native States .
Here , too , Mahbub Ali rented a room , much more securely locked than his bulkhead at Lahore , in the house of a Mohammedan cattle-dealer .
It was a place of miracles , too , for there went in at twilight a Mohammedan horseboy , and there came out an hour later a Eurasian lad -- the Lucknow girl 's dye was of the best -- in badly-fitting shop-clothes . '
I have spoken with Creighton Sahib , ' quoth Mahbub Ali , ` and a second time has the Hand of Friendship averted the Whip of Calamity .
He says that thou hast altogether wasted sixty days upon the Road , and it is too late , therefore , to send thee to any Hill-school . ' '
I have said that my holidays are my own .
I do not go to school twice over .
That is one part of my bond . '
` The Colonel Sahib is not yet aware of that contract .
Thou art to lodge in Lurgan Sahib 's house till it is time to go again to Nucklao . ' '
I had sooner lodge with thee , Mahbub . '
` Thou dost not know the honour .
Lurgan Sahib himself asked for thee .
Thou wilt go up the hill and along the road atop , and there thou must forget for a while that thou hast ever seen or spoken to me , Mahbub Ali , who sells horses to Creighton Sahib , whom thou dost not know .
Remember this order . '
Kim nodded .
` Good , ' said he , ` and who is Lurgan Sahib ?
Nay ' -- he caught Mahbub 's sword-keen glance -- ` indeed I have never heard his name .
Is he by chance -- he lowered his voice -- ` one of us ? '
` What talk is this of us , Sahib ? '
Mahbub Ali returned , in the tone he used towards Europeans . '
I am a Pathan ; thou art a Sahib and the son of a Sahib .
Lurgan Sahib has a shop among the European shops .
All Simla knows it .
Ask there ... and , Friend of all the World , he is one to be obeyed to the last wink of his eyelashes .
Men say he does magic , but that should not touch thee .
Go up the hill and ask .
Here begins the Great Game . '
Chapter 9 S ' doaks was son of Yelth the wise -- Chief of the Raven clan .
Itswoot the Bear had him in care To make him a medicine-man .
He was quick and quicker to learn -- Bold and bolder to dare : He danced the dread Kloo-Kwallie Dance To tickle Itswoot the Bear !
Oregon Legend Kim flung himself whole-heartedly upon the next turn of the wheel .
He would be a Sahib again for a while .
In that idea , so soon as he had reached the broad road under Simla Town Hall , he cast about for one to impress .
A Hindu child , some ten years old , squatted under a lamp-post .
` Where is Mr Lurgan 's house ? '
demanded Kim . '
I do not understand English , ' was the answer , and Kim shifted his speech accordingly . '
I will show . '
Together they set off through the mysterious dusk , full of the noises of a city below the hillside , and the breath of a cool wind in deodar-crowned Jakko , shouldering the stars .
The house-lights , scattered on every level , made , as it were , a double firmament .
Some were fixed , others belonged to the ` rickshaws of the careless , open-spoken English folk , going out to dinner .
` It is here , ' said Kim 's guide , and halted in a veranda flush with the main road .
No door stayed them , but a curtain of beaded reeds that split up the lamplight beyond .
` He is come , ' said the boy , in a voice little louder than a sigh , and vanished .
Kim felt sure that the boy had been posted to guide him from the first , but , putting a bold face on it , parted the curtain .
A black-bearded man , with a green shade over his eyes , sat at a table , and , one by one , with short , white hands , picked up globules of light from a tray before him , threaded them on a glancing silken string , and hummed to himself the while .
Kim was conscious that beyond the circle of light the room was full of things that smelt like all the temples of all the East .
A whiff of musk , a puff of sandal-wood , and a breath of sickly jessamine-oil caught his opened nostrils . '
I am here , ' said Kim at last , speaking in the vernacular : the smells made him forget that he was to be a Sahib .
` Seventy-nine , eighty , eighty-one , ' the man counted to himself , stringing pearl after pearl so quickly that Kim could scarcely follow his fingers .
He slid off the green shade and looked fixedly at Kim for a full half-minute .
The pupils of the eye dilated and closed to pin-pricks , as if at will .
There was a fakir by the Taksali Gate who had just this gift and made money by it , especially when cursing silly women .
Kim stared with interest .
His disreputable friend could further twitch his ears , almost like a goat , and Kim was disappointed that this new man could not imitate him .
` Do not be afraid , ' said Lurgan Sahib suddenly .
` Why should I fear ? '
` Thou wilt sleep here tonight , and stay with me till it is time to go again to Nucklao .
It is an order . '
` It is an order , ' Kim repeated .
` But where shall I sleep ? '
` Here , in this room . '
Lurgan Sahib waved his hand towards the darkness behind him .
` So be it , ' said Kim composedly .
` Now ? '
He nodded and held the lamp above his head .
As the light swept them , there leaped out from the walls a collection of Tibetan devil-dance masks , hanging above the fiend-embroidered draperies of those ghastly functions -- horned masks , scowling masks , and masks of idiotic terror .
In a corner , a Japanese warrior , mailed and plumed , menaced him with a halberd , and a score of lances and khandas and kuttars gave back the unsteady gleam .
But what interested Kim more than all these things -- he had seen devil-dance masks at the Lahore Museum -- was a glimpse of the soft-eyed Hindu child who had left him in the doorway , sitting cross-legged under the table of pearls with a little smile on his scarlet lips . '
I think that Lurgan Sahib wishes to make me afraid .
And I am sure that that devil 's brat below the table wishes to see me afraid .
` This place , ' he said aloud , ` is like a Wonder House .
Where is my bed ? '
Lurgan Sahib pointed to a native quilt in a corner by the loathsome masks , picked up the lamp , and left the room black .
` Was that Lurgan Sahib ? '
Kim asked as he cuddled down .
No answer .
He could hear the Hindu boy breathing , however , and , guided by the sound , crawled across the floor , and cuffed into the darkness , crying : ` Give answer , devil !
Is this the way to lie to a Sahib ? '
From the darkness he fancied he could hear the echo of a chuckle .
It could not be his soft-fleshed companion , because he was weeping .
So Kim lifted up his voice and called aloud : ` Lurgan Sahib !
O Lurgan Sahib !
Is it an order that thy servant does not speak to me ? '
` It is an order . '
The voice came from behind him and he started .
` Very good .
But remember , ' he muttered , as he resought the quilt , ' I will beat thee in the morning .
I do not love Hindus . '
That was no cheerful night ; the room being overfull of voices and music .
Kim was waked twice by someone calling his name .
The second time he set out in search , and ended by bruising his nose against a box that certainly spoke with a human tongue , but in no sort of human accent .
It seemed to end in a tin trumpet and to be joined by wires to a smaller box on the floor -- so far , at least , as he could judge by touch .
And the voice , very hard and whirring , came out of the trumpet .
Kim rubbed his nose and grew furious , thinking , as usual , in Hindi .
` This with a beggar from the bazar might be good , but -- I am a Sahib and the son of a Sahib and , which is twice as much more beside , a student of Nucklao .
Yess ' -LRB- here he turned to English -RRB- , ' a boy of St Xavier 's .
Damn Mr Lurgan 's eyes !
-- It is some sort of machinery like a sewing-machine .
Oh , it is a great cheek of him -- we are not frightened that way at Lucknow -- No ! '
Then in Hindi : ` But what does he gain ?
He is only a trader -- I am in his shop .
But Creighton Sahib is a Colonel -- and I think Creighton Sahib gave orders that it should be done .
How I will beat that Hindu in the morning !
What is this ? '
The trumpet-box was pouring out a string of the most elaborate abuse that even Kim had ever heard , in a high uninterested voice , that for a moment lifted the short hairs of his neck .
When the vile thing drew breath , Kim was reassured by the soft , sewing-machine-like whirr .
` Chup !
-LSB- Be still -RSB- ' he cried , and again he heard a chuckle that decided him .
` Chup -- or I break your head . '
The box took no heed .
Kim wrenched at the tin trumpet and something lifted with a click .
He had evidently raised a lid .
If there were a devil inside , now was its time , for -- he sniffed -- thus did the sewing-machines of the bazar smell .
He would clean that shaitan .
He slipped off his jacket , and plunged it into the box 's mouth .
Something long and round bent under the pressure , there was a whirr and the voice stopped -- as voices must if you ram a thrice-doubled coat on to the wax cylinder and into the works of an expensive phonograph .
Kim finished his slumbers with a serene mind .
In the morning he was aware of Lurgan Sahib looking down on him .
` Oah ! '
said Kim , firmly resolved to cling to his Sahib-dom .
` There was a box in the night that gave me bad talk .
So I stopped it .
Was it your box ? '
The man held out his hand .
` Shake hands , O'Hara , ' he said .
` Yes , it was my box .
I keep such things because my friends the Rajahs like them .
That one is broken , but it was cheap at the price .
Yes , my friends , the Kings , are very fond of toys -- and so am I sometimes . '
Kim looked him over out of the corners of his eyes .
He was a Sahib in that he wore Sahib 's clothes ; the accent of his Urdu , the intonation of his English , showed that he was anything but a Sahib .
He seemed to understand what moved in Kim 's mind ere the boy opened his mouth , and he took no pains to explain himself as did Father Victor or the Lucknow masters .
Sweetest of all -- he treated Kim as an equal on the Asiatic side . '
I am sorry you can not beat my boy this morning .
He says he will kill you with a knife or poison .
He is jealous , so I have put him in the corner and I shall not speak to him today .
He has just tried to kill me .
You must help me with the breakfast .
He is almost too jealous to trust , just now . '
Now a genuine imported Sahib from England would have made a great to-do over this tale .
Lurgan Sahib stated it as simply as Mahbub Ali was used to record his little affairs in the North .
The back veranda of the shop was built out over the sheer hillside , and they looked down into their neighbours ' chimney-pots , as is the custom of Simla .
But even more than the purely Persian meal cooked by Lurgan Sahib with his own hands , the shop fascinated Kim .
The Lahore Museum was larger , but here were more wonders -- ghost-daggers and prayer-wheels from Tibet ; turquoise and raw amber necklaces ; green jade bangles ; curiously packed incense-sticks in jars crusted over with raw garnets ; the devil-masks of overnight and a wall full of peacock-blue draperies ; gilt figures of Buddha , and little portable lacquer altars ; Russian samovars with turquoises on the lid ; egg-shell china sets in quaint octagonal cane boxes ; yellow ivory crucifixes -- from Japan of all places in the world , so Lurgan Sahib said ; carpets in dusty bales , smelling atrociously , pushed back behind torn and rotten screens of geometrical work ; Persian water-jugs for the hands after meals ; dull copper incense-burners neither Chinese nor Persian , with friezes of fantastic devils running round them ; tarnished silver belts that knotted like raw hide ; hairpins of jade , ivory , and plasma ; arms of all sorts and kinds , and a thousand other oddments were cased , or piled , or merely thrown into the room , leaving a clear space only round the rickety deal table , where Lurgan Sahib worked .
` Those things are nothing , ' said his host , following Kim 's glance . '
I buy them because they are pretty , and sometimes I sell -- if I like the buyer 's look .
My work is on the table -- some of it . '
It blazed in the morning light -- all red and blue and green flashes , picked out with the vicious blue-white spurt of a diamond here and there .
Kim opened his eyes .
` Oh , they are quite well , those stones .
It will not hurt them to take the sun .
Besides , they are cheap .
But with sick stones it is very different . '
He piled Kim 's plate anew .
` There is no one but me can doctor a sick pearl and re-blue turquoises .
I grant you opals -- any fool can cure an opal -- but for a sick pearl there is only me .
Suppose I were to die !
Then there would be no one ... Oh no !
You can not do anything with jewels .
It will be quite enough if you understand a little about the Turquoise -- some day . '
He moved to the end of the veranda to refill the heavy , porous clay water-jug from the filter .
` Do you want drink ? '
Kim nodded .
Lurgan Sahib , fifteen feet off , laid one hand on the jar .
Next instant , it stood at Kim 's elbow , full to within half an inch of the brim -- the white cloth only showing , by a small wrinkle , where it had slid into place .
` Wah ! '
said Kim in most utter amazement .
` That is magic . '
Lurgan Sahib 's smile showed that the compliment had gone home .
` Throw it back . '
` It will break . ' '
I say , throw it back . '
Kim pitched it at random .
It fell short and crashed into fifty pieces , while the water dripped through the rough veranda boarding . '
I said it would break . '
` All one .
Look at it .
Look at the largest piece . '
That lay with a sparkle of water in its curve , as it were a star on the floor .
Kim looked intently .
Lurgan Sahib laid one hand gently on the nape of his neck , stroked it twice or thrice , and whispered : ` Look !
It shall come to life again , piece by piece .
First the big piece shall join itself to two others on the right and the left -- on the right and the left .
Look ! '
To save his life , Kim could not have turned his head .
The light touch held him as in a vice , and his blood tingled pleasantly through him .
There was one large piece of the jar where there had been three , and above them the shadowy outline of the entire vessel .
He could see the veranda through it , but it was thickening and darkening with each beat of his pulse .
Yet the jar -- how slowly the thoughts came !
-- the jar had been smashed before his eyes .
Another wave of prickling fire raced down his neck , as Lurgan Sahib moved his hand .
` Look !
It is coming into shape , ' said Lurgan Sahib .
So far Kim had been thinking in Hindi , but a tremor came on him , and with an effort like that of a swimmer before sharks , who hurls himself half out of the water , his mind leaped up from a darkness that was swallowing it and took refuge in -- the multiplication-table in English !
` Look !
It is coming into shape , ' whispered Lurgan Sahib .
The jar had been smashed -- yess , smashed -- not the native word , he would not think of that -- but smashed -- into fifty pieces , and twice three was six , and thrice three was nine , and four times three was twelve .
He clung desperately to the repetition .
The shadow-outline of the jar cleared like a mist after rubbing eyes .
There were the broken shards ; there was the spilt water drying in the sun , and through the cracks of the veranda showed , all ribbed , the white house-wall below -- and thrice twelve was thirty-six !
` Look !
Is it coming into shape ? '
asked Lurgan Sahib .
` But it is smashed -- smashed , ' he gasped -- Lurgan Sahib had been muttering softly for the last half-minute .
Kim wrenched his head aside .
` Look !
Dekho !
It is there as it was there . '
` It is there as it was there , ' said Lurgan , watching Kim closely while the boy rubbed his neck .
` But you are the first of many who has ever seen it so . '
He wiped his broad forehead .
` Was that more magic ? '
Kim asked suspiciously .
The tingle had gone from his veins ; he felt unusually wide awake .
` No , that was not magic .
It was only to see if there was -- a flaw in a jewel .
Sometimes very fine jewels will fly all to pieces if a man holds them in his hand , and knows the proper way .
That is why one must be careful before one sets them .
Tell me , did you see the shape of the pot ? '
` For a little time .
It began to grow like a flower from the ground . '
` And then what did you do ?
I mean , how did you think ? '
` Oah !
I knew it was broken , and so , I think , that was what I thought -- and it was broken . '
` Hm !
Has anyone ever done that same sort of magic to you before ? '
` If it was , ' said Kim ` do you think I should let it again ?
I should run away . '
` And now you are not afraid -- eh ? '
` Not now . '
Lurgan Sahib looked at him more closely than ever . '
I shall ask Mahbub Ali -- not now , but some day later , ' he muttered . '
I am pleased with you -- yes ; and I am pleased with you -- no .
You are the first that ever saved himself .
I wish I knew what it was that ... But you are right .
You should not tell that -- not even to me . '
He turned into the dusky gloom of the shop , and sat down at the table , rubbing his hands softly .
A small , husky sob came from behind a pile of carpets .
It was the Hindu child obediently facing towards the wall .
His thin shoulders worked with grief .
` Ah !
He is jealous , so jealous .
I wonder if he will try to poison me again in my breakfast , and make me cook it twice .
` Kubbee -- kubbee nahin -LSB- Never -- never .
No ! -RSB- '
, came the broken answer .
` And whether he will kill this other boy ? '
` Kubbee -- kubbee nahin . '
` What do you think he will do ? '
He turned suddenly on Kim .
` Oah !
I do not know .
Let him go , perhaps .
Why did he want to poison you ? '
` Because he is so fond of me .
Suppose you were fond of someone , and you saw someone come , and the man you were fond of was more pleased with him than he was with you , what would you do ? '
Kim thought .
Lurgan repeated the sentence slowly in the vernacular . '
I should not poison that man , ' said Kim reflectively , ` but I should beat that boy -- if that boy was fond of my man .
But first , I would ask that boy if it were true . '
` Ah !
He thinks everyone must be fond of me . '
` Then I think he is a fool . '
` Hearest thou ? '
said Lurgan Sahib to the shaking shoulders .
` The Sahib 's son thinks thou art a little fool .
Come out , and next time thy heart is troubled , do not try white arsenic quite so openly .
Surely the Devil Dasim was lord of our table-cloth that day !
It might have made me ill , child , and then a stranger would have guarded the jewels .
Come ! '
The child , heavy-eyed with much weeping , crept out from behind the bale and flung himself passionately at Lurgan Sahib 's feet , with an extravagance of remorse that impressed even Kim . '
I will look into the ink-pools -- I will faithfully guard the jewels !
Oh , my Father and my Mother , send him away ! '
He indicated Kim with a backward jerk of his bare heel .
` Not yet -- not yet .
In a little while he will go away again .
But now he is at school -- at a new madrissah -- and thou shalt be his teacher .
Play the Play of the Jewels against him .
I will keep tally . '
The child dried his tears at once , and dashed to the back of the shop , whence he returned with a copper tray .
` Give me ! '
he said to Lurgan Sahib .
` Let them come from thy hand , for he may say that I knew them before . '
` Gently -- gently , ' the man replied , and from a drawer under the table dealt a half-handful of clattering trifles into the tray .
` Now , ' said the child , waving an old newspaper .
` Look on them as long as thou wilt , stranger .
Count and , if need be , handle .
One look is enough for me . '
He turned his back proudly .
` But what is the game ? '
` When thou hast counted and handled and art sure that thou canst remember them all , I cover them with this paper , and thou must tell over the tally to Lurgan Sahib .
I will write mine . '
` Oah ! '
The instinct of competition waked in his breast .
He bent over the tray .
There were but fifteen stones on it .
` That is easy , ' he said after a minute .
The child slipped the paper over the winking jewels and scribbled in a native account-book .
` There are under that paper five blue stones -- one big , one smaller , and three small , ' said Kim , all in haste .
` There are four green stones , and one with a hole in it ; there is one yellow stone that I can see through , and one like a pipe-stem .
There are two red stones , and -- and -- I made the count fifteen , but two I have forgotten .
No !
Give me time .
One was of ivory , little and brownish ; and -- and -- give me time ... ' ` One -- two ' -- Lurgan Sahib counted him out up to ten .
Kim shook his head .
` Hear my count ! '
the child burst in , trilling with laughter .
` First , are two flawed sapphires -- one of two ruttees and one of four as I should judge .
The four-ruttee sapphire is chipped at the edge .
There is one Turkestan turquoise , plain with black veins , and there are two inscribed -- one with a Name of God in gilt , and the other being cracked across , for it came out of an old ring , I can not read .
We have now all five blue stones .
Four flawed emeralds there are , but one is drilled in two places , and one is a little carven - ' ` Their weights ? '
said Lurgan Sahib impassively .
` Three -- five -- five -- and four ruttees as I judge it .
There is one piece of old greenish pipe amber , and a cut topaz from Europe .
There is one ruby of Burma , of two ruttees , without a flaw , and there is a balas-ruby , flawed , of two ruttees .
There is a carved ivory from China representing a rat sucking an egg ; and there is last -- ah ha !
-- a ball of crystal as big as a bean set on a gold leaf . '
He clapped his hands at the close .
` He is thy master , ' said Lurgan Sahib , smiling .
` Huh !
He knew the names of the stones , ' said Kim , flushing .
` Try again !
With common things such as he and I both know . '
They heaped the tray again with odds and ends gathered from the shop , and even the kitchen , and every time the child won , till Kim marvelled .
` Bind my eyes -- let me feel once with my fingers , and even then I will leave thee opened-eyed behind , ' he challenged .
Kim stamped with vexation when the lad made his boast good .
` If it were men -- or horses , ' he said , ' I could do better .
This playing with tweezers and knives and scissors is too little . '
` Learn first -- teach later , ' said Lurgan Sahib .
` Is he thy master ? '
` Truly .
But how is it done ? '
` By doing it many times over till it is done perfectly -- for it is worth doing . '
The Hindu boy , in highest feather , actually patted Kim on the back .
` Do not despair , ' he said . '
I myself will teach thee . '
` And I will see that thou art well taught , ' said Lurgan Sahib , still speaking in the vernacular , ` for except my boy here -- it was foolish of him to buy so much white arsenic when , if he had asked , I could have given it -- except my boy here I have not in a long time met with one better worth teaching .
And there are ten days more ere thou canst return to Lucknao where they teach nothing -- at the long price .
We shall , I think , be friends . '
They were a most mad ten days , but Kim enjoyed himself too much to reflect on their craziness .
In the morning they played the Jewel Game -- sometimes with veritable stones , sometimes with piles of swords and daggers , sometimes with photo-graphs of natives .
Through the afternoons he and the Hindu boy would mount guard in the shop , sitting dumb behind a carpet-bale or a screen and watching Mr Lurgan 's many and very curious visitors .
There were small Rajahs , escorts coughing in the veranda , who came to buy curiosities -- such as phonographs and mechanical toys .
There were ladies in search of necklaces , and men , it seemed to Kim -- but his mind may have been vitiated by early training -- in search of the ladies ; natives from independent and feudatory Courts whose ostensible business was the repair of broken necklaces -- rivers of light poured out upon the table -- but whose true end seemed to be to raise money for angry Maharanees or young Rajahs .
There were Babus to whom Lurgan Sahib talked with austerity and authority , but at the end of each interview he gave them money in coined silver and currency notes .
There were occasional gatherings of long-coated theatrical natives who discussed metaphysics in English and Bengali , to Mr Lurgan 's great edification .
He was always interested in religions .
At the end of the day , Kim and the Hindu boy -- whose name varied at Lurgan 's pleasure -- were expected to give a detailed account of all that they had seen and heard -- their view of each man 's character , as shown in his face , talk , and manner , and their notions of his real errand .
After dinner , Lurgan Sahib 's fancy turned more to what might be called dressing-up , in which game he took a most informing interest .
He could paint faces to a marvel ; with a brush-dab here and a line there changing them past recognition .
The shop was full of all manner of dresses and turbans , and Kim was apparelled variously as a young Mohammedan of good family , an oilman , and once -- which was a joyous evening -- as the son of an Oudh landholder in the fullest of full dress .
Lurgan Sahib had a hawk 's eye to detect the least flaw in the make-up ; and lying on a worn teak-wood couch , would explain by the half-hour together how such and such a caste talked , or walked , or coughed , or spat , or sneezed , and , since ` hows ' matter little in this world , the ` why ' of everything .
The Hindu child played this game clumsily .
That little mind , keen as an icicle where tally of jewels was concerned , could not temper itself to enter another 's soul ; but a demon in Kim woke up and sang with joy as he put on the changing dresses , and changed speech and gesture therewith .
Carried away by enthusiasm , he volunteered to show Lurgan Sahib one evening how the disciples of a certain caste of fakir , old Lahore acquaintances , begged doles by the roadside ; and what sort of language he would use to an Englishman , to a Punjabi farmer going to a fair , and to a woman without a veil .
Lurgan Sahib laughed immensely , and begged Kim to stay as he was , immobile for half an hour -- cross-legged , ash-smeared , and wild-eyed , in the back room .
At the end of that time entered a hulking , obese Babu whose stockinged legs shook with fat , and Kim opened on him with a shower of wayside chaff .
Lurgan Sahib -- this annoyed Kim -- watched the Babu and not the play . '
I think , ' said the Babu heavily , lighting a cigarette , ' I am of opeenion that it is most extraordinary and effeecient performance .
Except that you had told me I should have opined that -- that -- that you were pulling my legs .
How soon can he become approximately effeecient chain-man ?
Because then I shall indent for him . '
` That is what he must learn at Lucknow . '
` Then order him to be jolly-dam ' - quick .
Good-night , Lurgan . '
The Babu swung out with the gait of a bogged cow .
When they were telling over the day 's list of visitors , Lurgan Sahib asked Kim who he thought the man might be .
` God knows ! '
said Kim cheerily .
The tone might almost have deceived Mahbub Ali , but it failed entirely with the healer of sick pearls .
` That is true .
God , He knows ; but I wish to know what you think . '
Kim glanced sideways at his companion , whose eye had a way of compelling truth .
` I -- I think he will want me when I come from the school , but ' -- confidentially , as Lurgan Sahib nodded approval -- ' I do not understand how he can wear many dresses and talk many tongues . '
` Thou wilt understand many things later .
He is a writer of tales for a certain Colonel .
His honour is great only in Simla , and it is noticeable that he has no name , but only a number and a letter -- that is a custom among us . '
` And is there a price upon his head too -- as upon Mah -- all the others ? '
` Not yet ; but if a boy rose up who is now sitting here and went -- look , the door is open !
-- as far as a certain house with a red-painted veranda , behind that which was the old theatre in the Lower Bazar , and whispered through the shutters : `` Hurree Chunder Mookerjee bore the bad news of last month '' , that boy might take away a belt full of rupees . '
` How many ? '
said Kim promptly .
` Five hundred -- a thousand -- as many as he might ask for . '
` Good .
And for how long might such a boy live after the news was told ? '
He smiled merrily at Lurgan 's Sahib 's very beard .
` Ah !
That is to be well thought of .
Perhaps if he were very clever , he might live out the day -- but not the night .
By no means the night . '
` Then what is the Babu 's pay if so much is put upon his head ? '
` Eighty -- perhaps a hundred -- perhaps a hundred and fifty rupees ; but the pay is the least part of the work .
From time to time , God causes men to be born -- and thou art one of them -- who have a lust to go abroad at the risk of their lives and discover news -- today it may be of far-off things , tomorrow of some hidden mountain , and the next day of some near-by men who have done a foolishness against the State .
These souls are very few ; and of these few , not more than ten are of the best .
Among these ten I count the Babu , and that is curious .
How great , therefore , and desirable must be a business that brazens the heart of a Bengali ! '
` True .
But the days go slowly for me .
I am yet a boy , and it is only within two months I learned to write Angrezi .
Even now I can not read it well .
And there are yet years and years and long years before I can be even a chain-man . '
` Have patience , Friend of all the World ' -- Kim started at the title .
` Would I had a few of the years that so irk thee .
I have proved thee in several small ways .
This will not be forgotten when I make my report to the Colonel Sahib . '
Then , changing suddenly into English with a deep laugh : ` By Jove !
O'Hara , I think there is a great deal in you ; but you must not become proud and you must not talk .
You must go back to Lucknow and be a good little boy and mind your book , as the English say , and perhaps , next holidays if you care , you can come back to me ! '
Kim 's face fell .
` Oh , I mean if you like .
I know where you want to go . '
Four days later a seat was booked for Kim and his small trunk at the rear of a Kalka tonga .
His companion was the whale-like Babu , who , with a fringed shawl wrapped round his head , and his fat openwork-stockinged left leg tucked under him , shivered and grunted in the morning chill .
` How comes it that this man is one of us ? '
thought Kim considering the jelly back as they jolted down the road ; and the reflection threw him into most pleasant day-dreams .
Lurgan Sahib had given him five rupees -- a splendid sum -- as well as the assurance of his protection if he worked .
Unlike Mahbub , Lurgan Sahib had spoken most explicitly of the reward that would follow obedience , and Kim was content .
If only , like the Babu , he could enjoy the dignity of a letter and a number -- and a price upon his head !
Some day he would be all that and more .
Some day he might be almost as great as Mahbub Ali !
The housetops of his search should be half India ; he would follow Kings and Ministers , as in the old days he had followed vakils and lawyers ' touts across Lahore city for Mahbub Ali 's sake .
Meantime , there was the present , and not at all unpleasant , fact of St Xavier 's immediately before him .
There would be new boys to condescend to , and there would be tales of holiday adventures to hear .
Young Martin , son of the tea-planter at Manipur , had boasted that he would go to war , with a rifle , against the head-hunters .
That might be , but it was certain young Martin had not been blown half across the forecourt of a Patiala palace by an explosion of fireworks ; nor had he ... Kim fell to telling himself the story of his own adventures through the last three months .
He could paralyse St Xavier 's -- even the biggest boys who shaved -- with the recital , were that permitted .
But it was , of course , out of the question .
There would be a price upon his head in good time , as Lurgan Sahib had assured him ; and if he talked foolishly now , not only would that price never be set , but Colonel Creighton would cast him off -- and he would be left to the wrath of Lurgan Sahib and Mahbub Ali -- for the short space of life that would remain to him .
` So I should lose Delhi for the sake of a fish , ' was his proverbial philosophy .
It behoved him to forget his holidays -LRB- there would always remain the fun of inventing imaginary adventures -RRB- and , as Lurgan Sahib had said , to work .
Of all the boys hurrying back to St Xavier 's , from Sukkur in the sands to Galle beneath the palms , none was so filled with virtue as Kimball O'Hara , jiggeting down to Umballa behind Hurree Chunder Mookerjee , whose name on the books of one section of the Ethnological Survey was R. 17 .
And if additional spur were needed , the Babu supplied it .
After a huge meal at Kalka , he spoke uninterruptedly .
Was Kim going to school ?
Then he , an M A of Calcutta University , would explain the advantages of education .
There were marks to be gained by due attention to Latin and Wordsworth 's Excursion -LRB- all this was Greek to Kim -RRB- .
French , too was vital , and the best was to be picked up in Chandernagore a few miles from Calcutta .
Also a man might go far , as he himself had done , by strict attention to plays called Lear and Julius Caesar , both much in demand by examiners .
Lear was not so full of historical allusions as Julius Caesar ; the book cost four annas , but could be bought second-hand in Bow Bazar for two .
Still more important than Wordsworth , or the eminent authors , Burke and Hare , was the art and science of mensuration .
A boy who had passed his examination in these branches -- for which , by the way , there were no cram-books -- could , by merely marching over a country with a compass and a level and a straight eye , carry away a picture of that country which might be sold for large sums in coined silver .
But as it was occasionally inexpedient to carry about measuring-chains a boy would do well to know the precise length of his own foot-pace , so that when he was deprived of what Hurree Chunder called adventitious aids ' he might still tread his distances .
To keep count of thousands of paces , Hurree Chunder 's experience had shown him nothing more valuable than a rosary of eighty-one or a hundred and eight beads , for ` it was divisible and sub-divisible into many multiples and sub-multiples ' .
Through the volleying drifts of English , Kim caught the general trend of the talk , and it interested him very much .
Here was a new craft that a man could tuck away in his head and by the look of the large wide world unfolding itself before him , it seemed that the more a man knew the better for him .
Said the Babu when he had talked for an hour and a half ' I hope some day to enjoy your offeecial acquaintance .
Ad interim , if I may be pardoned that expression , I shall give you this betel-box , which is highly valuable article and cost me two rupees only four years ago . '
It was a cheap , heart-shaped brass thing with three compartments for carrying the eternal betel-nut , lime and pan-leaf ; but it was filled with little tabloid-bottles .
` That is reward of merit for your performance in character of that holy man .
You see , you are so young you think you will last for ever and not take care of your body .
It is great nuisance to go sick in the middle of business .
I am fond of drugs myself , and they are handy to cure poor people too .
These are good Departmental drugs -- quinine and so on .
I give it you for souvenir .
Now good-bye .
I have urgent private business here by the roadside . '
He slipped out noiselessly as a cat , on the Umballa road , hailed a passing cart and jingled away , while Kim , tongue-tied , twiddled the brass betel-box in his hands .
The record of a boy 's education interests few save his parents , and , as you know , Kim was an orphan .
It is written in the books of St Xavier 's in Partibus that a report of Kim 's progress was forwarded at the end of each term to Colonel Creighton and to Father Victor , from whose hands duly came the money for his schooling .
It is further recorded in the same books that he showed a great aptitude for mathematical studies as well as map-making , and carried away a prize -LRB- The Life of Lord Lawrence , tree-calf , two vols. , nine rupees , eight annas -RRB- for proficiency therein ; and the same term played in St Xavier 's eleven against the Alighur Mohammedan College , his age being fourteen years and ten months .
He was also re-vaccinated -LRB- from which we may assume that there had been another epidemic of smallpox at Lucknow -RRB- about the same time .
Pencil notes on the edge of an old muster-roll record that he was punished several times for ` conversing with improper persons ' , and it seems that he was once sentenced to heavy pains for ` absenting himself for a day in the company of a street beggar ' .
That was when he got over the gate and pleaded with the lama through a whole day down the banks of the Gumti to accompany him on the Road next holidays -- for one month -- for a little week ; and the lama set his face as a flint against it , averring that the time had not yet come .
Kim 's business , said the old man as they ate cakes together , was to get all the wisdom of the Sahibs and then he would see .
The Hand of Friendship must in some way have averted the Whip of Calamity , for six weeks later Kim seems to have passed an examination in elementary surveying ` with great credit ' , his age being fifteen years and eight months .
From this date the record is silent .
His name does not appear in the year 's batch of those who entered for the subordinate Survey of India , but against it stand the words ` removed on appointment . '
Several times in those three years , cast up at the Temple of the Tirthankars in Benares the lama , a little thinner and a shade yellower , if that were possible , but gentle and untainted as ever .
Sometimes it was from the South that he came -- from south of Tuticorin , whence the wonderful fire-boats go to Ceylon where are priests who know Pali ; sometimes it was from the wet green West and the thousand cotton-factory chimneys that ring Bombay ; and once from the North , where he had doubled back eight hundred miles to talk for a day with the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House .
He would stride to his cell in the cool , cut marble -- the priests of the Temple were good to the old man , -- wash off the dust of travel , make prayer , and depart for Lucknow , well accustomed now to the way of the rail , in a third-class carriage .
Returning , it was noticeable , as his friend the Seeker pointed out to the head-priest , that he ceased for a while to mourn the loss of his River , or to draw wondrous pictures of the Wheel of Life , but preferred to talk of the beauty and wisdom of a certain mysterious chela whom no man of the Temple had ever seen .
Yes , he had followed the traces of the Blessed Feet throughout all India .
-LRB- The Curator has still in his possession a most marvellous account of his wanderings and meditations . -RRB-
There remained nothing more in life but to find the River of the Arrow .
Yet it was shown to him in dreams that it was a matter not to be undertaken with any hope of success unless that seeker had with him the one chela appointed to bring the event to a happy issue , and versed in great wisdom -- such wisdom as white-haired Keepers of Images possess .
For example -LRB- here came out the snuff-gourd , and the kindly Jain priests made haste to be silent -RRB- : ` Long and long ago , when Devadatta was King of Benares -- let all listen to the Tataka !
-- an elephant was captured for a time by the king 's hunters and ere he broke free , beringed with a grievous legiron .
This he strove to remove with hate and frenzy in his heart , and hurrying up and down the forests , besought his brother-elephants to wrench it asunder .
One by one , with their strong trunks , they tried and failed .
At the last they gave it as their opinion that the ring was not to be broken by any bestial power .
And in a thicket , new-born , wet with moisture of birth , lay a day-old calf of the herd whose mother had died .
The fettered elephant , forgetting his own agony , said : `` If I do not help this suckling it will perish under our feet . ''
So he stood above the young thing , making his legs buttresses against the uneasily moving herd ; and he begged milk of a virtuous cow , and the calf throve , and the ringed elephant was the calf 's guide and defence .
Now the days of an elephant -- let all listen to the Tataka !
-- are thirty-five years to his full strength , and through thirty-five Rains the ringed elephant befriended the younger , and all the while the fetter ate into the flesh .
` Then one day the young elephant saw the half-buried iron , and turning to the elder said : `` What is this ? ''
`` It is even my sorrow , '' said he who had befriended him .
Then that other put out his trunk and in the twinkling of an eyelash abolished the ring , saying : `` The appointed time has come . ''
So the virtuous elephant who had waited temperately and done kind acts was relieved , at the appointed time , by the very calf whom he had turned aside to cherish -- let all listen to the Tataka !
for the Elephant was Ananda , and the Calf that broke the ring was none other than The Lord Himself ... ' Then he would shake his head benignly , and over the ever-clicking rosary point out how free that elephant-calf was from the sin of pride .
He was as humble as a chela who , seeing his master sitting in the dust outside the Gates of Learning , over-leapt the gates -LRB- though they were locked -RRB- and took his master to his heart in the presence of the proud-stomached city .
Rich would be the reward of such a master and such a chela when the time came for them to seek freedom together !
So did the lama speak , coming and going across India as softly as a bat .
A sharp-tongued old woman in a house among the fruit-trees behind Saharunpore honoured him as the woman honoured the prophet , but his chamber was by no means upon the wall .
In an apartment of the forecourt overlooked by cooing doves he would sit , while she laid aside her useless veil and chattered of spirits and fiends of Kulu , of grandchildren unborn , and of the free-tongued brat who had talked to her in the resting-place .
Once , too , he strayed alone from the Grand Trunk Road below Umballa to the very village whose priest had tried to drug him ; but the kind Heaven that guards lamas sent him at twilight through the crops , absorbed and unsuspicious , to the Rissaldar 's door .
Here was like to have been a grave misunderstanding , for the old soldier asked him why the Friend of the Stars had gone that way only six days before .
` That may not be , ' said the lama .
` He has gone back to his own people . '
` He sat in that corner telling a hundred merry tales five nights ago , ' his host insisted .
` True , he vanished somewhat suddenly in the dawn after foolish talk with my granddaughter .
He grows apace , but he is the same Friend of the Stars as brought me true word of the war .
Have ye parted ? '
` Yes -- and no , ' the lama replied .
` We -- we have not altogether parted , but the time is not ripe that we should take the Road together .
He acquires wisdom in another place .
We must wait . '
` All one -- but if it were not the boy how did he come to speak so continually of thee ? '
` And what said he ? '
asked the lama eagerly .
` Sweet words -- an hundred thousand -- that thou art his father and mother and such all .
Pity that he does not take the Qpeen 's service .
He is fearless . '
This news amazed the lama , who did not then know how religiously Kim kept to the contract made with Mahbub Ali , and perforce ratified by Colonel Creighton ... ` There is no holding the young pony from the game , ' said the horse-dealer when the Colonel pointed out that vagabonding over India in holiday time was absurd .
` If permission be refused to go and come as he chooses , he will make light of the refusal .
Then who is to catch him ?
Colonel Sahib , only once in a thousand years is a horse born so well fitted for the game as this our colt .
And we need men . '
Chapter 10 Your tiercel 's too long at hack , Sire .
He 's no eyass But a passage-hawk that footed ere we caught him , Dangerously free o ' the air .
Faith !
were he mine -LRB- As mine 's the glove he binds to for his tirings -RRB- I 'd fly him with a make-hawk .
He 's in yarak Plumed to the very point -- so manned , so weathered ... Give him the firmament God made him for , And what shall take the air of him ?
Gow 's Watch Lurgan Sahib did not use as direct speech , but his advice tallied with Mahbub 's ; and the upshot was good for Kim .
He knew better now than to leave Lucknow city in native garb , and if Mahbub were anywhere within reach of a letter , it was to Mahbub 's camp he headed , and made his change under the Pathan 's wary eye .
Could the little Survey paint-box that he used for map-tinting in term-time have found a tongue to tell of holiday doings , he might have been expelled .
Once Mahbub and he went together as far as the beautiful city of Bombay , with three truckloads of tram-horses , and Mahbub nearly melted when Kim proposed a sail in a dhow across the Indian Ocean to buy Gulf Arabs , which , he understood from a hanger-on of the dealer Abdul Rahman , fetched better prices than mere Kabulis .
He dipped his hand into the dish with that great trader when Mahbub and a few co-religionists were invited to a big Haj dinner .
They came back by way of Karachi by sea , when Kim took his first experience of sea-sickness sitting on the fore-hatch of a coasting-steamer , well persuaded he had been poisoned .
The Babu 's famous drug-box proved useless , though Kim had restocked it at Bombay .
Mahbub had business at Quetta , and there Kim , as Mahbub admitted , earned his keep , and perhaps a little over , by spending four curious days as scullion in the house of a fat Commissariat sergeant , from whose office-box , in an auspicious moment , he removed a little vellum ledger which he copied out -- it seemed to deal entirely with cattle and camel sales -- by moonlight , lying behind an outhouse , all through one hot night .
Then he returned the ledger to its place , and , at Mahbub 's word , left that service unpaid , rejoining him six miles down the road , the clean copy in his bosom .
` That soldier is a small fish , ' Mahbub Ali explained , ` but in time we shall catch the larger one .
He only sells oxen at two prices -- one for himself and one for the Government -- which I do not think is a sin . '
` Why could not I take away the little book and be done with it ? '
` Then he would have been frightened , and he would have told his master .
Then we should miss , perhaps , a great number of new rifles which seek their way up from Quetta to the North .
The Game is so large that one sees but a little at a time . '
` Oho ! '
said Kim , and held his tongue .
That was in the monsoon holidays , after he had taken the prize for mathematics .
The Christmas holidays he spent -- deducting ten days for private amusements -- with Lurgan Sahib , where he sat for the most part in front of a roaring wood-fire -- Jakko road was four feet deep in snow that year -- and -- the small Hindu had gone away to be married -- helped Lurgan to thread pearls .
He made Kim learn whole chapters of the Koran by heart , till he could deliver them with the very roll and cadence of a mullah .
Moreover , he told Kim the names and properties of many native drugs , as well as the runes proper to recite when you administer them .
And in the evenings he wrote charms on parchment -- elaborate pentagrams crowned with the names of devils -- Murra , and Awan the Companion of Kings -- all fantastically written in the corners .
More to the point , he advised Kim as to the care of his own body , the cure of fever-fits , and simple remedies of the Road .
A week before it was time to go down , Colonel Creighton Sahib -- this was unfair -- sent Kim a written examination paper that concerned itself solely with rods and chains and links and angles .
Next holidays he was out with Mahbub , and here , by the way , he nearly died of thirst , plodding through the sand on a camel to the mysterious city of Bikanir , where the wells are four hundred feet deep , and lined throughout with camel-bone .
It was not an amusing trip from Kim 's point of view , because -- in defiance of the contract -- the Colonel ordered him to make a map of that wild , walled city ; and since Mohammedan horse-boys and pipe-tenders are not expected to drag Survey-chains round the capital of an independent Native State , Kim was forced to pace all his distances by means of a bead rosary .
He used the compass for bearings as occasion served -- after dark chiefly , when the camels had been fed -- and by the help of his little Survey paint-box of six colour-cakes and three brushes , he achieved something not remotely unlike the city of Jeysulmir .
Mahbub laughed a great deal , and advised him to make up a written report as well ; and in the back of the big account-book that lay under the flap of Mahbub 's pet saddle Kim fell to work .
.
` It must hold everything that thou hast seen or touched or considered .
Write as though the Jung-i-Lat Sahib himself had come by stealth with a vast army outsetting to war . '
` How great an army ? '
` Oh , half a lakh of men . '
` Folly !
Remember how few and bad were the wells in the sand .
Not a thousand thirsty men could come near by here . '
` Then write that down -- also all the old breaches in the walls and whence the firewood is cut -- and what is the temper and disposition of the King .
I stay here till all my horses are sold .
I will hire a room by the gateway , and thou shalt be my accountant .
There is a good lock to the door . '
The report in its unmistakable St Xavier 's running script , and the brown , yellow , and lake-daubed map , was on hand a few years ago -LRB- a careless clerk filed it with the rough notes of E 's second Seistan survey -RRB- , but by now the pencil characters must be almost illegible .
Kim translated it , sweating under the light of an oil-lamp , to Mahbub , the second day of their return-journey .
The Pathan rose and stooped over his dappled saddle-bags . '
I knew it would be worthy a dress of honour , and so I made one ready , ' he said , smiling .
` Were I Amir of Afghanistan -LRB- and some day we may see him -RRB- , I would fill thy mouth with gold . '
He laid the garments formally at Kim 's feet .
There was a gold-embroidered Peshawur turban-cap , rising to a cone , and a big turban-cloth ending in a broad fringe of gold .
There was a Delhi embroidered waistcoat to slip over a milky white shirt , fastening to the right , ample and flowing ; green pyjamas with twisted silk waist-string ; and that nothing might be lacking , russia-leather slippers , smelling divinely , with arrogantly curled tips .
` Upon a Wednesday , and in the morning , to put on new clothes is auspicious , ' said Mahbub solemnly .
` But we must not forget the wicked folk in the world .
So ! '
He capped all the splendour , that was taking Kim 's delighted breath away , with a mother-of-pearl , nickel-plated , self-extracting .450 revolver . '
I had thought of a smaller bore , but reflected that this takes Government bullets .
A man can always come by those -- especially across the Border .
Stand up and let me look . '
He clapped Kim on the shoulder .
` May you never be tired , Pathan !
Oh , the hearts to be broken !
Oh , the eyes under the eyelashes , looking sideways ! '
Kim turned about , pointed his toes , stretched , and felt mechanically for the moustache that was just beginning .
Then he stooped towards Mahbub 's feet to make proper acknowledgment with fluttering , quick-patting hands ; his heart too full for words .
Mahbub forestalled and embraced him .
` My son , said he , ` what need of words between us ?
But is not the little gun a delight ?
All six cartridges come out at one twist .
It is borne in the bosom next the skin , which , as it were , keeps it oiled .
Never put it elsewhere , and please God , thou shalt some day kill a man with it . '
` Hai mai ! '
said Kim ruefully .
` If a Sahib kills a man he is hanged in the jail . '
` True : but one pace beyond the Border , men are wiser .
Put it away ; but fill it first .
Of what use is a gun unfed ? '
` When I go back to the madrissah I must return it .
They do not allow little guns .
Thou wilt keep it for me ? '
` Son , I am wearied of that madrissah , where they take the best years of a man to teach him what he can only learn upon the Road .
The folly of the Sahibs has neither top nor bottom .
No matter .
Maybe thy written report shall save thee further bondage ; and God He knows we need men more and more in the Game . '
They marched , jaw-bound against blowing sand , across the salt desert to Jodhpur , where Mahbub and his handsome nephew Habib Ullah did much trading ; and then sorrowfully , in European clothes , which he was fast outgrowing , Kim went second-class to St Xavier 's .
Three weeks later , Colonel Creighton , pricing Tibetan ghost-daggers at Lurgan 's shop , faced Mahbub Ali openly mutinous .
Lurgan Sahib operated as support in reserve .
` The pony is made -- finished -- mouthed and paced , Sahib !
From now on , day by day , he will lose his manners if he is kept at tricks .
Drop the rein on his back and let go , ' said the horse-dealer .
` We need him . '
` But he is so young , Mahbub -- not more than sixteen -- is he ? '
` When I was fifteen , I had shot my man and begot my man , Sahib . '
` You impenitent old heathen ! '
Creighton turned to Lurgan .
The black beard nodded assent to the wisdom of the Afghan 's dyed scarlet . '
I should have used him long ago , ' said Lurgan .
` The younger the better .
That is why I always have my really valuable jewels watched by a child .
You sent him to me to try .
I tried him in every way : he is the only boy I could not make to see things . '
` In the crystal -- in the ink-pool ? '
demanded Mahbub .
` No .
Under my hand , as I told you .
That has never happened before .
It means that he is strong enough -- but you think it skittles , Colonel Creighton -- to make anyone do anything he wants .
And that is three years ago .
I have taught him a good deal since , Colonel Creighton .
I think you waste him now . '
` Hmm !
Maybe you 're right .
But , as you know , there is no Survey work for him at present . '
` Let him out let him go , ' Mahbub interrupted .
` Who expects any colt to carry heavy weight at first ?
Let him run with the caravans -- like our white camel-colts -- for luck .
I would take him myself , but -- ' ` There is a little business where he would be most useful -- in the South , ' said Lurgan , with peculiar suavity , dropping his heavy blued eyelids .
` E. 23 has that in hand , ' said Creighton quickly .
` He must not go down there .
Besides , he knows no Turki . '
` Only tell him the shape and the smell of the letters we want and he will bring them back , ' Lurgan insisted .
` No .
That is a man 's job , ' said Creighton .
It was a wry-necked matter of unauthorized and incendiary correspondence between a person who claimed to be the ultimate authority in all matters of the Mohammedan religion throughout the world , and a younger member of a royal house who had been brought to book for kidnapping women within British territory .
The Moslem Archbishop had been emphatic and over-arrogant ; the young prince was merely sulky at the curtailment of his privileges , but there was no need he should continue a correspondence which might some day compromise him .
One letter indeed had been procured , but the finder was later found dead by the roadside in the habit of an Arab trader , as E. 23 , taking up the work , duly reported .
These facts , and a few others not to be published , made both Mahbub and Creighton shake their heads .
` Let him go out with his Red Lama , ' said the horse-dealer with visible effort .
` He is fond of the old man .
He can learn his paces by the rosary at least . ' '
I have had some dealings with the old man -- by letter , ' said Colonel Creighton , smiling to himself .
` Whither goes he ? '
` Up and down the land , as he has these three years .
He seeks a River of Healing .
God 's curse upon all -- ' Mahbub checked himself .
` He beds down at the Temple of the Tirthankars or at Buddh Gaya when he is in from the Road .
Then he goes to see the boy at the madrissah , as we know for the boy was punished for it twice or thrice .
He is quite mad , but a peaceful man .
I have met him .
The Babu also has had dealings with him .
We have watched him for three years .
Red Lamas are not so common in Hind that one loses track . '
` Babus are very curious , ' said Lurgan meditatively .
` Do you know what Hurree Babu really wants ?
He wants to be made a member of the Royal Society by taking ethnological notes .
I tell you , I tell him about the lama everything which Mahbub and the boy have told me .
Hurree Babu goes down to Benares -- at his own expense , I think . ' '
I do n't , ' said Creighton briefly .
He had paid Hurree 's travelling expenses , out of a most lively curiosity to learn what the lama might be .
` And he applies to the lama for information on lamaism , and devil-dances , and spells and charms , several times in these few years .
Holy Virgin !
I could have told him all that yeears ago .
I think Hurree Babu is getting too old for the Road .
He likes better to collect manners and customs information .
Yes , he wants to be an FRS .
` Hurree thinks well of the boy , does n't he ? '
` Oh , very indeed -- we have had some pleasant evenings at my little place -- but I think it would be waste to throw him away with Hurree on the Ethnological side . '
` Not for a first experience .
How does that strike you , Mahbub ?
Let the boy run with the lama for six months .
After that we can see .
He will get experience . '
` He has it already , Sahib -- as a fish controls the water he swims in .
But for every reason it will be well to loose him from the school . '
` Very good , then , ' said Creighton , half to himself .
` He can go with the lama , and if Hurree Babu cares to keep an eye on them so much the better .
He wo n't lead the boy into any danger as Mahbub would .
Curious -- his wish to be an F R S. Very human , too .
He is best on the Ethnological side -- Hurree . '
No money and no preferment would have drawn Creighton from his work on the Indian Survey , but deep in his heart also lay the ambition to write ' F R S ' after his name .
Honours of a sort he knew could be obtained by ingenuity and the help of friends , but , to the best of his belief , nothing save work -- papers representing a life of it -- took a man into the Society which he had bombarded for years with monographs on strange Asiatic cults and unknown customs .
Nine men out of ten would flee from a Royal Society soiree in extremity of boredom ; but Creighton was the tenth , and at times his soul yearned for the crowded rooms in easy London where silver-haired , bald-headed gentlemen who know nothing of the Army move among spectroscopic experiments , the lesser plants of the frozen tundras , electric flight-measuring machines , and apparatus for slicing into fractional millimetres the left eye of the female mosquito .
By all right and reason , it was the Royal Geographical that should have appealed to him , but men are as chancy as children in their choice of playthings .
So Creighton smiled , and thought the better of Hurree Babu , moved by like desire .
He dropped the ghost-dagger and looked up at Mahbub .
` How soon can we get the colt from the stable ? '
said the horse-dealer , reading his eyes .
` Hmm !
If I withdraw him by order now -- what will he do , think you ?
I have never before assisted at the teaching of such an one . '
` He will come to me , ' said Mahbub promptly .
` Lurgan Sahib and I will prepare him for the Road . '
` So be it , then .
For six months he shall run at his choice .
But who will be his sponsor ? '
Lurgan slightly inclined his head .
` He will not tell anything , if that is what you are afraid of , Colonel Creighton . '
` It 's only a boy , after all . '
` Ye-es ; but first , he has nothing to tell ; and secondly , he knows what would happen .
Also , he is very fond of Mahbub , and of me a little . '
` Will he draw pay ? '
demanded the practical horse-dealer .
` Food and water allowance only .
Twenty rupees a month . '
One advantage of the Secret Service is that it has no worrying audit .
That Service is ludicrously starved , of course , but the funds are administered by a few men who do not call for vouchers or present itemized accounts .
Mahbub 's eyes lighted with almost a Sikh 's love of money .
Even Lurgan 's impassive face changed .
He considered the years to come when Kim would have been entered and made to the Great Game that never ceases day and night , throughout India .
He foresaw honour and credit in the mouths of a chosen few , coming to him from his pupil .
Lurgan Sahib had made E. 23 what E. 23 was , out of a bewildered , impertinent , lying , little North-West Province man .
But the joy of these masters was pale and smoky beside the joy of Kim when St Xavier 's Head called him aside , with word that Colonel Creighton had sent for him . '
I understand , O'Hara , that he has found you a place as an assistant chain-man in the Canal Department : that comes of taking up mathematics .
It is great luck for you , for you are only sixteen ; but of course you understand that you do not become pukka -LSB- permanent -RSB- till you have passed the autumn examination .
So you must not think you are going out into the world to enjoy yourself , or that your fortune is made .
There is a great deal of hard work before you .
Only , if you succeed in becoming pukka , you can rise , you know , to four hundred and fifty a month . '
Whereat the Principal gave him much good advice as to his conduct , and his manners , and his morals ; and others , his elders , who had not been wafted into billets , talked as only Anglo-Indian lads can , of favouritism and corruption .
Indeed , young Cazalet , whose father was a pensioner at Chunar , hinted very broadly that Colonel Creighton 's interest in Kim was directly paternal ; and Kim , instead of retaliating , did not even use language .
He was thinking of the immense fun to come , of Mahbub 's letter of the day before , all neatly written in English , making appointment for that afternoon in a house the very name of which would have crisped the Principal 's hair with horror ... Said Kim to Mahbub in Lucknow railway station that evening , above the luggage-scales : ' I feared lest at the last , the roof would fall upon me and cheat me .
It is indeed all finished , O my father ? '
Mahbub snapped his fingers to show the utterness of that end , and his eyes blazed like red coals .
` Then where is the pistol that I may wear it ? '
` Softly !
A half-year , to run without heel-ropes .
I begged that much from Colonel Creighton Sahib .
At twenty rupees a month .
Old Red Hat knows that thou art coming . ' '
I will pay thee dustoorie -LSB- commission -RSB- on my pay for three months , ' said Kim gravely .
` Yea , two rupees a month .
But first we must get rid of these . '
He plucked his thin linen trousers and dragged at his collar . '
I have brought with me all that I need on the Road .
My trunk has gone up to Lurgan Sahib 's . '
` Who sends his salaams to thee -- Sahib . '
` Lurgan Sahib is a very clever man .
But what dost thou do ? ' '
I go North again , upon the Great Game .
What else ?
Is thy mind still set on following old Red Hat ? '
` Do not forget he made me that I am -- though he did not know it .
Year by year , he sent the money that taught me . ' '
I would have done as much -- had it struck my thick head , ' Mahbub growled .
` Come away .
The lamps are lit now , and none will mark thee in the bazar .
We go to Huneefa 's house . '
On the way thither , Mahbub gave him much the same sort of advice as his mother gave to Lemuel , and curiously enough , Mahbub was exact to point out how Huneefa and her likes destroyed kings .
` And I remember , ' he quoted maliciously , ` one who said , `` Trust a snake before an harlot , and an harlot before a Pathan , Mahbub Ali . ''
Now , excepting as to Pathans , of whom I am one , all that is true .
Most true is it in the Great Game , for it is by means of women that all plans come to ruin and we lie out in the dawning with our throats cut .
So it happened to such a one . '
He gave the reddest particulars .
` Then why -- ? '
Kim paused before a filthy staircase that climbed to the warm darkness of an upper chamber , in the ward that is behind Azim Ullah 's tobacco-shop .
Those who know it call it The Birdcage -- it is so full of whisperings and whistlings and chirrupings .
The room , with its dirty cushions and half-smoked hookahs , smelt abominably of stale tobacco .
In one corner lay a huge and shapeless woman clad in greenish gauzes , and decked , brow , nose , ear , neck , wrist , arm , waist , and ankle with heavy native jewellery .
When she turned it was like the clashing of copper pots .
A lean cat in the balcony outside the window mewed hungrily .
Kim checked , bewildered , at the door-curtain .
` Is that the new stuff , Mahbub ? '
said Huneefa lazily , scarce troubling to remove the mouthpiece from her lips . '
O Buktanoos ! '
-- like most of her kind , she swore by the Djinns -- ' O Buktanoos !
He is very good to look upon . '
` That is part of the selling of the horse , ' Mahbub explained to Kim , who laughed . '
I have heard that talk since my Sixth Day , ' he replied , squatting by the light .
` Whither does it lead ? '
` To protection .
Tonight we change thy colour .
This sleeping under roofs has blanched thee like an almond .
But Huneefa has the secret of a colour that catches .
No painting of a day or two .
Also , we fortify thee against the chances of the Road .
That is my gift to thee , my son .
Take out all metals on thee and lay them here .
Make ready , Huneefa . '
Kim dragged forth his compass , Survey paint-box , and the new-filled medicine-box .
They had all accompanied his travels , and boylike he valued them immensely .
The woman rose slowly and moved with her hands a little spread before her .
Then Kim saw that she was blind .
` No , no , ' she muttered , ` the Pathan speaks truth -- my colour does not go in a week or a month , and those whom I protect are under strong guard . '
` When one is far off and alone , it would not be well to grow blotched and leprous of a sudden , ' said Mahbub .
` When thou wast with me I could oversee the matter .
Besides , a Pathan is a fair-skin .
Strip to the waist now and look how thou art whitened . '
Huneefa felt her way back from an inner room .
` It is no matter , she can not see . '
He took a pewter bowl from her ringed hand .
The dye-stuff showed blue and gummy .
Kim experimented on the back of his wrist , with a dab of cotton-wool ; but Huneefa heard him .
` No , no , ' she cried , ` the thing is not done thus , but with the proper ceremonies .
The colouring is the least part .
I give thee the full protection of the Road . '
` Tadoo ?
-LSB- magic -RSB- , ` said Kim , with a half start .
He did not like the white , sightless eyes .
Mahbub 's hand on his neck bowed him to the floor , nose within an inch of the boards .
` Be still .
No harm comes to thee , my son .
I am thy sacrifice ! '
He could not see what the woman was about , but heard the dish-clash of her jewellery for many minutes .
A match lit up the darkness ; he caught the well-known purr and fizzle of grains of incense .
Then the room filled with smoke -- heavy aromatic , and stupefying .
Through growing drowse he heard the names of devils -- of Zulbazan , Son of Eblis , who lives in bazars and paraos , making all the sudden lewd wickedness of wayside halts ; of Dulhan , invisible about mosques , the dweller among the slippers of the faithful , who hinders folk from their prayers ; and Musboot , Lord of lies and panic .
Huneefa , now whispering in his ear , now talking as from an immense distance , touched him with horrible soft fingers , but Mahbub 's grip never shifted from his neck till , relaxing with a sigh , the boy lost his senses .
` Allah !
How he fought !
We should never have done it but for the drugs .
That was his white blood , I take it , ' said Mahbub testily .
` Go on with the dawut -LSB- invocation -RSB- .
Give him full Protection . ' '
O Hearer !
Thou that hearest with ears , be present .
Listen , O Hearer ! '
Huneefa moaned , her dead eyes turned to the west .
The dark room filled with moanings and snortings .
From the outer balcony , a ponderous figure raised a round bullet head and coughed nervously .
` Do not interrupt this ventriloquial necromanciss , my friend , ' it said in English . '
I opine that it is very disturbing to you , but no enlightened observer is jolly-well upset . ' '
... ... I will lay a plot for their ruin !
O Prophet , bear with the unbelievers .
Let them alone awhile ! '
Huneefa 's face , turned to the northward , worked horribly , and it was as though voices from the ceiling answered her .
Hurree Babu returned to his note-book , balanced on the window-sill , but his hand shook .
Huneefa , in some sort of drugged ecstasy , wrenched herself to and fro as she sat cross-legged by Kim 's still head , and called upon devil after devil , in the ancient order of the ritual , binding them to avoid the boy 's every action .
` With Him are the keys of the Secret Things !
None knoweth them besides Himself He knoweth that which is in the dry land and in the sea ! '
Again broke out the unearthly whistling responses .
` I -- I apprehend it is not at all malignant in its operation ? '
said the Babu , watching the throat-muscles quiver and jerk as Huneefa spoke with tongues .
` It -- it is not likely that she has killed the boy ?
If so , I decline to be witness at the trial ... What was the last hypothetical devil mentioned ? '
` Babuji , ' said Mahbub in the vernacular . '
I have no regard for the devils of Hind , but the Sons of Eblis are far otherwise , and whether they be jumalee -LSB- well-affected -RSB- or jullalee -LSB- terrible -RSB- they love not Kafirs . '
` Then you think I had better go ? '
said Hurree Babu , half rising .
` They are , of course , dematerialized phenomena .
Spencer says . '
Huneefa 's crisis passed , as these things must , in a paroxysm of howling , with a touch of froth at the lips .
She lay spent and motionless beside Kim , and the crazy voices ceased .
` Wah !
That work is done .
May the boy be better for it ; and Huneefa is surely a mistress of dawut .
Help haul her aside , Babu .
Do not be afraid . '
` How am I to fear the absolutely non-existent ? '
said Hurree Babu , talking English to reassure himself .
It is an awful thing still to dread the magic that you contemptuously investigate -- to collect folk-lore for the Royal Society with a lively belief in all Powers of Darkness .
Mahbub chuckled .
He had been out with Hurree on the Road ere now .
` Let us finish the colouring , ' said he .
` The boy is well protected if -- if the Lords of the Air have ears to hear .
I am a Sufi -LSB- free-thinker -RSB- , but when one can get blind-sides of a woman , a stallion , or a devil , why go round to invite a kick ?
Set him upon the way , Babu , and see that old Red Hat does not lead him beyond our reach .
I must get back to my horses . '
` All raight , ' said Hurree Babu .
` He is at present curious spectacle . '
About third cockcrow , Kim woke after a sleep of thousands of years .
Huneefa , in her corner , snored heavily , but Mahbub was gone . '
I hope you were not frightened , ' said an oily voice at his elbow . '
I superintended entire operation , which was most interesting from ethnological point of view .
It was high-class dawut . '
` Huh ! '
said Kim , recognizing Hurree Babu , who smiled ingratiatingly .
` And also I had honour to bring down from Lurgan your present costume .
I am not in the habit offeecially of carrying such gauds to subordinates , but ' -- he giggled -- ` your case is noted as exceptional on the books .
I hope Mr Lurgan will note my action . '
Kim yawned and stretched himself .
It was good to turn and twist within loose clothes once again .
` What is this ? '
He looked curiously at the heavy duffle-stuff loaded with the scents of the far North .
` Oho !
That is inconspicuous dress of chela attached to service of lamaistic lama .
Complete in every particular , ' said Hurree Babu , rolling into the balcony to clean his teeth at a goglet . '
I am of opeenion it is not your old gentleman 's precise releegion , but rather sub-variant of same .
I have contributed rejected notes To Whom It May Concern : Asiatic Quarterly Review on these subjects .
Now it is curious that the old gentleman himself is totally devoid of releegiosity .
He is not a dam ' particular . '
` Do you know him ? '
Hurree Babu held up his hand to show he was engaged in the prescribed rites that accompany tooth-cleaning and such things among decently bred Bengalis .
Then he recited in English an Arya-Somaj prayer of a theistical nature , and stuffed his mouth with pan and betel .
` Oah yes .
I have met him several times at Benares , and also at Buddh Gaya , to interrogate him on releegious points and devil-worship .
He is pure agnostic -- same as me . '
Huneefa stirred in her sleep , and Hurree Babu jumped nervously to the copper incense-burner , all black and discoloured in morning-light , rubbed a finger in the accumulated lamp-black , and drew it diagonally across his face .
` Who has died in thy house ? '
asked Kim in the vernacular .
` None .
But she may have the Evil Eye -- that sorceress , ' the Babu replied .
` What dost thou do now , then ? ' '
I will set thee on thy way to Benares , if thou goest thither , and tell thee what must be known by Us . ' '
I go .
At what hour runs the te-rain ? '
He rose to his feet , looked round the desolate chamber and at the yellow-wax face of Huneefa as the low sun stole across the floor .
` Is there money to be paid that witch ? '
` No .
She has charmed thee against all devils and all dangers in the name of her devils .
It was Mahbub 's desire . '
In English : ` He is highly obsolete , I think , to indulge in such supersteetion .
Why , it is all ventriloquy .
Belly-speak -- eh ? '
Kim snapped his fingers mechanically to avert whatever evil -- Mahbub , he knew , meditated none -- might have crept in through Huneefa 's ministrations ; and Hurree giggled once more .
But as he crossed the room he was careful not to step in Huneefa 's blotched , squat shadow on the boards .
Witches -- when their time is on them -- can lay hold of the heels of a man 's soul if he does that .
` Now you must well listen , ' said the Babu when they were in the fresh air .
` Part of these ceremonies which we witnessed they include supply of effeecient amulet to those of our Department .
If you feel in your neck you will find one small silver amulet , verree cheap .
That is ours .
Do you understand ? '
` Oah yes , hawa-dilli -LSB- a heart-lifter -RSB- , ' said Kim , feeling at his neck .
` Huneefa she makes them for two rupees twelve annas with -- oh , all sorts of exorcisms .
They are quite common , except they are partially black enamel , and there is a paper inside each one full of names of local saints and such things .
Thatt is Huneefa 's look-out , you see ?
Huneefa makes them onlee for us , but in case she does not , when we get them we put in , before issue , one small piece of turquoise .
Mr Lurgan he gives them .
There is no other source of supply ; but it was me invented all this .
It is strictly unoffeecial of course , but convenient for subordinates .
Colonel Creighton he does not know .
He is European .
The turquoise is wrapped in the paper ... Yes , that is road to railway station ... Now suppose you go with the lama , or with me , I hope , some day , or with Mahbub .
Suppose we get into a dam ' - tight place .
I am a fearful man -- most fearful -- but I tell you I have been in dam ' - tight places more than hairs on my head .
You say : `` I am Son of the Charm . ''
Verree good . ' '
I do not understand quite .
We must not be heard talking English here . '
` That is all raight .
I am only Babu showing off my English to you .
All we Babus talk English to show off ; ' said Hurree , flinging his shoulder-cloth jauntily .
` As I was about to say , `` Son of the Charm '' means that you may be member of the Sat Bhai -- the Seven Brothers , which is Hindi and Tantric .
It is popularly supposed to be extinct Society , but I have written notes to show it is still extant .
You see , it is all my invention .
Verree good .
Sat Bhai has many members , and perhaps before they jolly-well-cut-your-throat they may give you just a chance of life .
That is useful , anyhow .
And moreover , these foolish natives -- if they are not too excited -- they always stop to think before they kill a man who says he belongs to any speecific organization .
You see ?
You say then when you are in tight place , `` I am Son of the Charm '' , and you get -- perhaps -- ah -- your second wind .
That is only in extreme instances , or to open negotiations with a stranger .
Can you quite see ?
Verree good .
But suppose now , I , or any one of the Department , come to you dressed quite different .
You would not know me at all unless I choose , I bet you .
Some day I will prove it .
I come as Ladakhi trader -- oh , anything -- and I say to you : `` You want to buy precious stones ? ''
You say : `` Do I look like a man who buys precious stones ? ''
Then I say : `` Even verree poor man can buy a turquoise or tarkeean . '' '
` That is kichree -- vegetable curry , ' said Kim .
` Of course it is .
You say : `` Let me see the tarkeean . ''
Then I say : `` It was cooked by a woman , and perhaps it is bad for your caste . ''
Then you say : `` There is no caste when men go to -- look for tarkeean . ''
You stop a little between those words , `` to -- look '' .
That is thee whole secret .
The little stop before the words . '
Kim repeated the test-sentence .
` That is all right .
Then I will show you my turquoise if there is time , and then you know who I am , and then we exchange views and documents and those-all things .
And so it is with any other man of us .
We talk sometimes about turquoises and sometimes about tarkeean , but always with that little stop in the words .
It is verree easy .
First , `` Son of the Charm '' , if you are in a tight place .
Perhaps that may help you -- perhaps not .
Then what I have told you about the tarkeean , if you want to transact offeecial business with a strange man .
Of course , at present , you have no offeecial business .
You are -- ah ha !
-- supernumerary on probation .
Quite unique specimen .
If you were Asiatic of birth you might be employed right off ; but this half-year of leave is to make you de-Englishized , you see ?
The lama he expects you , because I have demi-offeecially informed him you have passed all your examinations , and will soon obtain Government appointment .
Oh ho !
You are on acting-allowance , you see : so if you are called upon to help Sons of the Charm mind you jolly-well try .
Now I shall say good-bye , my dear fellow , and I hope you -- ah -- will come out top-side all raight . '
Hurree Babu stepped back a pace or two into the crowd at the entrance of Lucknow station and -- was gone .
Kim drew a deep breath and hugged himself all over .
The nickel-plated revolver he could feel in the bosom of his sad-coloured robe , the amulet was on his neck ; begging-gourd , rosary , and ghost-dagger -LRB- Mr Lurgan had forgotten nothing -RRB- were all to hand , with medicine , paint-box , and compass , and in a worn old purse-belt embroidered with porcupine-quill patterns lay a month 's pay .
Kings could be no richer .
He bought sweetmeats in a leaf-cup from a Hindu trader , and ate them with glad rapture till a policeman ordered him off the steps .
Chapter 11 Give the man who is not made To his trade Swords to fling and catch again , Coins to ring and snatch again , Men to harm and cure again , Snakes to charm and lure again -- He 'll be hurt by his own blade , By his serpents disobeyed , By his clumsiness bewrayed , ' By the people mocked to scorn -- So 't is not with juggler born !
Pinch of dust or withered flower , Chance-flung fruit or borrowed staff , Serve his need and shore his power , Bind the spell , or loose the laugh !
But a man who , etc. .
The Juggler 's Song , op. 15 Followed a sudden natural reaction .
` Now am I alone -- all alone , ' he thought .
` In all India is no one so alone as I !
If I die today , who shall bring the news -- and to whom ?
If I live and God is good , there will be a price upon my head , for I am a Son of the Charm -- I , Kim . '
A very few white people , but many Asiatics , can throw themselves into a mazement as it were by repeating their own names over and over again to themselves , letting the mind go free upon speculation as to what is called personal identity .
When one grows older , the power , usually , departs , but while it lasts it may descend upon a man at any moment .
` Who is Kim -- Kim -- Kim ? '
He squatted in a corner of the clanging waiting-room , rapt from all other thoughts ; hands folded in lap , and pupils contracted to pin-points .
In a minute -- in another half-second -- he felt he would arrive at the solution of the tremendous puzzle ; but here , as always happens , his mind dropped away from those heights with a rush of a wounded bird , and passing his hand before his eyes , he shook his head .
A long-haired Hindu bairagi -LSB- holy man -RSB- , who had just bought a ticket , halted before him at that moment and stared intently . '
I also have lost it , ' he said sadly .
` It is one of the Gates to the Way , but for me it has been shut many years . '
` What is the talk ? '
said Kim , abashed .
` Thou wast wondering there in thy spirit what manner of thing thy soul might be .
The seizure came of a sudden .
I know .
Who should know but I ?
Whither goest thou ? '
` Toward Kashi -LSB- Benares -RSB- . '
` There are no Gods there .
I have proved them .
I go to Prayag -LSB- Allahabad -RSB- for the fifth time -- seeking the Road to Enlightenment .
Of what faith art thou ? ' '
I too am a Seeker , ' said Kim , using one of the lama 's pet words .
` Though ' -- he forgot his Northern dress for the moment -- ` though Allah alone knoweth what I seek . '
The old fellow slipped the bairagi 's crutch under his armpit and sat down on a patch of ruddy leopard 's skin as Kim rose at the call for the Benares train .
` Go in hope , little brother , ' he said .
` It is a long road to the feet of the One ; but thither do we all travel . '
Kim did not feel so lonely after this , and ere he had sat out twenty miles in the crowded compartment , was cheering his neighbours with a string of most wonderful yarns about his own and his master 's magical gifts .
Benares struck him as a peculiarly filthy city , though it was pleasant to find how his cloth was respected .
At least one-third of the population prays eternally to some group or other of the many million deities , and so reveres every sort of holy man .
Kim was guided to the Temple of the Tirthankars , about a mile outside the city , near Sarnath , by a chance-met Punjabi farmer -- a Kamboh from Jullundur-way who had appealed in vain to every God of his homestead to cure his small son , and was trying Benares as a last resort .
` Thou art from the North ? '
he asked , shouldering through the press of the narrow , stinking streets much like his own pet bull at home .
` Ay , I know the Punjab .
My mother was a pahareen , but my father came from Amritzar -- by Jandiala , ' said Kim , oiling his ready tongue for the needs of the Road .
` Jandiala -- Jullundur ?
Oho !
Then we be neighbours in some sort , as it were . '
He nodded tenderly to the wailing child in his arms .
` Whom dost thou serve ? ' '
A most holy man at the Temple of the Tirthankers . '
` They are all most holy and -- most greedy , ' said the Jat with bitterness . '
I have walked the pillars and trodden the temples till my feet are flayed , and the child is no whit better .
And the mother being sick too ... Hush , then , little one ... We changed his name when the fever came .
We put him into girl 's clothes .
There was nothing we did not do , except -- I said to his mother when she bundled me off to Benares -- she should have come with me -- I said Sakhi Sarwar Sultan would serve us best .
We know His generosity , but these down-country Gods are strangers . '
The child turned on the cushion of the huge corded arms and looked at Kim through heavy eyelids .
` And was it all worthless ? '
Kim asked , with easy interest .
` All worthless -- all worthless , ' said the child , lips cracking with fever .
` The Gods have given him a good mind , at least ' said the father proudly .
` To think he should have listened so cleverly .
Yonder is thy Temple .
Now I am a poor man -- many priests have dealt with me -- but my son is my son , and if a gift to thy master can cure him -- I am at my very wits ' end . '
Kim considered for a while , tingling with pride .
Three years ago he would have made prompt profit on the situation and gone his way without a thought ; but now , the very respect the Jat paid him proved that he was a man .
Moreover , he had tasted fever once or twice already , and knew enough to recognize starvation when he saw it .
` Call him forth and I will give him a bond on my best yoke , so that the child is cured . '
Kim halted at the carved outer door of the temple .
A white-clad Oswal banker from Ajmir , his sins of usury new wiped out , asked him what he did . '
I am chela to Teshoo Lama , an Holy One from Bhotiyal -- within there .
He bade me come .
I wait .
Tell him . '
` Do not forget the child , ' cried the importunate Jat over his shoulder , and then bellowed in Punjabi ; ' O Holy One -- O disciple of the Holy One -- O Gods above all the Worlds -- behold affliction sitting at the gate ! '
That cry is so common in Benares that the passers never turned their heads .
The Oswal , at peace with mankind , carried the message into the darkness behind him , and the easy , uncounted Eastern minutes slid by ; for the lama was asleep in his cell , and no priest would wake him .
When the click of his rosary again broke the hush of the inner court where the calm images of the Arhats stand , a novice whispered , ` Thy chela is here , ' and the old man strode forth , forgetting the end of that prayer .
Hardly had the tall figure shown in the doorway than the Jat ran before him , and , lifting up the child , cried : ` Look upon this , Holy One ; and if the Gods will , he lives -- he lives ! '
He fumbled in his waist-belt and drew out a small silver coin .
` What is now ? '
The lama 's eyes turned to Kim .
It was noticeable he spoke far clearer Urdu than long ago , under ZamZammah ; but father would allow no private talk .
` It is no more than a fever , ' said Kim .
` The child is not well fed . '
` He sickens at everything , and his mother is not here . '
` If it be permitted , I may cure , Holy One . '
` What !
Have they made thee a healer ?
Wait here , ' said the lama , and he sat down by the Jat upon the lowest step of the temple , while Kim , looking out of the corner of his eyes , slowly opened the little betel-box .
He had dreamed dreams at school of returning to the lama as a Sahib -- of chaffing the old man before he revealed himself -- boy 's dreams all .
There was more drama in this abstracted , brow-puckered search through the tabloid-bottles , with a pause here and there for thought and a muttered invocation between whiles .
Quinine he had in tablets , and dark brown meat-lozenges -- beef most probably , but that was not his business .
The little thing would not eat , but it sucked at a lozenge greedily , and said it liked the salt taste .
` Take then these six . '
Kim handed them to the man .
` Praise the Gods , and boil three in milk ; other three in water .
After he has drunk the milk give him this ' -LRB- it was the half of a quinine pill -RRB- , ` and wrap him warm .
Give him the water of the other three , and the other half of this white pill when he wakes .
Meantime , here is another brown medicine that he may suck at on the way home . '
` Gods , what wisdom ! '
said the Kamboh , snatching .
It was as much as Kim could remember of his own treatment in a bout of autumn malaria -- if you except the patter that he added to impress the lama .
` Now go !
Come again in the morning . '
` But the price -- the price , ' said the Jat , and threw back his sturdy shoulders .
` My son is my son .
Now that he will be whole again , how shall I go back to his mother and say I took help by the wayside and did not even give a bowl of curds in return ? '
` They are alike , these Jats , ' said Kim softly .
` The Jat stood on his dunghill and the King 's elephants went by .
`` O driver , '' said he , `` what will you sell those little donkeys for ? '' '
The Jat burst into a roar of laughter , stifled with apologies to the lama .
` It is the saying of my own country the very talk of it .
So are we Jats all .
I will come tomorrow with the child ; and the blessing of the Gods of the Homesteads -- who are good little Gods -- be on you both ... Now , son , we grow strong again .
Do not spit it out , little Princeling !
King of my Heart , do not spit it out , and we shall be strong men , wrestlers and club-wielders , by morning . '
He moved away , crooning and mumbling .
The lama turned to Kim , and all the loving old soul of him looked out through his narrow eyes .
` To heal the sick is to acquire merit ; but first one gets knowledge .
That was wisely done , O Friend of all the World . ' '
I was made wise by thee , Holy One , ' said Kim , forgetting the little play just ended ; forgetting St Xavier 's ; forgetting his white blood ; forgetting even the Great Game as he stooped , Mohammedan-fashion , to touch his master 's feet in the dust of the Jain temple .
` My teaching I owe to thee .
I have eaten thy bread three years .
My time is finished .
I am loosed from the schools .
I come to thee . '
` Herein is my reward .
Enter !
Enter !
And is all well ? '
They passed to the inner court , where the afternoon sun sloped golden across .
` Stand that I may see .
So ! '
He peered critically .
` It is no longer a child , but a man , ripened in wisdom , walking as a physician .
I did well -- I did well when I gave thee up to the armed men on that black night .
Dost thou remember our first day under Zam-Zammah ? '
` Ay , ' said Kim .
` Dost thou remember when I leapt off the carriage the first day I went to -- ' ` The Gates of Learning ?
Truly .
And the day that we ate the cakes together at the back of the river by Nucklao .
Aha !
Many times hast thou begged for me , but that day I begged for thee . '
` Good reason , ' quoth Kim . '
I was then a scholar in the Gates of Learning , and attired as a Sahib .
Do not forget , Holy One , ' he went on playfully . '
I am still a Sahib -- by thy favour . '
` True .
And a Sahib in most high esteem .
Come to my cell , chela . '
` How is that known to thee ? '
The lama smiled .
` First by means of letters from the kindly priest whom we met in the camp of armed men ; but he is now gone to his own country , and I sent the money to his brother . '
Colonel Creighton , who had succeeded to the trusteeship when Father Victor went to England with the Mavericks , was hardly the Chaplain 's brother .
` But I do not well understand Sahibs ' letters .
They must be interpreted to me .
I chose a surer way .
Many times when I returned from my Search to this Temple , which has always been a nest to me , there came one seeking Enlightenment -- a man from Leh -- that had been , he said , a Hindu , but wearied of all those Gods . '
The lama pointed to the Arhats . '
A fat man ? '
said Kim , a twinkle in his eye .
` Very fat ; but I perceived in a little his mind was wholly given up to useless things -- such as devils and charms and the form and fashion of our tea-drinkings in the monasteries , and by what road we initiated the novices .
A man abounding in questions ; but he was a friend of thine , chela .
He told me that thou wast on the road to much honour as a scribe .
And I see thou art a physician . '
` Yes , that am I -- a scribe , when I am a Sahib , but it is set aside when I come as thy disciple .
I have accomplished the years appointed for a Sahib . '
` As it were a novice ? '
said the lama , nodding his head .
` Art thou freed from the schools ?
I would not have thee unripe . ' '
I am all free .
In due time I take service under the Government as a scribe -- ' ` Not as a warrior .
That is well . '
` But first I come to wander with thee .
Therefore I am here .
Who begs for thee , these days ? '
he went on quickly .
The ice was thin .
` Very often I beg myself ; but , as thou knowest , I am seldom here , except when I come to look again at my disciple .
From one end to another of Hind have I travelled afoot and in the te-rain .
A great and a wonderful land !
But here , when I put in , is as though I were in my own Bhotiyal . '
He looked round the little clean cell complacently .
A low cushion gave him a seat , on which he had disposed himself in the cross-legged attitude of the Bodhisat emerging from meditation ; a black teak-wood table , not twenty inches high , set with copper tea-cups , was before him .
In one corner stood a tiny altar , also of heavily carved teak , bearing a copper-gilt image of the seated Buddha and fronted by a lamp , an incense-holder , and a pair of copper flower-pots .
` The Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House acquired merit by giving me these a year since , ' he said , following Kim 's eye .
` When one is far from one 's own land such things carry remembrance ; and we must reverence the Lord for that He showed the Way .
See ! '
He pointed to a curiously-built mound of coloured rice crowned with a fantastic metal ornament .
` When I was Abbot in my own place -- before I came to better knowledge I made that offering daily .
It is the Sacrifice of the Universe to the Lord .
Thus do we of Bhotiyal offer all the world daily to the Excellent Law .
And I do it even now , though I know that the Excellent One is beyond all pinchings and pattings . '
He snuffed from his gourd .
` It is well done , Holy One , ' Kim murmured , sinking at ease on the cushions , very happy and rather tired .
` And also , ' the old man chuckled , ' I write pictures of the Wheel of Life .
Three days to a picture .
I was busied on it -- or it may be I shut my eyes a little -- when they brought word of thee .
It is good to have thee here : I will show thee my art -- not for pride 's sake , but because thou must learn .
The Sahibs have not all this world 's wisdom . '
He drew from under the table a sheet of strangely scented yellow Chinese paper , the brushes , and slab of Indian ink .
In cleanest , severest outline he had traced the Great Wheel with its six spokes , whose centre is the conjoined Hog , Snake , and Dove -LRB- Ignorance , Anger , and Lust -RRB- , and whose compartments are all the Heavens and Hells , and all the chances of human life .
Men say that the Bodhisat Himself first drew it with grains of rice upon dust , to teach His disciples the cause of things .
Many ages have crystallized it into a most wonderful convention crowded with hundreds of little figures whose every line carries a meaning .
Few can translate the picture-parable ; there are not twenty in all the world who can draw it surely without a copy : of those who can both draw and expound are but three . '
I have a little learned to draw , ' said Kim .
` But this is a marvel beyond marvels . ' '
I have written it for many years , ' said the lama .
` Time was when I could write it all between one lamp-lighting and the next .
I will teach thee the art -- after due preparation ; and I will show thee the meaning of the Wheel . '
` We take the Road , then ? '
` The Road and our Search .
I was but waiting for thee .
It was made plain to me in a hundred dreams -- notably one that came upon the night of the day that the Gates of Learning first shut that without thee I should never find my River .
Again and again , as thou knowest , I put this from me , fearing an illusion .
Therefore I would not take thee with me that day at Lucknow , when we ate the cakes .
I would not take thee till the time was ripe and auspicious .
From the Hills to the Sea , from the Sea to the Hills have I gone , but it was vain .
Then I remembered the Tataka . '
He told Kim the story of the elephant with the leg-iron , as he had told it so often to the Jam priests .
` Further testimony is not needed , ' he ended serenely .
` Thou wast sent for an aid .
That aid removed , my Search came to naught .
Therefore we will go out again together , and our Search sure . '
` Whither go we ? '
` What matters , Friend of all the World ?
The Search , I say , is sure .
If need be , the River will break from the ground before us .
I acquired merit when I sent thee to the Gates of Learning , and gave thee the jewel that is Wisdom .
Thou didst return , I saw even now , a follower of Sakyamuni , the Physician , whose altars are many in Bhotiyal .
It is sufficient .
We are together , and all things are as they were -- Friend of all the World -- Friend of the Stars -- my chela ! '
Then they talked of matters secular ; but it was noticeable that the lama never demanded any details of life at St Xavier 's , nor showed the faintest curiosity as to the manners and customs of Sahibs .
His mind moved all in the past , and he revived every step of their wonderful first journey together , rubbing his hands and chuckling , till it pleased him to curl himself up into the sudden sleep of old age .
Kim watched the last dusty sunshine fade out of the court , and played with his ghost-dagger and rosary .
The clamour of Benares , oldest of all earth 's cities awake before the Gods , day and night , beat round the walls as the sea 's roar round a breakwater .
Now and again , a Jain priest crossed the court , with some small offering to the images , and swept the path about him lest by chance he should take the life of a living thing .
A lamp twinkled , and there followed the sound of a prayer .
Kim watched the stars as they rose one after another in the still , sticky dark , till he fell asleep at the foot of the altar .
That night he dreamed in Hindustani , with never an English word ... ` Holy One , there is the child to whom we gave the medicine , ' he said , about three o'clock in the morning , when the lama , also waking from dreams , would have fared forth on pilgrimage .
` The Jat will be here at the light . ' '
I am well answered .
In my haste I would have done a wrong . '
He sat down on the cushions and returned to his rosary .
` Surely old folk are as children , ' he said pathetically .
` They desire a matter -- behold , it must be done at once , or they fret and weep !
Many times when I was upon the Road I have been ready to stamp with my feet at the hindrance of an ox-cart in the way , or a mere cloud of dust .
It was not so when I was a man -- a long time ago .
None the less it is wrongful -- ' ` But thou art indeed old , Holy One . '
` The thing was done .
A Cause was put out into the world , and , old or young , sick or sound , knowing or unknowing , who can rein in the effect of that Cause ?
Does the Wheel hang still if a child spin it -- or a drunkard ?
Chela , this is a great and a terrible world . ' '
I think it good , ' Kim yawned .
` What is there to eat ?
I have not eaten since yesterday even . ' '
I had forgotten thy need .
Yonder is good Bhotiyal tea and cold rice . '
` We can not walk far on such stuff . '
Kim felt all the European 's lust for flesh-meat , which is not accessible in a Jain temple .
Yet , instead of going out at once with the begging-bowl , he stayed his stomach on slabs of cold rice till the full dawn .
It brought the farmer , voluble , stuttering with gratitude .
` In the night the fever broke and the sweat came , ' he cried .
` Feel here -- his skin is fresh and new !
He esteemed the salt lozenges , and took milk with greed . '
He drew the cloth from the child 's face , and it smiled sleepily at Kim .
A little knot of Jain priests , silent but all-observant , gathered by the temple door .
They knew , and Kim knew that they knew , how the old lama had met his disciple .
Being courteous folk , they had not obtruded themselves overnight by presence , word , or gesture .
Wherefore Kim repaid them as the sun rose .
` Thank the Gods of the Jains , brother , ' he said , not knowing how those Gods were named .
` The fever is indeed broken . '
` Look !
See ! '
The lama beamed in the background upon his hosts of three years .
` Was there ever such a chela ?
He follows our Lord the Healer . '
Now the Jains officially recognize all the Gods of the Hindu creed , as well as the Lingam and the Snake .
They wear the Brahminical thread ; they adhere to every claim of Hindu caste-law .
But , because they knew and loved the lama , because he was an old man , because he sought the Way , because he was their guest , and because he collogued long of nights with the head-priest -- as free-thinking a metaphysician as ever split one hair into seventy -- they murmured assent .
` Remember , ' -- Kim bent over the child -- .
` this trouble may come again . '
` Not if thou hast the proper spell , ' said the father .
` But in a little while we go away . '
` True , ' said the lama to all the Jains .
` We go now together upon the Search whereof I have often spoken .
I waited till my chela was ripe .
Behold him !
We go North .
Never again shall I look upon this place of my rest , O people of good will . '
` But I am not a beggar . '
The cultivator rose to his feet , clutching the child .
` Be still .
Do not trouble the Holy One , ' a priest cried .
` Go , ' Kim whispered .
` Meet us again under the big railway bridge , and for the sake of all the Gods of our Punjab , bring food -- curry , pulse , cakes fried in fat , and sweetmeats .
Specially sweetmeats .
Be swift ! '
The pallor of hunger suited Kim very well as he stood , tall and slim , in his sand-coloured , sweeping robes , one hand on his rosary and the other in the attitude of benediction , faithfully copied from the lama .
An English observer might have said that he looked rather like the young saint of a stained-glass window , whereas he was but a growing lad faint with emptiness .
Long and formal were the farewells , thrice ended and thrice renewed .
The Seeker -- he who had invited the lama to that haven from far-away Tibet , a silver-faced , hairless ascetic -- took no part in it , but meditated , as always , alone among the images .
The others were very human ; pressing small comforts upon the old man -- a betel-box , a fine new iron pencase , a food-bag , and such-like -- warning him against the dangers of the world without , and prophesying a happy end to the Search .
Meantime Kim , lonelier than ever , squatted on the steps , and swore to himself in the language of St Xavier 's .
` But it is my own fault , ' he concluded .
` With Mahbub , I ate Mahbub 's bread , or Lurgan Sahib 's .
At St Xavier 's , three meals a day .
Here I must jolly-well look out for myself .
Besides , I am not in good training .
How I could eat a plate of beef now !
... Is it finished , Holy One ? '
The lama , both hands raised , intoned a final blessing in ornate Chinese . '
I must lean on thy shoulder , ' said he , as the temple gates closed .
` We grow stiff , I think . '
The weight of a six-foot man is not light to steady through miles of crowded streets , and Kim , loaded down with bundles and packages for the way , was glad to reach the shadow of the railway bridge .
` Here we eat , ' he said resolutely , as the Kamboh , blue-robed and smiling , hove in sight , a basket in one hand and the child in the other .
` Fall to , Holy Ones ! '
he cried from fifty yards .
-LRB- They were by the shoal under the first bridge-span , out of sight of hungry priests . -RRB-
` Rice and good curry , cakes all warm and well scented with hing -LSB- asafoetida -RSB- , curds and sugar .
King of my fields , ' -- this to the small son -- ` let us show these holy men that we Jats of Jullundur can pay a service ... I had heard the Jains would eat nothing that they had not cooked , but truly ' -- he looked away politely over the broad river -- ` where there is no eye there is no caste . '
` And we , ' said Kim , turning his back and heaping a leafplatter for the lama , ` are beyond all castes . '
They gorged themselves on the good food in silence .
Nor till he had licked the last of the sticky sweetstuff from his little finger did Kim note that the Kamboh too was girt for travel .
` If our roads lie together , ' he said roughly , ' I go with thee .
One does not often find a worker of miracles , and the child is still weak .
But I am not altogether a reed . '
He picked up his lathi -- a five-foot male-bamboo ringed with bands of polished iron -- and flourished it in the air .
` The Jats are called quarrel-some , but that is not true .
Except when we are crossed , we are like our own buffaloes . '
` So be it , ' said Kim . '
A good stick is a good reason . '
The lama gazed placidly up-stream , where in long , smudged perspective the ceaseless columns of smoke go up from the burning-ghats by the river .
Now and again , despite all municipal regulations , the fragment of a half-burned body bobbed by on the full current .
` But for thee , ' said the Kamboh to Kim , drawing the child into his hairy breast , ' I might today have gone thither -- with this one .
The priests tell us that Benares is holy -- which none doubt -- and desirable to die in .
But I do not know their Gods , and they ask for money ; and when one has done one worship a shaved-head vows it is of none effect except one do another .
Wash here !
Wash there !
Pour , drink , lave , and scatter flowers -- but always pay the priests .
No , the Punjab for me , and the soil of the Jullundur-doab for the best soil in it . ' '
I have said many times -- in the Temple , I think -- that if need be , the River will open at our feet .
We will therefore go North , ' said the lama , rising . '
I remember a pleasant place , set about with fruit-trees , where one can walk in meditation -- and the air is cooler there .
It comes from the Hills and the snow of the Hills . '
` What is the name ? '
said Kim .
` How should I know ?
Didst thou not -- no , that was after the Army rose out of the earth and took thee away .
I abode there in meditation in a room against the dovecot -- except when she talked eternally . '
` Oho !
the woman from Kulu .
That is by Saharunpore . '
Kim laughed .
` How does the spirit move thy master ?
Does he go afoot , for the sake of past sins ? '
the Jat demanded cautiously .
` It is a far cry to Delhi . '
` No , ' said Kim . '
I will beg a tikkut for the te-rain . '
One does not own to the possession of money in India .
` Then , in the name of the Gods , let us take the fire-carriage .
My son is best in his mother 's arms .
The Government has brought on us many taxes , but it gives us one good thing -- the te-rain that joins friends and unites the anxious .
A wonderful matter is the te-rain . '
They all piled into it a couple of hours later , and slept through the heat of the day .
The Kamboh plied Kim with ten thousand questions as to the lama 's walk and work in life , and received some curious answers .
Kim was content to be where he was , to look out upon the flat North-Western landscape , and to talk to the changing mob of fellow-passengers .
Even today , tickets and ticket-clipping are dark oppression to Indian rustics .
They do not understand why , when they have paid for a magic piece of paper , strangers should punch great pieces out of the charm .
So , long and furious are the debates between travellers and Eurasian ticket-collectors .
Kim assisted at two or three with grave advice , meant to darken counsel and to show off his wisdom before the lama and the admiring Kamboh .
But at Somna Road the Fates sent him a matter to think upon .
There tumbled into the compartment , as the train was moving off , a mean , lean little person -- a Mahratta , so far as Kim could judge by the cock of the tight turban .
His face was cut , his muslin upper-garment was badly torn , and one leg was bandaged .
He told them that a country-cart had upset and nearly slain him : he was going to Delhi , where his son lived .
Kim watched him closely .
If , as he asserted , he had been rolled over and over on the earth , there should have been signs of gravel-rash on the skin .
But all his injuries seemed clean cuts , and a mere fall from a cart could not cast a man into such extremity of terror .
As , with shaking fingers , he knotted up the torn cloth about his neck he laid bare an amulet of the kind called a keeper-up of the heart .
Now , amulets are common enough , but they are not generally strung on square-plaited copper wire , and still fewer amulets bear black enamel on silver .
There were none except the Kamboh and the lama in the compartment , which , luckily , was of an old type with solid ends .
Kim made as to scratch in his bosom , and thereby lifted his own amulet .
The Mahratta 's face changed altogether at the sight , and he disposed the amulet fairly on his breast .
` Yes , ' he went on to the Kamboh , ' I was in haste , and the cart , driven by a bastard , bound its wheel in a water-cut , and besides the harm done to me there was lost a full dish of tarkeean .
I was not a Son of the Charm -LSB- a lucky man -RSB- that day . '
` That was a great loss , ' said the Kamboh , withdrawing interest .
His experience of Benares had made him suspicious .
` Who cooked it ? '
said Kim . '
A woman . '
The Mahratta raised his eyes .
` But all women can cook tarkeean , ' said the Kamboh .
` It is a good curry , as I know . '
` Oh yes , it is a good curry , ' said the Mahratta .
` And cheap , ' said Kim .
` But what about caste ? '
` Oh , there is no caste where men go to -- look for tarkeean , ' the Mahratta replied , in the prescribed cadence .
` Of whose service art thou ? '
` Of the service of this Holy One . '
Kim pointed to the happy , drowsy lama , who woke with a jerk at the well-loved word .
` Ah , he was sent from Heaven to aid me .
He is called the Friend of all the World .
He is also called the Friend of the Stars .
He walks as a physician -- his time being ripe .
Great is his wisdom . '
` And a Son of the Charm , ' said Kim under his breath , as the Kamboh made haste to prepare a pipe lest the Mahratta should beg .
` And who is that ? '
the Mahratta asked , glancing sideways nervously .
` One whose child I -- we have cured , who lies under great debt to us .
Sit by the window , man from Jullundur .
Here is a sick one . '
` Humph !
I have no desire to mix with chance-met wastrels .
My ears are not long .
I am not a woman wishing to overhear secrets . '
The Jat slid himself heavily into a far corner .
` Art thou anything of a healer ?
I am ten leagues deep in calamity , ' cried the Mahratta , picking up the cue .
` This man is cut and bruised all over .
I go about to cure him , ' Kim retorted .
` None interfered between thy babe and me . ' '
I am rebuked , ' said the Kamboh meekly . '
I am thy debtor for the life of my son .
Thou art a miracle-worker -- I know it . '
` Show me the cuts . '
Kim bent over the Mahratta 's neck , his heart nearly choking him ; for this was the Great Game with a vengeance .
` Now , tell thy tale swiftly , brother , while I say a charm . ' '
I come from the South , where my work lay .
One of us they slew by the roadside .
Hast thou heard ? '
Kim shook his head .
He , of course , knew nothing of E 's predecessor , slain down South in the habit of an Arab trader .
` Having found a certain letter which I was sent to seek , I came away .
I escaped from the city and ran to Mhow .
So sure was I that none knew , I did not change my face .
At Mhow a woman brought charge against me of theft of jewellery in that city which I had left .
Then I saw the cry was out against me .
I ran from Mhow by night , bribing the police , who had been bribed to hand me over without question to my enemies in the South .
Then I lay in old Chitor city a week , a penitent in a temple , but I could not get rid of the letter which was my charge .
I buried it under the Queen 's Stone , at Chitor , in the place known to us all . '
Kim did not know , but not for worlds would he have broken the thread .
` At Chitor , look you , I was all in Kings ' country ; for Kotah to the east is beyond the Queen 's law , and east again lie Jaipur and Gwalior .
Neither love spies , and there is no justice .
I was hunted like a wet jackal ; but I broke through at Bandakui , where I heard there was a charge against me of murder in the city I had left -- of the murder of a boy .
They have both the corpse and the witnesses waiting . '
` But can not the Government protect ? '
` We of the Game are beyond protection .
If we die , we die .
Our names are blotted from the book .
That is all .
At Bandakui , where lives one of Us , I thought to slip the scent by changing my face , and so made me a Mahratta .
Then I came to Agra , and would have turned back to Chitor to recover the letter .
So sure I was I had slipped them .
Therefore I did not send a tar -LSB- telegram -RSB- to any one saying where the letter lay .
I wished the credit of it all . '
Kim nodded .
He understood that feeling well .
` But at Agra , walking in the streets , a man cried a debt against me , and approaching with many witnesses , would hale me to the courts then and there .
Oh , they are clever in the South !
He recognized me as his agent for cotton .
May he burn in Hell for it ! '
` And wast thou ? ' '
O fool !
I was the man they sought for the matter of the letter !
I ran into the Fleshers ' Ward and came out by the House of the Jew , who feared a riot and pushed me forth .
I came afoot to Somna Road -- I had only money for my tikkut to Delhi -- and there , while I lay in a ditch with a fever , one sprang out of the bushes and beat me and cut me and searched me from head to foot .
Within earshot of the terain it was ! '
` Why did he not slay thee out of hand ? '
` They are not so foolish .
If I am taken in Delhi at the instance of lawyers , upon a proven charge of murder , my body is handed over to the State that desires it .
I go back guarded , and then -- I die slowly for an example to the rest of Us .
The South is not my country .
I run in circles -- like a goat with one eye .
I have not eaten for two days .
I am marked ' -- he touched the filthy bandage on his leg -- ` so that they will know me at Delhi . '
` Thou art safe in the te-rain , at least . '
` Live a year at the Great Game and tell me that again !
The wires will be out against me at Delhi , describing every tear and rag upon me .
Twenty -- a hundred , if need be -- will have seen me slay that boy .
And thou art useless ! '
Kim knew enough of native methods of attack not to doubt that the case would be deadly complete -- even to the corpse .
The Mahratta twitched his fingers with pain from time to time .
The Kamboh in his corner glared sullenly ; the lama was busy over his beads ; and Kim , fumbling doctor-fashion at the man 's neck , thought out his plan between invocations .
` Hast thou a charm to change my shape ?
Else I am dead .
Five -- ten minutes alone , if I had not been so pressed , and I might -- ' ` Is he cured yet , miracle-worker ? '
said the Kamboh jealously .
` Thou hast chanted long enough . '
` Nay .
There is no cure for his hurts , as I see , except he sit for three days in the habit of a bairagi . '
This is a common penance , often imposed on a fat trader by his spiritual teacher .
` One priest always goes about to make another priest , ' was the retort .
Like most grossly superstitious folk , the Kamboh could not keep his tongue from deriding his Church .
` Will thy son be a priest , then ?
It is time he took more of my quinine . '
` We Jats are all buffaloes , ' said the Kamboh , softening anew .
Kim rubbed a finger-tip of bitterness on the child 's trusting little lips . '
I have asked for nothing , ' he said sternly to the father , ` except food .
Dost thou grudge me that ?
I go to heal another man .
Have I thy leave -- Prince ? '
Up flew the man 's huge paws in supplication .
` Nay -- nay .
Do not mock me thus . '
` It pleases me to cure this sick one .
Thou shalt acquire merit by aiding .
What colour ash is there in thy pipe-bowl ?
White .
That is auspicious .
Was there raw turmeric among thy foodstuffs ? '
` I -- I -- ' ` Open thy bundle ! '
It was the usual collection of small oddments : bits of cloth , quack medicines , cheap fairings , a clothful of atta -- greyish , rough-ground native flour -- twists of down-country tobacco , tawdry pipe-stems , and a packet of curry-stuff , all wrapped in a quilt .
Kim turned it over with the air of a wise warlock , muttering a Mohammedan invocation .
` This is wisdom I learned from the Sahibs , ' he whispered to the lama ; and here , when one thinks of his training at Lurgan 's , he spoke no more than the truth .
` There is a great evil in this man 's fortune , as shown by the Stars , which -- which troubles him .
Shall I take it away ? '
` Friend of the Stars , thou hast done well in all things .
Let it be at thy pleasure .
Is it another healing ? '
` Quick !
Be quick ! '
gasped the Mahratta .
` The train may stop . ' '
A healing against the shadow of death , ' said Kim , mixing the Kamboh 's flour with the mingled charcoal and tobacco ash in the red-earth bowl of the pipe .
E , without a word , slipped off his turban and shook down his long black hair .
` That is my food -- priest , ' the jat growled . '
A buffalo in the temple !
Hast thou dared to look even thus far ? '
said Kim . '
I must do mysteries before fools ; but have a care for thine eyes .
Is there a film before them already ?
I save the babe , and for return thou -- oh , shameless ! '
The man flinched at the direct gaze , for Kim was wholly in earnest .
` Shall I curse thee , or shall I -- ' He picked up the outer cloth of the bundle and threw it over the bowed head .
` Dare so much as to think a wish to see , and -- and -- even I can not save thee .
Sit !
Be dumb ! ' '
I am blind -- dumb .
Forbear to curse !
Co -- come , child ; we will play a game of hiding .
Do not , for my sake , look from under the cloth . ' '
I see hope , ' said E23 .
` What is thy scheme ? '
` This comes next , ' said Kim , plucking the thin body-shirt .
E23 hesitated , with all a North-West man 's dislike of baring his body .
` What is caste to a cut throat ? '
said Kim , rending it to the waist .
` We must make thee a yellow Saddhu all over .
Strip -- strip swiftly , and shake thy hair over thine eyes while I scatter the ash .
Now , a caste-mark on thy forehead . '
He drew from his bosom the little Survey paint-box and a cake of crimson lake .
` Art thou only a beginner ? '
said E23 , labouring literally for the dear life , as he slid out of his body-wrappings and stood clear in the loin-cloth while Kim splashed in a noble caste-mark on the ash-smeared brow .
` But two days entered to the Game , brother , ' Kim replied .
` Smear more ash on the bosom . '
` Hast thou met -- a physician of sick pearls ? '
He switched out his long , tight-rolled turban-cloth and , with swiftest hands , rolled it over and under about his loins into the intricate devices of a Saddhu 's cincture .
` Hah !
Dost thou know his touch , then ?
He was my teacher for a while .
We must bar thy legs .
Ash cures wounds .
Smear it again . ' '
I was his pride once , but thou art almost better .
The Gods are kind to us !
Give me that . '
It was a tin box of opium pills among the rubbish of the Jat 's bundle .
E23 gulped down a half handful .
` They are good against hunger , fear , and chill .
And they make the eyes red too , ' he explained .
` Now I shall have heart to play the Game .
We lack only a Saddhu 's tongs .
What of the old clothes ? '
Kim rolled them small , and stuffed them into the slack folds of his tunic .
With a yellow-ochre paint cake he smeared the legs and the breast , great streaks against the background of flour , ash , and turmeric .
` The blood on them is enough to hang thee , brother . '
` Maybe ; but no need to throw them out of the window ... It is finished . '
His voice thrilled with a boy 's pure delight in the Game .
` Turn and look , O Jat ! '
` The Gods protect us , ' said the hooded Kamboh , emerging like a buffalo from the reeds .
` But -- whither went the Mahratta ?
What hast thou done ? '
Kim had been trained by Lurgan Sahib ; E23 , by virtue of his business , was no bad actor .
In place of the tremulous , shrinking trader there lolled against the corner an all but naked , ash-smeared , ochre-barred , dusty-haired Saddhu , his swollen eyes -- opium takes quick effect on an empty stomach -- luminous with insolence and bestial lust , his legs crossed under him , Kim 's brown rosary round his neck , and a scant yard of worn , flowered chintz on his shoulders .
The child buried his face in his amazed father 's arms .
` Look up , Princeling !
We travel with warlocks , but they will not hurt thee .
Oh , do not cry ... What is the sense of curing a child one day and killing him with fright the next ? '
` The child will be fortunate all his life .
He has seen a great healing .
When I was a child I made clay men and horses . ' '
I have made them too .
Sir Banas , he comes in the night and makes them all alive at the back of our kitchen-midden , ' piped the child .
` And so thou art not frightened at anything .
Eh , Prince ? ' '
I was frightened because my father was frightened .
I felt his arms shake . '
` Oh , chicken-man ! '
said Kim , and even the abashed Jat laughed . '
I have done a healing on this poor trader .
He must forsake his gains and his account-books , and sit by the wayside three nights to overcome the malignity of his enemies .
The Stars are against him . '
` The fewer money-lenders the better , say I ; but , Saddhu or no Saddhu , he should pay for my stuff on his shoulders . '
` So ?
But that is thy child on thy shoulder -- given over to the burning-ghat not two days ago .
There remains one thing more .
I did this charm in thy presence because need was great .
I changed his shape and his soul .
None the less , if , by any chance , O man from Jullundur , thou rememberest what thou hast seen , either among the elders sitting under the village tree , or in thine own house , or in company of thy priest when he blesses thy cattle , a murrain will come among the buffaloes , and a fire in thy thatch , and rats in the corn-bins , and the curse of our Gods upon thy fields that they may be barren before thy feet and after thy ploughshare . '
This was part of an old curse picked up from a fakir by the Taksali Gate in the days of Kim 's innocence .
It lost nothing by repetition .
` Cease , Holy One !
In mercy , cease ! '
cried the Jat .
` Do not curse the household .
I saw nothing !
I heard nothing !
I am thy cow ! '
and he made to grab at Kim 's bare foot beating rhythmically on the carriage floor .
` But since thou hast been permitted to aid me in the matter of a pinch of flour and a little opium and such trifles as I have honoured by using in my art , so will the Gods return a blessing , ' and he gave it at length , to the man 's immense relief .
It was one that he had learned from Lurgan Sahib .
The lama stared through his spectacles as he had not stared at the business of disguisement .
` Friend of the Stars , ' he said at last , ` thou hast acquired great wisdom .
Beware that it do not give birth to pride .
No man having the Law before his eyes speaks hastily of any matter which he has seen or encountered . '
` No -- no -- no , indeed , ' cried the farmer , fearful lest the master should be minded to improve on the pupil .
E23 , with relaxed mouth , gave himself up to the opium that is meat , tobacco , and medicine to the spent Asiatic .
So , in a silence of awe and great miscomprehension , they slid into Delhi about lamp-lighting time .
Chapter 12 Who hath desired the Sea -- the sight of salt-water unbounded ?
The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded ?
The sleek-barrelled swell before storm -- grey , foamless , enormous , and growing ?
Stark calm on the lap of the Line -- or the crazy-eyed hurricane blowing ?
His Sea in no showing the same -- his Sea and the same ` neath all showing -- His Sea that his being fulfils ?
So and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise hill-men desire their Hills !
The Sea and the Hills . '
I have found my heart again , ' said E23 , under cover of the platform 's tumult .
` Hunger and fear make men dazed , or I might have thought of this escape before .
I was right .
They come to hunt for me .
Thou hast saved my head . '
A group of yellow-trousered Punjab policemen , headed by a hot and perspiring young Englishman , parted the crowd about the carriages .
Behind them , inconspicuous as a cat , ambled a small fat person who looked like a lawyer 's tout .
` See the young Sahib reading from a paper .
My description is in his hand , ' said E23 .
` Thev go carriage by carriage , like fisher-folk netting a pool . '
When the procession reached their compartment , E23 was counting his beads with a steady jerk of the wrist ; while Kim jeered at him for being so drugged as to have lost the ringed fire-tongs which are the Saddhu 's distinguishing mark .
The lama , deep in meditation , stared straight before him ; and the farmer , glancing furtively , gathered up his belongings .
` Nothing here but a parcel of holy-bolies , ' said the Englishman aloud , and passed on amid a ripple of uneasiness ; for native police mean extortion to the native all India over .
` The trouble now , ' whispered E23 , ` lies in sending a wire as to the place where I hid that letter I was sent to find .
I can not go to the tar-office in this guise . '
` Is it not enough I have saved thy neck ? '
` Not if the work be left unfinished .
Did never the healer of sick pearls tell thee so ?
Comes another Sahib !
Ah ! '
This was a tallish , sallowish District Superintendent of Police -- belt , helmet , polished spurs and all -- strutting and twirling his dark moustache .
` What fools are these Police Sahibs ! '
said Kim genially .
E23 glanced up under his eyelids .
` It is well said , ' he muttered in a changed voice . '
I go to drink water .
Keep my place . '
He blundered out almost into the Englishman 's arms , and was bad-worded in clumsy Urdu .
` Tum mut ?
You drunk ?
You must n't bang about as though Delhi station belonged to you , my friend . '
E23 , not moving a muscle of his countenance , answered with a stream of the filthiest abuse , at which Kim naturally rejoiced .
It reminded him of the drummer-boys and the barrack-sweepers at Umballa in the terrible time of his first schooling .
` My good fool , ' the Englishman drawled .
` Nickle-jao !
Go back to your carriage . '
Step by step , withdrawing deferentially and dropping his voice , the yellow Saddhu clomb back to the carriage , cursing the D.S.P. to remotest posterity , by -- here Kim almost jumped -- by the curse of the Queen 's Stone , by the writing under the Queen 's Stone , and by an assortment of Gods with wholly , new names . '
I do n't know what you 're saying , ' -- the Englishman flushed angrily -- ` but it 's some piece of blasted impertinence .
Come out of that ! '
E23 , affecting to misunderstand , gravely produced his ticket , which the Englishman wrenched angrily from his hand .
` Oh , zoolum !
What oppression ! '
growled the Jat from his corner .
` All for the sake of a jest too . '
He had been grinning at the freedom of the Saddhu 's tongue .
` Thy charms do not work well today , Holy One ! '
The Saddhu followed the policeman , fawning and supplicating .
The ruck of passengers , busy , with their babies and their bundles , had not noticed the affair .
Kim slipped out behind him ; for it flashed through his head that he had heard this angry , stupid Sahib discoursing loud personalities to an old lady near Umballa three years ago .
` It is well ' , the Saddhu whispered , jammed in the calling , shouting , bewildered press -- a Persian greyhound between his feet and a cageful of yelling hawks under charge of a Rajput falconer in the small of his back .
` He has gone now to send word of the letter which I hid .
They told me he was in Peshawur .
I might have known that he is like the crocodile -- always at the other ford .
He has saved me from present calamity , but I owe my life to thee . '
` Is he also one of Us ? '
Kim ducked under a Mewar camel-driver 's greasy armpit and cannoned off a covey of jabbering Sikh matrons .
` Not less than the greatest .
We are both fortunate !
I will make report to him of what thou hast done .
I am safe under his protection . '
He bored through the edge of the crowd besieging the carriages , and squatted by the bench near the telegraph-office .
` Return , or they take thy place !
Have no fear for the work , brother -- or my life .
Thou hast given me breathing-space , and Strickland Sahib has pulled me to land .
We may work together at the Game yet .
Farewell ! '
Kim hurried to his carriage : elated , bewildered , but a little nettled in that he had no key to the secrets about him . '
I am only a beginner at the Game , that is sure .
I could not have leaped into safety as did the Saddhu .
He knew it was darkest under the lamp .
I could not have thought to tell news under pretence of cursing ... and how clever was the Sahib !
No matter , I saved the life of one ... Where is the Kamboh gone , Holy One ? '
he whispered , as he took his seat in the now crowded compartment . '
A fear gripped him , ' the lama replied , with a touch of tender malice .
` He saw thee change the Mahratta to a Saddhu in the twinkling of an eye , as a protection against evil .
That shook him .
Then he saw the Saddhu fall sheer into the hands of the polis -- all the effect of thy art .
Then he gathered up his son and fled ; for he said that thou didst change a quiet trader into an impudent bandier of words with the Sahibs , and he feared a like fate .
Where is the Saddhu ? '
` With the polis , ' said Kim ... ` Yet I saved the Kamboh 's child . '
The lama snuffed blandly .
` Ah , chela , see how thou art overtaken !
Thou didst cure the Kamboh 's child solely to acquire merit .
But thou didst put a spell on the Mahratta with prideful workings -- I watched thee -- and with sidelong glances to bewilder an old old man and a foolish farmer : whence calamity and suspicion . '
Kim controlled himself with an effort beyond his years .
Not more than any other youngster did he like to eat dirt or to be misjudged , but he saw himself in a cleft stick .
The train rolled out of Delhi into the night .
` It is true , ' he murmured .
` Where I have offended thee I have done wrong . '
` It is more , chela .
Thou hast loosed an Act upon the world , and as a stone thrown into a pool so spread the consequences thou canst not tell how far . '
This ignorance was well both for Kim 's vanity and for the lama 's peace of mind , when we think that there was then being handed in at Simla a code-wire reporting the arrival of E23 at Delhi , and , more important , the whereabouts of a letter he had been commissioned to -- abstract .
Incidentally , an over-zealous policeman had arrested , on charge of murder done in a far southern State , a horribly indignant Ajmir cotton-broker , who was explaining himself to a Mr Strickland on Delhi platform , while E23 was paddling through byways into the locked heart of Delhi city .
In two hours several telegrams had reached the angry minister of a southern State reporting that all trace of a somewhat bruised Mahratta had been lost ; and by the time the leisurely train halted at Saharunpore the last ripple of the stone Kim had helped to heave was lapping against the steps of a mosque in far-away Roum -- where it disturbed a pious man at prayers .
The lama made his in ample form near the dewy bougainvillea-trellis near the platform , cheered by the clear sunshine and the presence of his disciple .
` We will put these things behind us , ' he said , indicating the brazen engine and the gleaming track .
` The jolting of the te-rain -- though a wonderful thing -- has turned my bones to water .
We will use clean air henceforward . '
` Let us go to the Kulu woman 's house ' said Kim , and stepped forth cheerily under the bundles .
Early morning Saharunpore-way is clean and well scented .
He thought of the other mornings at St Xavier 's , and it topped his already thrice-heaped contentment .
` Where is this new haste born from ?
Wise men do not run about like chickens in the sun .
We have come hundreds upon hundreds of koss already , and , till now , I have scarcely been alone with thee an instant .
How canst thou receive instruction all jostled of crowds ?
How can I , whelmed by a flux of talk , meditate upon the Way ? '
` Her tongue grows no shorter with the years , then ? '
the disciple smiled .
` Nor her desire for charms .
I remember once when I spoke of the Wheel of Life ' -- the lama fumbled in his bosom for his latest copy -- ` she was only curious about the devils that besiege children .
She shall acquire merit by entertaining us -- in a little while -- at an after-occasion -- softly , softly .
Now we will wander loose-foot , waiting upon the Chain of Things .
The Search is sure . '
So they travelled very easily across and among the broad bloomful fruit-gardens -- by way of Aminabad , Sahaigunge , Akrola of the Ford , and little Phulesa -- the line of the Siwaliks always to the north , and behind them again the snows .
After long , sweet sleep under the dry stars came the lordly , leisurely passage through a waking village -- begging-bowl held forth in silence , but eyes roving in defiance of the Law from sky 's edge to sky 's edge .
Then would Kim return soft-footed through the soft dust to his master under the shadow of a mango-tree or the thinner shade of a white Doon siris , to eat and drink at ease .
At mid-day , after talk and a little wayfaring , they slept ; meeting the world refreshed when the air was cooler .
Night found them adventuring into new territory -- some chosen village spied three hours before across the fat land , and much discussed upon the road .
There they told their tale -- a new one each evening so far as Kim was concerned -- and there were they made welcome , either by priest or headman , after the custom of the kindly East .
When the shadows shortened and the lama leaned more heavily upon Kim , there was always the Wheel of Life to draw forth , to hold flat under wiped stones , and with a long straw to expound cycle by cycle .
Here sat the Gods on high -- and they were dreams of dreams .
Here was our Heaven and the world of the demi-Gods -- horsemen fighting among the hills .
Here were the agonies done upon the beasts , souls ascending or descending the ladder and therefore not to be interfered with .
Here were the Hells , hot and cold , and the abodes of tormented ghosts .
Let the chela study the troubles that come from over-eating -- bloated stomach and burning bowels .
Obediently , then , with bowed head and brown finger alert to follow the pointer , did the chela study ; but when they came to the Human World , busy and profitless , that is just above the Hells , his mind was distracted ; for by the roadside trundled the very Wheel itself , eating , drinking , trading , marrying , and quarrelling -- all warmly alive .
Often the lama made the living pictures the matter of his text , bidding Kim -- too ready -- note how the flesh takes a thousand shapes , desirable or detestable as men reckon , but in truth of no account either way ; and how the stupid spirit , bond-slave to the Hog , the Dove , and the Serpent -- lusting after betel-nut , a new yoke of oxen , women , or the favour of kings -- is bound to follow the body through all the Heavens and all the Hells , and strictly round again .
Sometimes a woman or a poor man , watching the ritual -- it was nothing less -- when the great yellow chart was unfolded , would throw a few flowers or a handful of cowries upon its edge .
It sufficed these humble ones that they had met a Holy One who might be moved to remember them in his prayers .
` Cure them if they are sick , ' said the lama , when Kim 's sporting instincts woke .
` Cure them if they have fever , but by no means work charms .
Remember what befell the Mahratta . '
` Then all Doing is evil ? '
Kim replied , lying out under a big tree at the fork of the Doon road , watching the little ants run over his hand .
` To abstain from action is well -- except to acquire merit . '
` At the Gates of Learning we were taught that to abstain from action was unbefitting a Sahib .
And I am a Sahib . '
` Friend of all the World , ' -- the lama looked directly at Kim -- ' I am an old man -- pleased with shows as are children .
To those who follow the Way there is neither black nor white , Hind nor Bhotiyal .
We be all souls seeking escape .
No matter what thy wisdom learned among Sahibs , when we come to my River thou wilt be freed from all illusion -- at my side .
Hai !
My bones ache for that River , as they ached in the te-rain ; but my spirit sits above my bones , waiting .
The Search is sure ! ' '
