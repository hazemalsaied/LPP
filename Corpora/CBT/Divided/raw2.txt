BLOCKHEAD-HANS Far away in the country lay an old manor-house where lived an old squire who had two sons .
They thought themselves so clever , that if they had known only half of what they did know , it would have been quite enough .
They both wanted to marry the King 's daughter , for she had proclaimed that she would have for her husband the man who knew best how to choose his words .
Both prepared for the wooing a whole week , which was the longest time allowed them ; but , after all , it was quite long enough , for they both had preparatory knowledge , and everyone knows how useful that is .
One knew the whole Latin dictionary and also three years ' issue of the daily paper of the town off by heart , so that he could repeat it all backwards or forwards as you pleased .
The other had worked at the laws of corporation , and knew by heart what every member of the corporation ought to know , so that he thought he could quite well speak on State matters and give his opinion .
He understood , besides this , how to embroider braces with roses and other flowers , and scrolls , for he was very ready with his fingers . '
I shall win the king 's daughter ! '
they both cried .
Their old father gave each of them a fine horse ; the one who knew the dictionary and the daily paper by heart had a black horse , while the other who was so clever at corporation law had a milk-white one .
Then they oiled the corners of their mouths so that they might be able to speak more fluently .
All the servants stood in the courtyard and saw them mount their steeds , and here by chance came the third brother ; for the squire had three sons , but nobody counted him with his brothers , for he was not so learned as they were , and he was generally called ` Blockhead-Hans . '
` Oh , oh ! '
said Blockhead-Hans .
` Where are you off to ?
You are in your Sunday-best clothes ! '
` We are going to Court , to woo the Princess !
Do n't you know what is known throughout all the country side ? '
And they told him all about it .
` Hurrah !
I 'll go to ! '
cried Blockhead-Hans ; and the brothers laughed at him and rode off .
` Dear father ! '
cried Blockhead-Hans , ' I must have a horse too .
What a desire for marriage has seized me !
If she will have me , she WILL have me , and if she wo n't have me , I will have her . '
` Stop that nonsense ! '
said the old man . '
I will not give you a horse .
YOU ca n't speak ; YOU do n't know how to choose your words .
Your brothers !
Ah !
they are very different lads ! '
` Well , ' said Blockhead-Hans , ` if I ca n't have a horse , I will take the goat which is mine ; he can carry me ! '
And he did so .
He sat astride on the goat , struck his heels into its side , and went rattling down the high-road like a hurricane .
` Hoppetty hop !
what a ride ! '
Here I come ! '
shouted Blockhead-Hans , singing so that the echoes were roused far and near .
But his brothers were riding slowly in front .
They were not speaking , but they were thinking over all the good things they were going to say , for everything had to be thought out .
` Hullo ! '
bawled Blockhead-Hans , ` here I am !
Just look what I found on the road ! '
-- and he showed them a dead crow which he had picked up .
` Blockhead ! '
said his brothers , ` what are you going to do with it ? '
` With the crow ?
I shall give it to the Princess ! '
` Do so , certainly ! '
they said , laughing loudly and riding on .
` Slap !
bang !
here I am again !
Look what I have just found !
You do n't find such things every day on the road ! '
And the brothers turned round to see what in the world he could have found .
` Blockhead ! '
said they , ` that is an old wooden shoe without the top !
Are you going to send that , too , to the Princess ? '
` Of course I shall ! '
returned Blockhead-Hans ; and the brothers laughed and rode on a good way .
` Slap !
bang !
here I am ! '
cried Blockhead-Hans ; ` better and better -- it is really famous ! '
` What have you found now ? '
asked the brothers .
` Oh , ' said Blockhead-Hans , ` it is really too good !
How pleased the Princess will be ! '
` Why ! '
said the brothers , ` this is pure mud , straight from the ditch . '
` Of course it is ! '
said Blockhead-Hans , ` and it is the best kind !
Look how it runs through one 's fingers ! '
and , so saying , he filled his pocket with the mud .
But the brothers rode on so fast that dust and sparks flew all around , and they reached the gate of the town a good hour before Blockhead-Hans .
Here came the suitors numbered according to their arrival , and they were ranged in rows , six in each row , and they were so tightly packed that they could not move their arms .
This was a very good thing , for otherwise they would have torn each other in pieces , merely because the one was in front of the other .
All the country people were standing round the King 's throne , and were crowded together in thick masses almost out of the windows to see the Princess receive the suitors ; and as each one came into the room all his fine phrases went out like a candle !
` It does n't matter ! '
said the Princess .
` Away !
out with him ! '
At last she came to the row in which the brother who knew the dictionary by heart was , but he did not know it any longer ; he had quite forgotten it in the rank and file .
And the floor creaked , and the ceiling was all made of glass mirrors , so that he saw himself standing on his head , and by each window were standing three reporters and an editor ; and each of them was writing down what was said , to publish it in the paper that came out and was sold at the street corners for a penny .
It was fearful , and they had made up the fire so hot that it was grilling .
` It is hot in here , is n't it ! '
said the suitor .
` Of course it is !
My father is roasting young chickens to-day ! '
said the Princess .
` Ahem ! '
There he stood like an idiot .
He was not prepared for such a speech ; he did not know what to say , although he wanted to say something witty .
` Ahem ! '
` It does n't matter ! '
said the Princess .
` Take him out ! '
and out he had to go .
Now the other brother entered .
` How hot it is ! '
he said .
` Of course !
We are roasting young chickens to-day ! '
remarked the Princess .
` How do you -- um ! '
he said , and the reporters wrote down .
` How do you -- um . '
` It does n't matter ! '
said the Princess .
` Take him out ! '
Now Blockhead-Hans came in ; he rode his goat right into the hall . '
I say !
How roasting hot it is here ! '
said he .
` Of course !
I am roasting young chickens to-day ! '
said the Princess .
` That 's good ! '
replied Blockhead-Hans ; ` then can I roast a crow with them ? '
` With the greatest of pleasure ! '
said the Princess ; ` but have you anything you can roast them in ?
for I have neither pot nor saucepan . '
` Oh , rather ! '
said Blockhead-Hans .
` Here is a cooking implement with tin rings , ' and he drew out the old wooden shoe , and laid the crow in it .
` That is quite a meal ! '
said the Princess ; ` but where shall we get the soup from ? '
` I 've got that in my pocket ! '
said Blockhead-Hans . '
I have so much that I can quite well throw some away ! '
and he poured some mud out of his pocket . '
I like you ! '
said the Princess .
` You can answer , and you can speak , and I will marry you ; but do you know that every word which we are saying and have said has been taken down and will be in the paper to-morrow ?
By each window do you see there are standing three reporters and an old editor , and this old editor is the worst , for he does n't understand anything ! '
but she only said this to tease Blockhead-Hans .
And the reporters giggled , and each dropped a blot of ink on the floor .
` Ah !
are those the great people ? '
said Blockhead-Hans .
` Then I will give the editor the best ! '
So saying , he turned his pockets inside out , and threw the mud right in his face .
` That was neatly done ! '
said the Princess . '
I could n't have done it ; but I will soon learn how to ! '
Blockhead-Hans became King , got a wife and a crown , and sat on the throne ; and this we have still damp from the newspaper of the editor and the reporters -- and they are not to be believed for a moment .
A STORY ABOUT A DARNING-NEEDLE There was once a Darning-needle who thought herself so fine that she believed she was an embroidery-needle .
` Take great care to hold me tight ! '
said the Darning-needle to the Fingers who were holding her .
` Do n't let me fall !
If I once fall on the ground I shall never be found again , I am so fine ! '
` It is all right ! '
said the Fingers , seizing her round the waist .
` Look , I am coming with my train ! '
said the Darning-needle as she drew a long thread after her ; but there was no knot at the end of the thread .
The Fingers were using the needle on the cook 's shoe .
The upper leather was unstitched and had to be sewn together .
` This is common work ! '
said the Darning-needle . '
I shall never get through it .
I am breaking !
I am breaking ! '
And in fact she did break .
` Did n't I tell you so ! '
said the Darning-needle . '
I am too fine ! '
` Now she is good for nothing ! '
said the Fingers ; but they had to hold her tight while the cook dropped some sealing-wax on the needle and stuck it in the front of her dress .
` Now I am a breast-pin ! '
said the Darning-needle . '
I always knew I should be promoted .
When one is something , one will become something ! '
And she laughed to herself ; you can never see when a Darning-needle is laughing .
Then she sat up as proudly as if she were in a State coach , and looked all round her .
` May I be allowed to ask if you are gold ? '
she said to her neighbour , the Pin .
` You have a very nice appearance , and a peculiar head ; but it is too small !
You must take pains to make it grow , for it is not everyone who has a head of sealing-wax . '
And so saying the Darning-needle raised herself up so proudly that she fell out of the dress , right into the sink which the cook was rinsing out .
` Now I am off on my travels ! '
said the Darning-needle . '
I do hope I sha 'n' t get lost ! '
She did indeed get lost . '
I am too fine for this world ! '
said she as she lay in the gutter ; ` but I know who I am , and that is always a little satisfaction ! '
And the Darning-needle kept her proud bearing and did not lose her good-temper .
All kinds of things swam over her -- shavings , bits of straw , and scraps of old newspapers .
` Just look how they sail along ! '
said the Darning-needle .
` They do n't know what is underneath them !
Here I am sticking fast !
There goes a shaving thinking of nothing in the world but of itself , a mere chip !
There goes a straw -- well , how it does twist and twirl , to be sure !
Do n't think so much about yourself , or you will be knocked against a stone .
There floats a bit of newspaper .
What is written on it is long ago forgotten , and yet how proud it is !
I am sitting patient and quiet .
I know who I am , and that is enough for me ! '
One day something thick lay near her which glittered so brightly that the Darning-needle thought it must be a diamond .
But it was a bit of bottle-glass , and because it sparkled the Darning-needle spoke to it , and gave herself out as a breast-pin .
` No doubt you are a diamond ? '
` Yes , something of that kind ! '
And each believed that the other was something very costly ; and they both said how very proud the world must be of them . '
I have come from a lady 's work-box , ' said Darning-needle , ` and this lady was a cook ; she had five fingers on each hand ; anything so proud as these fingers I have never seen !
And yet they were only there to take me out of the work-box and to put me back again ! '
` Were they of noble birth , then ? '
asked the bit of bottle-glass .
` Of noble birth ! '
said the Darning-needle ; ` no indeed , but proud !
They were five brothers , all called '' Fingers . ''
They held themselves proudly one against the other , although they were of different sizes .
The outside one , the Thumb , was short and fat ; he was outside the rank , and had only one bend in his back , and could only make one bow ; but he said that if he were cut off from a man that he was no longer any use as a soldier .
Dip-into-everything , the second finger , dipped into sweet things as well as sour things , pointed to the sun and the moon , and guided the pen when they wrote .
Longman , the third , looked at the others over his shoulder .
Goldband , the fourth , had a gold sash round his waist ; and little Playman did nothing at all , and was the more proud .
There was too much ostentation , and so I came away . '
` And now we are sitting and shining here ! '
said the bit of bottle-glass .
At that moment more water came into the gutter ; it streamed over the edges and washed the bit of bottle-glass away .
` Ah !
now he has been promoted ! '
said the Darning-needle . '
I remain here ; I am too fine .
But that is my pride , which is a sign of respectability ! '
And she sat there very proudly , thinking lofty thoughts . '
I really believe I must have been born a sunbeam , I am so fine !
It seems to me as if the sunbeams were always looking under the water for me .
Ah , I am so fine that my own mother can not find me !
If I had my old eye which broke off , I believe I could weep ; but I ca n't -- it is not fine to weep ! '
One day two street-urchins were playing and wading in the gutter , picking up old nails , pennies , and such things .
It was rather dirty work , but it was a great delight to them .
` Oh , oh ! '
cried out one , as he pricked himself with the Darning-needle ; ` he is a fine fellow though ! ' '
I am not a fellow ; I am a young lady ! '
said the Darning-needle ; but no one heard .
The sealing-wax had gone , and she had become quite black ; but black makes one look very slim , and so she thought she was even finer than before .
` Here comes an egg-shell sailing along ! '
said the boys , and they stuck the Darning-needle into the egg-shell .
` The walls white and I black -- what a pretty contrast it makes ! '
said the Darning-needle .
` Now I can be seen to advantage !
If only I am not sea-sick !
I should give myself up for lost ! '
But she was not sea-sick , and did not give herself up .
` It is a good thing to be steeled against sea-sickness ; here one has indeed an advantage over man !
Now my qualms are over .
The finer one is the more one can beat . '
` Crack ! '
said the egg-shell as a wagon-wheel went over it .
` Oh !
how it presses ! '
said the Darning-needle . '
I shall indeed be sea-sick now .
I am breaking ! '
_BOOK_TITLE_ : Lewis_Carroll___Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.txt.out
CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , ` and what is the use of a book , ' thought Alice ` without pictures or conversation ? '
So she was considering in her own mind -LRB- as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid -RRB- , whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that ; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself , ` Oh dear !
Oh dear !
I shall be late ! '
-LRB- when she thought it over afterwards , it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this , but at the time it all seemed quite natural -RRB- ; but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET , and looked at it , and then hurried on , Alice started to her feet , for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket , or a watch to take out of it , and burning with curiosity , she ran across the field after it , and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge .
In another moment down went Alice after it , never once considering how in the world she was to get out again .
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well .
Either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next .
First , she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything ; then she looked at the sides of the well , and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves ; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs .
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled ` ORANGE MARMALADE ' , but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it .
` Well ! '
thought Alice to herself , ` after such a fall as this , I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs !
How brave they 'll all think me at home !
Why , I would n't say anything about it , even if I fell off the top of the house ! '
-LRB- Which was very likely true . -RRB-
Down , down , down .
Would the fall NEVER come to an end ! '
I wonder how many miles I 've fallen by this time ? '
she said aloud . '
I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth .
Let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , I think -- ' -LRB- for , you see , Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to say it over -RRB- ' -- yes , that 's about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I 've got to ? '
-LRB- Alice had no idea what Latitude was , or Longitude either , but thought they were nice grand words to say . -RRB-
Presently she began again . '
I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth !
How funny it 'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward !
The Antipathies , I think -- ' -LRB- she was rather glad there WAS no one listening , this time , as it did n't sound at all the right word -RRB- ' -- but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is , you know .
Please , Ma'am , is this New Zealand or Australia ? '
-LRB- and she tried to curtsey as she spoke -- fancy CURTSEYING as you 're falling through the air !
Do you think you could manage it ? -RRB-
` And what an ignorant little girl she 'll think me for asking !
No , it 'll never do to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere . '
Down , down , down .
There was nothing else to do , so Alice soon began talking again .
` Dinah 'll miss me very much to-night , I should think ! '
-LRB- Dinah was the cat . -RRB- '
I hope they 'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time .
Dinah my dear !
I wish you were down here with me !
There are no mice in the air , I 'm afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that 's very like a mouse , you know .
But do cats eat bats , I wonder ? '
And here Alice began to get rather sleepy , and went on saying to herself , in a dreamy sort of way , ` Do cats eat bats ?
Do cats eat bats ? '
and sometimes , ` Do bats eat cats ? '
for , you see , as she could n't answer either question , it did n't much matter which way she put it .
She felt that she was dozing off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah , and saying to her very earnestly , ` Now , Dinah , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ? '
when suddenly , thump !
thump !
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over .
Alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the White Rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it .
There was not a moment to be lost : away went Alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ` Oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! '
She was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof .
There were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and Alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas !
either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them .
However , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat-hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw .
How she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; ` and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor Alice , ` it would be of very little use without my shoulders .
Oh , how I wish I could shut up like a telescope !
I think I could , if I only know how to begin . '
For , you see , so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately , that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible .
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , -LRB- ` which certainly was not here before , ' said Alice , -RRB- and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ` DRINK ME ' beautifully printed on it in large letters .
It was all very well to say ` Drink me , ' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry .
` No , I 'll look first , ' she said , ` and see whether it 's marked `` poison '' or not ' ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ` poison , ' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .
However , this bottle was NOT marked ` poison , ' so Alice ventured to taste it , and finding it very nice , -LRB- it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart , custard , pine-apple , roast turkey , toffee , and hot buttered toast , -RRB- she very soon finished it off .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ` What a curious feeling ! '
said Alice ; ' I must be shutting up like a telescope . '
And so it was indeed : she was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden .
First , however , she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this ; ` for it might end , you know , ' said Alice to herself , ` in my going out altogether , like a candle .
I wonder what I should be like then ? '
And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out , for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing .
After a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor Alice !
when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .
` Come , there 's no use in crying like that ! '
said Alice to herself , rather sharply ; ' I advise you to leave off this minute ! '
She generally gave herself very good advice , -LRB- though she very seldom followed it -RRB- , and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes ; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself , for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people .
` But it 's no use now , ' thought poor Alice , ` to pretend to be two people !
Why , there 's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person ! '
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which the words ` EAT ME ' were beautifully marked in currants .
` Well , I 'll eat it , ' said Alice , ` and if it makes me grow larger , I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the door ; so either way I 'll get into the garden , and I do n't care which happens ! '
She ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself , ` Which way ?
Which way ? '
, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing , and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size : to be sure , this generally happens when one eats cake , but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen , that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way .
So she set to work , and very soon finished off the cake .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II .
The Pool of Tears ` Curiouser and curiouser ! '
cried Alice -LRB- she was so much surprised , that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English -RRB- ; ` now I 'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was !
Good-bye , feet ! '
-LRB- for when she looked down at her feet , they seemed to be almost out of sight , they were getting so far off -RRB- .
` Oh , my poor little feet , I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ?
I 'm sure I sha n't be able !
I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you : you must manage the best way you can ; -- but I must be kind to them , ' thought Alice , ` or perhaps they wo n't walk the way I want to go !
Let me see : I 'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas . '
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it .
` They must go by the carrier , ' she thought ; ` and how funny it 'll seem , sending presents to one 's own feet !
And how odd the directions will look !
ALICE 'S RIGHT FOOT , ESQ. .
HEARTHRUG , NEAR THE FENDER , -LRB- WITH ALICE 'S LOVE -RRB- .
Oh dear , what nonsense I 'm talking ! '
Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall : in fact she was now more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door .
Poor Alice !
It was as much as she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever : she sat down and began to cry again .
` You ought to be ashamed of yourself , ' said Alice , ' a great girl like you , ' -LRB- she might well say this -RRB- , ` to go on crying in this way !
Stop this moment , I tell you ! '
But she went on all the same , shedding gallons of tears , until there was a large pool all round her , about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall .
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming .
It was the White Rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ` Oh !
the Duchess , the Duchess !
Oh !
wo n't she be savage if I 've kept her waiting ! '
Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the Rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , ` If you please , sir -- ' The Rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go .
Alice took up the fan and gloves , and , as the hall was very hot , she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking : ` Dear , dear !
How queer everything is to-day !
And yesterday things went on just as usual .
I wonder if I 've been changed in the night ?
Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ?
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different .
But if I 'm not the same , the next question is , Who in the world am I ?
Ah , THAT 'S the great puzzle ! '
And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them .
` I 'm sure I 'm not Ada , ' she said , ` for her hair goes in such long ringlets , and mine does n't go in ringlets at all ; and I 'm sure I ca n't be Mabel , for I know all sorts of things , and she , oh !
she knows such a very little !
Besides , SHE 'S she , and I 'm I , and -- oh dear , how puzzling it all is !
I 'll try if I know all the things I used to know .
Let me see : four times five is twelve , and four times six is thirteen , and four times seven is -- oh dear !
I shall never get to twenty at that rate !
However , the Multiplication Table does n't signify : let 's try Geography .
London is the capital of Paris , and Paris is the capital of Rome , and Rome -- no , THAT 'S all wrong , I 'm certain !
I must have been changed for Mabel !
I 'll try and say `` How doth the little -- '' ' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons , and began to repeat it , but her voice sounded hoarse and strange , and the words did not come the same as they used to do : -- ` How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail , And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale !
` How cheerfully he seems to grin , How neatly spread his claws , And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws ! '
` I 'm sure those are not the right words , ' said poor Alice , and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on , ' I must be Mabel after all , and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh !
ever so many lessons to learn !
No , I 've made up my mind about it ; if I 'm Mabel , I 'll stay down here !
It 'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying `` Come up again , dear ! ''
I shall only look up and say `` Who am I then ?
Tell me that first , and then , if I like being that person , I 'll come up : if not , I 'll stay down here till I 'm somebody else '' -- but , oh dear ! '
cried Alice , with a sudden burst of tears , ' I do wish they WOULD put their heads down !
I am so VERY tired of being all alone here ! '
As she said this she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit 's little white kid gloves while she was talking .
` How CAN I have done that ? '
she thought . '
I must be growing small again . '
She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether .
` That WAS a narrow escape ! '
said Alice , a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; ` and now for the garden ! '
and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but , alas !
the little door was shut again , and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before , ` and things are worse than ever , ' thought the poor child , ` for I never was so small as this before , never !
And I declare it 's too bad , that it is ! '
As she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash !
she was up to her chin in salt water .
Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , ` and in that case I can go back by railway , ' she said to herself .
-LRB- Alice had been to the seaside once in her life , and had come to the general conclusion , that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea , some children digging in the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses , and behind them a railway station . -RRB-
However , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high . '
I wish I had n't cried so much ! '
said Alice , as she swam about , trying to find her way out . '
I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being drowned in my own tears !
That WILL be a queer thing , to be sure !
However , everything is queer to-day . '
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .
` Would it be of any use , now , ' thought Alice , ` to speak to this mouse ?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here , that I should think very likely it can talk : at any rate , there 's no harm in trying . '
So she began : ' O Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ?
I am very tired of swimming about here , O Mouse ! '
-LRB- Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before , but she remembered having seen in her brother 's Latin Grammar , ' A mouse -- of a mouse -- to a mouse -- a mouse -- O mouse ! ' -RRB-
The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively , and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes , but it said nothing .
` Perhaps it does n't understand English , ' thought Alice ; ' I daresay it 's a French mouse , come over with William the Conqueror . '
-LRB- For , with all her knowledge of history , Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened . -RRB-
So she began again : ` Ou est ma chatte ? '
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book .
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright .
` Oh , I beg your pardon ! '
cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal 's feelings . '
I quite forgot you did n't like cats . '
` Not like cats ! '
cried the Mouse , in a shrill , passionate voice .
` Would YOU like cats if you were me ? '
` Well , perhaps not , ' said Alice in a soothing tone : ` do n't be angry about it .
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I think you 'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her .
She is such a dear quiet thing , ' Alice went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , ` and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face -- and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse -- and she 's such a capital one for catching mice -- oh , I beg your pardon ! '
cried Alice again , for this time the Mouse was bristling all over , and she felt certain it must be really offended .
` We wo n't talk about her any more if you 'd rather not . '
` We indeed ! '
cried the Mouse , who was trembling down to the end of his tail .
` As if I would talk on such a subject !
Our family always HATED cats : nasty , low , vulgar things !
Do n't let me hear the name again ! ' '
I wo n't indeed ! '
said Alice , in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation .
` Are you -- are you fond -- of -- of dogs ? '
The Mouse did not answer , so Alice went on eagerly : ` There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you !
A little bright-eyed terrier , you know , with oh , such long curly brown hair !
And it 'll fetch things when you throw them , and it 'll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things -- I ca n't remember half of them -- and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says it 's so useful , it 's worth a hundred pounds !
He says it kills all the rats and -- oh dear ! '
cried Alice in a sorrowful tone , ` I 'm afraid I 've offended it again ! '
For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go , and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went .
So she called softly after it , ` Mouse dear !
Do come back again , and we wo n't talk about cats or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! '
When the Mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale -LRB- with passion , Alice thought -RRB- , and it said in a low trembling voice , ` Let us get to the shore , and then I 'll tell you my history , and you 'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs . '
It was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a Duck and a Dodo , a Lory and an Eaglet , and several other curious creatures .
Alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore .
CHAPTER III .
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank -- the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them , and all dripping wet , cross , and uncomfortable .
The first question of course was , how to get dry again : they had a consultation about this , and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them , as if she had known them all her life .
Indeed , she had quite a long argument with the Lory , who at last turned sulky , and would only say , ' I am older than you , and must know better ' ; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was , and , as the Lory positively refused to tell its age , there was no more to be said .
At last the Mouse , who seemed to be a person of authority among them , called out , ` Sit down , all of you , and listen to me !
I 'LL soon make you dry enough ! '
They all sat down at once , in a large ring , with the Mouse in the middle .
Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it , for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon .
` Ahem ! '
said the Mouse with an important air , ` are you all ready ?
This is the driest thing I know .
Silence all round , if you please !
`` William the Conqueror , whose cause was favoured by the pope , was soon submitted to by the English , who wanted leaders , and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest .
Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria -- '' ' ` Ugh ! '
said the Lory , with a shiver . '
I beg your pardon ! '
said the Mouse , frowning , but very politely : ` Did you speak ? '
` Not I ! '
said the Lory hastily . '
I thought you did , ' said the Mouse . '
-- I proceed .
`` Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria , declared for him : and even Stigand , the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury , found it advisable -- '' ' ` Found WHAT ? '
said the Duck .
` Found IT , ' the Mouse replied rather crossly : ` of course you know what `` it '' means . ' '
I know what `` it '' means well enough , when I find a thing , ' said the Duck : ` it 's generally a frog or a worm .
The question is , what did the archbishop find ? '
The Mouse did not notice this question , but hurriedly went on , ' '' -- found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown .
William 's conduct at first was moderate .
But the insolence of his Normans -- '' How are you getting on now , my dear ? '
it continued , turning to Alice as it spoke .
` As wet as ever , ' said Alice in a melancholy tone : ` it does n't seem to dry me at all . '
` In that case , ' said the Dodo solemnly , rising to its feet , ' I move that the meeting adjourn , for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies -- ' ` Speak English ! '
said the Eaglet . '
I do n't know the meaning of half those long words , and , what 's more , I do n't believe you do either ! '
And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile : some of the other birds tittered audibly .
` What I was going to say , ' said the Dodo in an offended tone , ` was , that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race . '
` What IS a Caucus-race ? '
said Alice ; not that she wanted much to know , but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak , and no one else seemed inclined to say anything .
` Why , ' said the Dodo , ` the best way to explain it is to do it . '
-LRB- And , as you might like to try the thing yourself , some winter day , I will tell you how the Dodo managed it . -RRB-
First it marked out a race-course , in a sort of circle , -LRB- ` the exact shape does n't matter , ' it said , -RRB- and then all the party were placed along the course , here and there .
There was no ` One , two , three , and away , ' but they began running when they liked , and left off when they liked , so that it was not easy to know when the race was over .
However , when they had been running half an hour or so , and were quite dry again , the Dodo suddenly called out ` The race is over ! '
and they all crowded round it , panting , and asking , ` But who has won ? '
This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought , and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead -LRB- the position in which you usually see Shakespeare , in the pictures of him -RRB- , while the rest waited in silence .
At last the Dodo said , ` EVERYBODY has won , and all must have prizes . '
` But who is to give the prizes ? '
quite a chorus of voices asked .
` Why , SHE , of course , ' said the Dodo , pointing to Alice with one finger ; and the whole party at once crowded round her , calling out in a confused way , ` Prizes !
Prizes ! '
Alice had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her hand in her pocket , and pulled out a box of comfits , -LRB- luckily the salt water had not got into it -RRB- , and handed them round as prizes .
There was exactly one a-piece all round .
` But she must have a prize herself , you know , ' said the Mouse .
` Of course , ' the Dodo replied very gravely .
` What else have you got in your pocket ? '
he went on , turning to Alice .
` Only a thimble , ' said Alice sadly .
` Hand it over here , ' said the Dodo .
Then they all crowded round her once more , while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble , saying ` We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble ' ; and , when it had finished this short speech , they all cheered .
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd , but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh ; and , as she could not think of anything to say , she simply bowed , and took the thimble , looking as solemn as she could .
The next thing was to eat the comfits : this caused some noise and confusion , as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs , and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back .
However , it was over at last , and they sat down again in a ring , and begged the Mouse to tell them something more .
` You promised to tell me your history , you know , ' said Alice , ` and why it is you hate -- C and D , ' she added in a whisper , half afraid that it would be offended again .
` Mine is a long and a sad tale ! '
said the Mouse , turning to Alice , and sighing .
` It IS a long tail , certainly , ' said Alice , looking down with wonder at the Mouse 's tail ; ` but why do you call it sad ? '
And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking , so that her idea of the tale was something like this : -- ` Fury said to a mouse , That he met in the house , `` Let us both go to law : I will prosecute YOU .
-- Come , I 'll take no denial ; We must have a trial : For really this morning I 've nothing to do . ''
Said the mouse to the cur , `` Such a trial , dear Sir , With no jury or judge , would be wasting our breath . ''
`` I 'll be judge , I 'll be jury , '' Said cunning old Fury : `` I 'll try the whole cause , and condemn you to death . '' '
` You are not attending ! '
said the Mouse to Alice severely .
` What are you thinking of ? ' '
I beg your pardon , ' said Alice very humbly : ` you had got to the fifth bend , I think ? ' '
I had NOT ! '
cried the Mouse , sharply and very angrily . '
A knot ! '
said Alice , always ready to make herself useful , and looking anxiously about her .
` Oh , do let me help to undo it ! ' '
I shall do nothing of the sort , ' said the Mouse , getting up and walking away .
` You insult me by talking such nonsense ! ' '
I did n't mean it ! '
pleaded poor Alice .
` But you 're so easily offended , you know ! '
The Mouse only growled in reply .
` Please come back and finish your story ! '
Alice called after it ; and the others all joined in chorus , ` Yes , please do ! '
but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently , and walked a little quicker .
` What a pity it would n't stay ! '
sighed the Lory , as soon as it was quite out of sight ; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ` Ah , my dear !
Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper ! '
` Hold your tongue , Ma ! '
said the young Crab , a little snappishly .
` You 're enough to try the patience of an oyster ! ' '
I wish I had our Dinah here , I know I do ! '
said Alice aloud , addressing nobody in particular .
` She 'd soon fetch it back ! '
` And who is Dinah , if I might venture to ask the question ? '
said the Lory .
Alice replied eagerly , for she was always ready to talk about her pet : ` Dinah 's our cat .
And she 's such a capital one for catching mice you ca n't think !
And oh , I wish you could see her after the birds !
Why , she 'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it ! '
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party .
Some of the birds hurried off at once : one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully , remarking , ' I really must be getting home ; the night-air does n't suit my throat ! '
and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children , ` Come away , my dears !
It 's high time you were all in bed ! '
On various pretexts they all moved off , and Alice was soon left alone . '
I wish I had n't mentioned Dinah ! '
she said to herself in a melancholy tone .
` Nobody seems to like her , down here , and I 'm sure she 's the best cat in the world !
Oh , my dear Dinah !
I wonder if I shall ever see you any more ! '
And here poor Alice began to cry again , for she felt very lonely and low-spirited .
In a little while , however , she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance , and she looked up eagerly , half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind , and was coming back to finish his story .
CHAPTER IV .
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit , trotting slowly back again , and looking anxiously about as it went , as if it had lost something ; and she heard it muttering to itself ` The Duchess !
The Duchess !
Oh my dear paws !
Oh my fur and whiskers !
She 'll get me executed , as sure as ferrets are ferrets !
Where CAN I have dropped them , I wonder ? '
Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves , and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them , but they were nowhere to be seen -- everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool , and the great hall , with the glass table and the little door , had vanished completely .
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice , as she went hunting about , and called out to her in an angry tone , ` Why , Mary Ann , what ARE you doing out here ?
Run home this moment , and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan !
Quick , now ! '
And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to , without trying to explain the mistake it had made .
` He took me for his housemaid , ' she said to herself as she ran .
` How surprised he 'll be when he finds out who I am !
But I 'd better take him his fan and gloves -- that is , if I can find them . '
As she said this , she came upon a neat little house , on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name ` W. RABBIT ' engraved upon it .
She went in without knocking , and hurried upstairs , in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann , and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves .
` How queer it seems , ' Alice said to herself , ` to be going messages for a rabbit !
I suppose Dinah 'll be sending me on messages next ! '
And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen : ' `` Miss Alice !
Come here directly , and get ready for your walk ! ''
`` Coming in a minute , nurse !
But I 've got to see that the mouse does n't get out . ''
Only I do n't think , ' Alice went on , ` that they 'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that ! '
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window , and on it -LRB- as she had hoped -RRB- a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves : she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves , and was just going to leave the room , when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass .
There was no label this time with the words ` DRINK ME , ' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips . '
I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen , ' she said to herself , ` whenever I eat or drink anything ; so I 'll just see what this bottle does .
I do hope it 'll make me grow large again , for really I 'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing ! '
It did so indeed , and much sooner than she had expected : before she had drunk half the bottle , she found her head pressing against the ceiling , and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken .
She hastily put down the bottle , saying to herself ` That 's quite enough -- I hope I sha n't grow any more -- As it is , I ca n't get out at the door -- I do wish I had n't drunk quite so much ! '
Alas !
it was too late to wish that !
She went on growing , and growing , and very soon had to kneel down on the floor : in another minute there was not even room for this , and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door , and the other arm curled round her head .
Still she went on growing , and , as a last resource , she put one arm out of the window , and one foot up the chimney , and said to herself ` Now I can do no more , whatever happens .
What WILL become of me ? '
Luckily for Alice , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect , and she grew no larger : still it was very uncomfortable , and , as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again , no wonder she felt unhappy .
` It was much pleasanter at home , ' thought poor Alice , ` when one was n't always growing larger and smaller , and being ordered about by mice and rabbits .
I almost wish I had n't gone down that rabbit-hole -- and yet -- and yet -- it 's rather curious , you know , this sort of life !
I do wonder what CAN have happened to me !
When I used to read fairy-tales , I fancied that kind of thing never happened , and now here I am in the middle of one !
There ought to be a book written about me , that there ought !
And when I grow up , I 'll write one -- but I 'm grown up now , ' she added in a sorrowful tone ; ` at least there 's no room to grow up any more HERE . '
` But then , ' thought Alice , ` shall I NEVER get any older than I am now ?
That 'll be a comfort , one way -- never to be an old woman -- but then -- always to have lessons to learn !
Oh , I should n't like THAT ! '
` Oh , you foolish Alice ! '
she answered herself .
` How can you learn lessons in here ?
Why , there 's hardly room for YOU , and no room at all for any lesson-books ! '
And so she went on , taking first one side and then the other , and making quite a conversation of it altogether ; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside , and stopped to listen .
` Mary Ann !
Mary Ann ! '
said the voice .
` Fetch me my gloves this moment ! '
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs .
Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her , and she trembled till she shook the house , quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit , and had no reason to be afraid of it .
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door , and tried to open it ; but , as the door opened inwards , and Alice 's elbow was pressed hard against it , that attempt proved a failure .
Alice heard it say to itself ` Then I 'll go round and get in at the window . '
` THAT you wo n't ' thought Alice , and , after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand , and made a snatch in the air .
She did not get hold of anything , but she heard a little shriek and a fall , and a crash of broken glass , from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame , or something of the sort .
Next came an angry voice -- the Rabbit 's -- ` Pat !
Pat !
Where are you ? '
And then a voice she had never heard before , ` Sure then I 'm here !
Digging for apples , yer honour ! '
` Digging for apples , indeed ! '
said the Rabbit angrily .
` Here !
Come and help me out of THIS ! '
-LRB- Sounds of more broken glass . -RRB-
` Now tell me , Pat , what 's that in the window ? '
` Sure , it 's an arm , yer honour ! '
-LRB- He pronounced it ` arrum . ' -RRB-
` An arm , you goose !
Who ever saw one that size ?
Why , it fills the whole window ! '
` Sure , it does , yer honour : but it 's an arm for all that . '
` Well , it 's got no business there , at any rate : go and take it away ! '
There was a long silence after this , and Alice could only hear whispers now and then ; such as , ` Sure , I do n't like it , yer honour , at all , at all ! '
` Do as I tell you , you coward ! '
and at last she spread out her hand again , and made another snatch in the air .
This time there were TWO little shrieks , and more sounds of broken glass .
` What a number of cucumber-frames there must be ! '
thought Alice . '
I wonder what they 'll do next !
As for pulling me out of the window , I only wish they COULD !
I 'm sure I do n't want to stay in here any longer ! '
She waited for some time without hearing anything more : at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels , and the sound of a good many voices all talking together : she made out the words : ` Where 's the other ladder ?
-- Why , I had n't to bring but one ; Bill 's got the other -- Bill !
fetch it here , lad !
-- Here , put 'em up at this corner -- No , tie 'em together first -- they do n't reach half high enough yet -- Oh !
they 'll do well enough ; do n't be particular -- Here , Bill !
catch hold of this rope -- Will the roof bear ?
-- Mind that loose slate -- Oh , it 's coming down !
Heads below ! '
-LRB- a loud crash -RRB- -- ` Now , who did that ?
-- It was Bill , I fancy -- Who 's to go down the chimney ?
-- Nay , I sha n't !
YOU do it !
-- That I wo n't , then !
-- Bill 's to go down -- Here , Bill !
the master says you 're to go down the chimney ! '
` Oh !
So Bill 's got to come down the chimney , has he ? '
said Alice to herself .
` Shy , they seem to put everything upon Bill !
I would n't be in Bill 's place for a good deal : this fireplace is narrow , to be sure ; but I THINK I can kick a little ! '
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could , and waited till she heard a little animal -LRB- she could n't guess of what sort it was -RRB- scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her : then , saying to herself ` This is Bill , ' she gave one sharp kick , and waited to see what would happen next .
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of ` There goes Bill ! '
then the Rabbit 's voice along -- ` Catch him , you by the hedge ! '
then silence , and then another confusion of voices -- ` Hold up his head -- Brandy now -- Do n't choke him -- How was it , old fellow ?
What happened to you ?
Tell us all about it ! '
Last came a little feeble , squeaking voice , -LRB- ` That 's Bill , ' thought Alice , -RRB- ` Well , I hardly know -- No more , thank ye ; I 'm better now -- but I 'm a deal too flustered to tell you -- all I know is , something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box , and up I goes like a sky-rocket ! '
` So you did , old fellow ! '
said the others .
` We must burn the house down ! '
said the Rabbit 's voice ; and Alice called out as loud as she could , ` If you do .
I 'll set Dinah at you ! '
There was a dead silence instantly , and Alice thought to herself , ' I wonder what they WILL do next !
If they had any sense , they 'd take the roof off . '
After a minute or two , they began moving about again , and Alice heard the Rabbit say , ' A barrowful will do , to begin with . ' '
A barrowful of WHAT ? '
thought Alice ; but she had not long to doubt , for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window , and some of them hit her in the face .
` I 'll put a stop to this , ' she said to herself , and shouted out , ` You 'd better not do that again ! '
which produced another dead silence .
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor , and a bright idea came into her head .
` If I eat one of these cakes , ' she thought , ` it 's sure to make SOME change in my size ; and as it ca n't possibly make me larger , it must make me smaller , I suppose . '
So she swallowed one of the cakes , and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly .
As soon as she was small enough to get through the door , she ran out of the house , and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside .
The poor little Lizard , Bill , was in the middle , being held up by two guinea-pigs , who were giving it something out of a bottle .
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared ; but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself safe in a thick wood .
` The first thing I 've got to do , ' said Alice to herself , as she wandered about in the wood , ` is to grow to my right size again ; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden .
I think that will be the best plan . '
It sounded an excellent plan , no doubt , and very neatly and simply arranged ; the only difficulty was , that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it ; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees , a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry .
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes , and feebly stretching out one paw , trying to touch her .
` Poor little thing ! '
said Alice , in a coaxing tone , and she tried hard to whistle to it ; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry , in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing .
Hardly knowing what she did , she picked up a little bit of stick , and held it out to the puppy ; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once , with a yelp of delight , and rushed at the stick , and made believe to worry it ; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle , to keep herself from being run over ; and the moment she appeared on the other side , the puppy made another rush at the stick , and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it ; then Alice , thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse , and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet , ran round the thistle again ; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick , running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back , and barking hoarsely all the while , till at last it sat down a good way off , panting , with its tongue hanging out of its mouth , and its great eyes half shut .
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape ; so she set off at once , and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath , and till the puppy 's bark sounded quite faint in the distance .
` And yet what a dear little puppy it was ! '
said Alice , as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself , and fanned herself with one of the leaves : ' I should have liked teaching it tricks very much , if -- if I 'd only been the right size to do it !
Oh dear !
I 'd nearly forgotten that I 've got to grow up again !
Let me see -- how IS it to be managed ?
I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great question is , what ? '
The great question certainly was , what ?
Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass , but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances .
There was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself ; and when she had looked under it , and on both sides of it , and behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it .
She stretched herself up on tiptoe , and peeped over the edge of the mushroom , and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar , that was sitting on the top with its arms folded , quietly smoking a long hookah , and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else .
CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence : at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth , and addressed her in a languid , sleepy voice .
` Who are YOU ? '
said the Caterpillar .
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation .
Alice replied , rather shyly , ` I -- I hardly know , sir , just at present -- at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning , but I think I must have been changed several times since then . '
` What do you mean by that ? '
said the Caterpillar sternly .
` Explain yourself ! ' '
I ca n't explain MYSELF , I 'm afraid , sir ' said Alice , ` because I 'm not myself , you see . ' '
I do n't see , ' said the Caterpillar .
` I 'm afraid I ca n't put it more clearly , ' Alice replied very politely , ` for I ca n't understand it myself to begin with ; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing . '
` It is n't , ' said the Caterpillar .
` Well , perhaps you have n't found it so yet , ' said Alice ; ` but when you have to turn into a chrysalis -- you will some day , you know -- and then after that into a butterfly , I should think you 'll feel it a little queer , wo n't you ? '
` Not a bit , ' said the Caterpillar .
` Well , perhaps your feelings may be different , ' said Alice ; ` all I know is , it would feel very queer to ME . '
` You ! '
said the Caterpillar contemptuously .
` Who are YOU ? '
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation .
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar 's making such VERY short remarks , and she drew herself up and said , very gravely , ' I think , you ought to tell me who YOU are , first . '
` Why ? '
said the Caterpillar .
Here was another puzzling question ; and as Alice could not think of any good reason , and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind , she turned away .
` Come back ! '
the Caterpillar called after her .
` I 've something important to say ! '
This sounded promising , certainly : Alice turned and came back again .
` Keep your temper , ' said the Caterpillar .
` Is that all ? '
said Alice , swallowing down her anger as well as she could .
` No , ' said the Caterpillar .
Alice thought she might as well wait , as she had nothing else to do , and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing .
For some minutes it puffed away without speaking , but at last it unfolded its arms , took the hookah out of its mouth again , and said , ` So you think you 're changed , do you ? '
` I 'm afraid I am , sir , ' said Alice ; ' I ca n't remember things as I used -- and I do n't keep the same size for ten minutes together ! '
` Ca n't remember WHAT things ? '
said the Caterpillar .
` Well , I 've tried to say `` HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE , '' but it all came different ! '
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice .
` Repeat , `` YOU ARE OLD , FATHER WILLIAM , '' ' said the Caterpillar .
Alice folded her hands , and began : -- ` You are old , Father William , ' the young man said , ` And your hair has become very white ; And yet you incessantly stand on your head -- Do you think , at your age , it is right ? '
` In my youth , ' Father William replied to his son , ' I feared it might injure the brain ; But , now that I 'm perfectly sure I have none , Why , I do it again and again . '
` You are old , ' said the youth , ` as I mentioned before , And have grown most uncommonly fat ; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door -- Pray , what is the reason of that ? '
` In my youth , ' said the sage , as he shook his grey locks , ' I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment -- one shilling the box -- Allow me to sell you a couple ? '
` You are old , ' said the youth , ` and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet ; Yet you finished the goose , with the bones and the beak -- Pray how did you manage to do it ? '
` In my youth , ' said his father , ' I took to the law , And argued each case with my wife ; And the muscular strength , which it gave to my jaw , Has lasted the rest of my life . '
` You are old , ' said the youth , ` one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever ; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose -- What made you so awfully clever ? ' '
I have answered three questions , and that is enough , ' Said his father ; ` do n't give yourself airs !
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff ?
Be off , or I 'll kick you down stairs ! '
` That is not said right , ' said the Caterpillar .
` Not QUITE right , I 'm afraid , ' said Alice , timidly ; ` some of the words have got altered . '
` It is wrong from beginning to end , ' said the Caterpillar decidedly , and there was silence for some minutes .
The Caterpillar was the first to speak .
` What size do you want to be ? '
it asked .
` Oh , I 'm not particular as to size , ' Alice hastily replied ; ` only one does n't like changing so often , you know . ' '
I DO N'T know , ' said the Caterpillar .
Alice said nothing : she had never been so much contradicted in her life before , and she felt that she was losing her temper .
` Are you content now ? '
said the Caterpillar .
` Well , I should like to be a LITTLE larger , sir , if you would n't mind , ' said Alice : ` three inches is such a wretched height to be . '
` It is a very good height indeed ! '
said the Caterpillar angrily , rearing itself upright as it spoke -LRB- it was exactly three inches high -RRB- .
` But I 'm not used to it ! '
pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone .
And she thought of herself , ' I wish the creatures would n't be so easily offended ! '
` You 'll get used to it in time , ' said the Caterpillar ; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again .
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again .
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice , and shook itself .
Then it got down off the mushroom , and crawled away in the grass , merely remarking as it went , ` One side will make you grow taller , and the other side will make you grow shorter . '
` One side of WHAT ?
The other side of WHAT ? '
thought Alice to herself .
` Of the mushroom , ' said the Caterpillar , just as if she had asked it aloud ; and in another moment it was out of sight .
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute , trying to make out which were the two sides of it ; and as it was perfectly round , she found this a very difficult question .
However , at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go , and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand .
` And now which is which ? '
she said to herself , and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect : the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin : it had struck her foot !
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change , but she felt that there was no time to be lost , as she was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit .
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot , that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last , and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ` Come , my head 's free at last ! '
said Alice in a tone of delight , which changed into alarm in another moment , when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found : all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her .
` What CAN all that green stuff be ? '
said Alice .
` And where HAVE my shoulders got to ?
And oh , my poor hands , how is it I ca n't see you ? '
She was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves .
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head , she tried to get her head down to them , and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction , like a serpent .
She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag , and was going to dive in among the leaves , which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry : a large pigeon had flown into her face , and was beating her violently with its wings .
` Serpent ! '
screamed the Pigeon .
` I 'm NOT a serpent ! '
said Alice indignantly .
` Let me alone ! '
` Serpent , I say again ! '
repeated the Pigeon , but in a more subdued tone , and added with a kind of sob , ` I 've tried every way , and nothing seems to suit them ! ' '
I have n't the least idea what you 're talking about , ' said Alice .
` I 've tried the roots of trees , and I 've tried banks , and I 've tried hedges , ' the Pigeon went on , without attending to her ; ` but those serpents !
There 's no pleasing them ! '
Alice was more and more puzzled , but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished .
` As if it was n't trouble enough hatching the eggs , ' said the Pigeon ; ` but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day !
Why , I have n't had a wink of sleep these three weeks ! '
` I 'm very sorry you 've been annoyed , ' said Alice , who was beginning to see its meaning .
` And just as I 'd taken the highest tree in the wood , ' continued the Pigeon , raising its voice to a shriek , ` and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last , they must needs come wriggling down from the sky !
Ugh , Serpent ! '
` But I 'm NOT a serpent , I tell you ! '
said Alice .
` I 'm a -- I 'm a -- ' ` Well !
WHAT are you ? '
said the Pigeon . '
I can see you 're trying to invent something ! '
` I -- I 'm a little girl , ' said Alice , rather doubtfully , as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day . '
A likely story indeed ! '
said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt .
` I 've seen a good many little girls in my time , but never ONE with such a neck as that !
No , no !
You 're a serpent ; and there 's no use denying it .
I suppose you 'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg ! ' '
I HAVE tasted eggs , certainly , ' said Alice , who was a very truthful child ; ` but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do , you know . ' '
I do n't believe it , ' said the Pigeon ; ` but if they do , why then they 're a kind of serpent , that 's all I can say . '
This was such a new idea to Alice , that she was quite silent for a minute or two , which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding , ` You 're looking for eggs , I know THAT well enough ; and what does it matter to me whether you 're a little girl or a serpent ? '
` It matters a good deal to ME , ' said Alice hastily ; ` but I 'm not looking for eggs , as it happens ; and if I was , I should n't want YOURS : I do n't like them raw . '
` Well , be off , then ! '
said the Pigeon in a sulky tone , as it settled down again into its nest .
Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could , for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches , and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it .
After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands , and she set to work very carefully , nibbling first at one and then at the other , and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height .
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size , that it felt quite strange at first ; but she got used to it in a few minutes , and began talking to herself , as usual .
` Come , there 's half my plan done now !
How puzzling all these changes are !
I 'm never sure what I 'm going to be , from one minute to another !
However , I 've got back to my right size : the next thing is , to get into that beautiful garden -- how IS that to be done , I wonder ? '
As she said this , she came suddenly upon an open place , with a little house in it about four feet high .
` Whoever lives there , ' thought Alice , ` it 'll never do to come upon them THIS size : why , I should frighten them out of their wits ! '
So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again , and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high .
CHAPTER VI .
Pig and Pepper For a minute or two she stood looking at the house , and wondering what to do next , when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood -- -LRB- she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery : otherwise , judging by his face only , she would have called him a fish -RRB- -- and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles .
It was opened by another footman in livery , with a round face , and large eyes like a frog ; and both footmen , Alice noticed , had powdered hair that curled all over their heads .
She felt very curious to know what it was all about , and crept a little way out of the wood to listen .
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter , nearly as large as himself , and this he handed over to the other , saying , in a solemn tone , ` For the Duchess .
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet . '
The Frog-Footman repeated , in the same solemn tone , only changing the order of the words a little , ` From the Queen .
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet . '
Then they both bowed low , and their curls got entangled together .
Alice laughed so much at this , that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her ; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone , and the other was sitting on the ground near the door , staring stupidly up into the sky .
Alice went timidly up to the door , and knocked .
` There 's no sort of use in knocking , ' said the Footman , ` and that for two reasons .
First , because I 'm on the same side of the door as you are ; secondly , because they 're making such a noise inside , no one could possibly hear you . '
And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within -- a constant howling and sneezing , and every now and then a great crash , as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces .
` Please , then , ' said Alice , ` how am I to get in ? '
` There might be some sense in your knocking , ' the Footman went on without attending to her , ` if we had the door between us .
For instance , if you were INSIDE , you might knock , and I could let you out , you know . '
He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking , and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil .
` But perhaps he ca n't help it , ' she said to herself ; ` his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head .
But at any rate he might answer questions .
-- How am I to get in ? '
she repeated , aloud . '
I shall sit here , ' the Footman remarked , 'till tomorrow -- ' At this moment the door of the house opened , and a large plate came skimming out , straight at the Footman 's head : it just grazed his nose , and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him . '
-- or next day , maybe , ' the Footman continued in the same tone , exactly as if nothing had happened .
` How am I to get in ? '
asked Alice again , in a louder tone .
` ARE you to get in at all ? '
said the Footman .
` That 's the first question , you know . '
It was , no doubt : only Alice did not like to be told so .
` It 's really dreadful , ' she muttered to herself , ` the way all the creatures argue .
It 's enough to drive one crazy ! '
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark , with variations . '
I shall sit here , ' he said , ` on and off , for days and days . '
` But what am I to do ? '
said Alice .
` Anything you like , ' said the Footman , and began whistling .
` Oh , there 's no use in talking to him , ' said Alice desperately : ` he 's perfectly idiotic ! '
And she opened the door and went in .
The door led right into a large kitchen , which was full of smoke from one end to the other : the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle , nursing a baby ; the cook was leaning over the fire , stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup .
` There 's certainly too much pepper in that soup ! '
Alice said to herself , as well as she could for sneezing .
There was certainly too much of it in the air .
Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally ; and as for the baby , it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment 's pause .
The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze , were the cook , and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear .
` Please would you tell me , ' said Alice , a little timidly , for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first , ` why your cat grins like that ? '
` It 's a Cheshire cat , ' said the Duchess , ` and that 's why .
Pig ! '
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped ; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby , and not to her , so she took courage , and went on again : -- ' I did n't know that Cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact , I did n't know that cats COULD grin . '
` They all can , ' said the Duchess ; ` and most of 'em do . ' '
I do n't know of any that do , ' Alice said very politely , feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation .
` You do n't know much , ' said the Duchess ; ` and that 's a fact . '
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark , and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation .
While she was trying to fix on one , the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire , and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby -- the fire-irons came first ; then followed a shower of saucepans , plates , and dishes .
The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her ; and the baby was howling so much already , that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not .
` Oh , PLEASE mind what you 're doing ! '
cried Alice , jumping up and down in an agony of terror .
` Oh , there goes his PRECIOUS nose ' ; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it , and very nearly carried it off .
` If everybody minded their own business , ' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl , ` the world would go round a deal faster than it does . '
` Which would NOT be an advantage , ' said Alice , who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge .
` Just think of what work it would make with the day and night !
You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis -- ' ` Talking of axes , ' said the Duchess , ` chop off her head ! '
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook , to see if she meant to take the hint ; but the cook was busily stirring the soup , and seemed not to be listening , so she went on again : ` Twenty-four hours , I THINK ; or is it twelve ?
I -- ' ` Oh , do n't bother ME , ' said the Duchess ; ' I never could abide figures ! '
And with that she began nursing her child again , singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so , and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line : ` Speak roughly to your little boy , And beat him when he sneezes : He only does it to annoy , Because he knows it teases . '
CHORUS .
-LRB- In which the cook and the baby joined -RRB- : -- ` Wow !
wow !
wow ! '
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song , she kept tossing the baby violently up and down , and the poor little thing howled so , that Alice could hardly hear the words : -- ' I speak severely to my boy , I beat him when he sneezes ; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases ! '
CHORUS .
` Wow !
wow !
wow ! '
` Here !
you may nurse it a bit , if you like ! '
the Duchess said to Alice , flinging the baby at her as she spoke . '
I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen , ' and she hurried out of the room .
The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out , but it just missed her .
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty , as it was a queer-shaped little creature , and held out its arms and legs in all directions , ` just like a star-fish , ' thought Alice .
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it , and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it .
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it , -LRB- which was to twist it up into a sort of knot , and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot , so as to prevent its undoing itself , -RRB- she carried it out into the open air .
` IF I do n't take this child away with me , ' thought Alice , ` they 're sure to kill it in a day or two : would n't it be murder to leave it behind ? '
She said the last words out loud , and the little thing grunted in reply -LRB- it had left off sneezing by this time -RRB- .
` Do n't grunt , ' said Alice ; ` that 's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself . '
The baby grunted again , and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it .
There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose , much more like a snout than a real nose ; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby : altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all .
` But perhaps it was only sobbing , ' she thought , and looked into its eyes again , to see if there were any tears .
No , there were no tears .
` If you 're going to turn into a pig , my dear , ' said Alice , seriously , ` I 'll have nothing more to do with you .
Mind now ! '
The poor little thing sobbed again -LRB- or grunted , it was impossible to say which -RRB- , and they went on for some while in silence .
Alice was just beginning to think to herself , ` Now , what am I to do with this creature when I get it home ? '
when it grunted again , so violently , that she looked down into its face in some alarm .
This time there could be NO mistake about it : it was neither more nor less than a pig , and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further .
So she set the little creature down , and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood .
` If it had grown up , ' she said to herself , ` it would have made a dreadfully ugly child : but it makes rather a handsome pig , I think . '
And she began thinking over other children she knew , who might do very well as pigs , and was just saying to herself , ` if one only knew the right way to change them -- ' when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off .
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice .
It looked good-natured , she thought : still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth , so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect .
` Cheshire Puss , ' she began , rather timidly , as she did not at all know whether it would like the name : however , it only grinned a little wider .
` Come , it 's pleased so far , ' thought Alice , and she went on .
` Would you tell me , please , which way I ought to go from here ? '
` That depends a good deal on where you want to get to , ' said the Cat . '
I do n't much care where -- ' said Alice .
` Then it does n't matter which way you go , ' said the Cat . '
-- so long as I get SOMEWHERE , ' Alice added as an explanation .
` Oh , you 're sure to do that , ' said the Cat , ` if you only walk long enough . '
Alice felt that this could not be denied , so she tried another question .
` What sort of people live about here ? '
` In THAT direction , ' the Cat said , waving its right paw round , ` lives a Hatter : and in THAT direction , ' waving the other paw , ` lives a March Hare .
Visit either you like : they 're both mad . '
` But I do n't want to go among mad people , ' Alice remarked .
` Oh , you ca n't help that , ' said the Cat : ` we 're all mad here .
I 'm mad .
You 're mad . '
` How do you know I 'm mad ? '
said Alice .
` You must be , ' said the Cat , ` or you would n't have come here . '
Alice did n't think that proved it at all ; however , she went on ` And how do you know that you 're mad ? '
` To begin with , ' said the Cat , ' a dog 's not mad .
You grant that ? ' '
I suppose so , ' said Alice .
` Well , then , ' the Cat went on , ` you see , a dog growls when it 's angry , and wags its tail when it 's pleased .
Now I growl when I 'm pleased , and wag my tail when I 'm angry .
Therefore I 'm mad . ' '
I call it purring , not growling , ' said Alice .
` Call it what you like , ' said the Cat .
` Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day ? ' '
I should like it very much , ' said Alice , ` but I have n't been invited yet . '
` You 'll see me there , ' said the Cat , and vanished .
Alice was not much surprised at this , she was getting so used to queer things happening .
While she was looking at the place where it had been , it suddenly appeared again .
` By-the-bye , what became of the baby ? '
said the Cat .
` I 'd nearly forgotten to ask . '
` It turned into a pig , ' Alice quietly said , just as if it had come back in a natural way . '
I thought it would , ' said the Cat , and vanished again .
Alice waited a little , half expecting to see it again , but it did not appear , and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live .
` I 've seen hatters before , ' she said to herself ; ` the March Hare will be much the most interesting , and perhaps as this is May it wo n't be raving mad -- at least not so mad as it was in March . '
As she said this , she looked up , and there was the Cat again , sitting on a branch of a tree .
` Did you say pig , or fig ? '
said the Cat . '
I said pig , ' replied Alice ; ` and I wish you would n't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly : you make one quite giddy . '
` All right , ' said the Cat ; and this time it vanished quite slowly , beginning with the end of the tail , and ending with the grin , which remained some time after the rest of it had gone .
` Well !
I 've often seen a cat without a grin , ' thought Alice ; ` but a grin without a cat !
It 's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life ! '
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare : she thought it must be the right house , because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur .
It was so large a house , that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom , and raised herself to about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly , saying to herself ` Suppose it should be raving mad after all !
I almost wish I 'd gone to see the Hatter instead ! '
CHAPTER VII .
A Mad Tea-Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house , and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it : a Dormouse was sitting between them , fast asleep , and the other two were using it as a cushion , resting their elbows on it , and talking over its head .
` Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse , ' thought Alice ; ` only , as it 's asleep , I suppose it does n't mind . '
The table was a large one , but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it : ` No room !
No room ! '
they cried out when they saw Alice coming .
` There 's PLENTY of room ! '
said Alice indignantly , and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table .
` Have some wine , ' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone .
Alice looked all round the table , but there was nothing on it but tea . '
I do n't see any wine , ' she remarked .
` There is n't any , ' said the March Hare .
` Then it was n't very civil of you to offer it , ' said Alice angrily .
` It was n't very civil of you to sit down without being invited , ' said the March Hare . '
I did n't know it was YOUR table , ' said Alice ; ` it 's laid for a great many more than three . '
` Your hair wants cutting , ' said the Hatter .
He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity , and this was his first speech .
` You should learn not to make personal remarks , ' Alice said with some severity ; ` it 's very rude . '
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this ; but all he SAID was , ` Why is a raven like a writing-desk ? '
` Come , we shall have some fun now ! '
thought Alice .
` I 'm glad they 've begun asking riddles .
-- I believe I can guess that , ' she added aloud .
` Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it ? '
said the March Hare .
` Exactly so , ' said Alice .
` Then you should say what you mean , ' the March Hare went on . '
I do , ' Alice hastily replied ; ` at least -- at least I mean what I say -- that 's the same thing , you know . '
` Not the same thing a bit ! '
said the Hatter .
` You might just as well say that `` I see what I eat '' is the same thing as `` I eat what I see '' ! '
` You might just as well say , ' added the March Hare , ` that `` I like what I get '' is the same thing as `` I get what I like '' ! '
` You might just as well say , ' added the Dormouse , who seemed to be talking in his sleep , ` that `` I breathe when I sleep '' is the same thing as `` I sleep when I breathe '' ! '
` It IS the same thing with you , ' said the Hatter , and here the conversation dropped , and the party sat silent for a minute , while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks , which was n't much .
The Hatter was the first to break the silence .
` What day of the month is it ? '
he said , turning to Alice : he had taken his watch out of his pocket , and was looking at it uneasily , shaking it every now and then , and holding it to his ear .
Alice considered a little , and then said ` The fourth . '
` Two days wrong ! '
sighed the Hatter . '
I told you butter would n't suit the works ! '
he added looking angrily at the March Hare .
` It was the BEST butter , ' the March Hare meekly replied .
` Yes , but some crumbs must have got in as well , ' the Hatter grumbled : ` you should n't have put it in with the bread-knife . '
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily : then he dipped it into his cup of tea , and looked at it again : but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark , ` It was the BEST butter , you know . '
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity .
` What a funny watch ! '
she remarked .
` It tells the day of the month , and does n't tell what o'clock it is ! '
` Why should it ? '
muttered the Hatter .
` Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is ? '
` Of course not , ' Alice replied very readily : ` but that 's because it stays the same year for such a long time together . '
` Which is just the case with MINE , ' said the Hatter .
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled .
The Hatter 's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it , and yet it was certainly English . '
I do n't quite understand you , ' she said , as politely as she could .
` The Dormouse is asleep again , ' said the Hatter , and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose .
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently , and said , without opening its eyes , ` Of course , of course ; just what I was going to remark myself . '
` Have you guessed the riddle yet ? '
the Hatter said , turning to Alice again .
` No , I give it up , ' Alice replied : ` what 's the answer ? ' '
I have n't the slightest idea , ' said the Hatter .
` Nor I , ' said the March Hare .
Alice sighed wearily . '
I think you might do something better with the time , ' she said , ` than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers . '
` If you knew Time as well as I do , ' said the Hatter , ` you would n't talk about wasting IT .
It 's HIM . ' '
I do n't know what you mean , ' said Alice .
` Of course you do n't ! '
the Hatter said , tossing his head contemptuously . '
I dare say you never even spoke to Time ! '
` Perhaps not , ' Alice cautiously replied : ` but I know I have to beat time when I learn music . '
` Ah !
that accounts for it , ' said the Hatter .
` He wo n't stand beating .
Now , if you only kept on good terms with him , he 'd do almost anything you liked with the clock .
For instance , suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning , just time to begin lessons : you 'd only have to whisper a hint to Time , and round goes the clock in a twinkling !
Half-past one , time for dinner ! '
-LRB- ' I only wish it was , ' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper . -RRB-
` That would be grand , certainly , ' said Alice thoughtfully : ` but then -- I should n't be hungry for it , you know . '
` Not at first , perhaps , ' said the Hatter : ` but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked . '
` Is that the way YOU manage ? '
Alice asked .
The Hatter shook his head mournfully .
` Not I ! '
he replied .
` We quarrelled last March -- just before HE went mad , you know -- ' -LRB- pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare , -RRB- ' -- it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts , and I had to sing `` Twinkle , twinkle , little bat !
How I wonder what you 're at ! ''
You know the song , perhaps ? '
` I 've heard something like it , ' said Alice .
` It goes on , you know , ' the Hatter continued , ` in this way : -- `` Up above the world you fly , Like a tea-tray in the sky .
Twinkle , twinkle -- '' ' Here the Dormouse shook itself , and began singing in its sleep ` Twinkle , twinkle , twinkle , twinkle -- ' and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop .
` Well , I 'd hardly finished the first verse , ' said the Hatter , ` when the Queen jumped up and bawled out , `` He 's murdering the time !
Off with his head ! '' '
` How dreadfully savage ! '
exclaimed Alice .
` And ever since that , ' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone , ` he wo n't do a thing I ask !
It 's always six o'clock now . '
A bright idea came into Alice 's head .
` Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here ? '
she asked .
` Yes , that 's it , ' said the Hatter with a sigh : ` it 's always tea-time , and we 've no time to wash the things between whiles . '
` Then you keep moving round , I suppose ? '
said Alice .
` Exactly so , ' said the Hatter : ` as the things get used up . '
` But what happens when you come to the beginning again ? '
Alice ventured to ask .
` Suppose we change the subject , ' the March Hare interrupted , yawning .
` I 'm getting tired of this .
I vote the young lady tells us a story . '
` I 'm afraid I do n't know one , ' said Alice , rather alarmed at the proposal .
` Then the Dormouse shall ! '
they both cried .
` Wake up , Dormouse ! '
And they pinched it on both sides at once .
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes . '
I was n't asleep , ' he said in a hoarse , feeble voice : ' I heard every word you fellows were saying . '
` Tell us a story ! '
said the March Hare .
` Yes , please do ! '
pleaded Alice .
` And be quick about it , ' added the Hatter , ` or you 'll be asleep again before it 's done . '
` Once upon a time there were three little sisters , ' the Dormouse began in a great hurry ; ` and their names were Elsie , Lacie , and Tillie ; and they lived at the bottom of a well -- ' ` What did they live on ? '
said Alice , who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking .
` They lived on treacle , ' said the Dormouse , after thinking a minute or two .
` They could n't have done that , you know , ' Alice gently remarked ; ` they 'd have been ill . '
` So they were , ' said the Dormouse ; ` VERY ill . '
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like , but it puzzled her too much , so she went on : ` But why did they live at the bottom of a well ? '
` Take some more tea , ' the March Hare said to Alice , very earnestly .
` I 've had nothing yet , ' Alice replied in an offended tone , ` so I ca n't take more . '
` You mean you ca n't take LESS , ' said the Hatter : ` it 's very easy to take MORE than nothing . '
` Nobody asked YOUR opinion , ' said Alice .
` Who 's making personal remarks now ? '
the Hatter asked triumphantly .
Alice did not quite know what to say to this : so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter , and then turned to the Dormouse , and repeated her question .
` Why did they live at the bottom of a well ? '
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it , and then said , ` It was a treacle-well . '
` There 's no such thing ! '
Alice was beginning very angrily , but the Hatter and the March Hare went ` Sh !
sh ! '
and the Dormouse sulkily remarked , ` If you ca n't be civil , you 'd better finish the story for yourself . '
` No , please go on ! '
Alice said very humbly ; ' I wo n't interrupt again .
I dare say there may be ONE . '
` One , indeed ! '
said the Dormouse indignantly .
However , he consented to go on .
` And so these three little sisters -- they were learning to draw , you know -- ' ` What did they draw ? '
said Alice , quite forgetting her promise .
` Treacle , ' said the Dormouse , without considering at all this time . '
I want a clean cup , ' interrupted the Hatter : ` let 's all move one place on . '
He moved on as he spoke , and the Dormouse followed him : the March Hare moved into the Dormouse 's place , and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare .
The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change : and Alice was a good deal worse off than before , as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate .
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again , so she began very cautiously : ` But I do n't understand .
Where did they draw the treacle from ? '
` You can draw water out of a water-well , ' said the Hatter ; ` so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well -- eh , stupid ? '
` But they were IN the well , ' Alice said to the Dormouse , not choosing to notice this last remark .
` Of course they were ' , said the Dormouse ; ' -- well in . '
This answer so confused poor Alice , that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it .
` They were learning to draw , ' the Dormouse went on , yawning and rubbing its eyes , for it was getting very sleepy ; ` and they drew all manner of things -- everything that begins with an M -- ' ` Why with an M ? '
said Alice .
` Why not ? '
said the March Hare .
Alice was silent .
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time , and was going off into a doze ; but , on being pinched by the Hatter , it woke up again with a little shriek , and went on : ' -- that begins with an M , such as mouse-traps , and the moon , and memory , and muchness -- you know you say things are `` much of a muchness '' -- did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness ? '
` Really , now you ask me , ' said Alice , very much confused , ' I do n't think -- ' ` Then you should n't talk , ' said the Hatter .
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear : she got up in great disgust , and walked off ; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly , and neither of the others took the least notice of her going , though she looked back once or twice , half hoping that they would call after her : the last time she saw them , they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot .
` At any rate I 'll never go THERE again ! '
said Alice as she picked her way through the wood .
` It 's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life ! '
Just as she said this , she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it .
` That 's very curious ! '
she thought .
` But everything 's curious today .
I think I may as well go in at once . '
And in she went .
Once more she found herself in the long hall , and close to the little glass table .
` Now , I 'll manage better this time , ' she said to herself , and began by taking the little golden key , and unlocking the door that led into the garden .
Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom -LRB- she had kept a piece of it in her pocket -RRB- till she was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and THEN -- she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains .
CHAPTER VIII .
The Queen 's Croquet-Ground A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden : the roses growing on it were white , but there were three gardeners at it , busily painting them red .
Alice thought this a very curious thing , and she went nearer to watch them , and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say , ` Look out now , Five !
Do n't go splashing paint over me like that ! ' '
I could n't help it , ' said Five , in a sulky tone ; ` Seven jogged my elbow . '
On which Seven looked up and said , ` That 's right , Five !
Always lay the blame on others ! '
` YOU 'D better not talk ! '
said Five . '
I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded ! '
` What for ? '
said the one who had spoken first .
` That 's none of YOUR business , Two ! '
said Seven .
` Yes , it IS his business ! '
said Five , ` and I 'll tell him -- it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions . '
Seven flung down his brush , and had just begun ` Well , of all the unjust things -- ' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice , as she stood watching them , and he checked himself suddenly : the others looked round also , and all of them bowed low .
` Would you tell me , ' said Alice , a little timidly , ` why you are painting those roses ? '
Five and Seven said nothing , but looked at Two .
Two began in a low voice , ` Why the fact is , you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the Queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know .
So you see , Miss , we 're doing our best , afore she comes , to -- ' At this moment Five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out ` The Queen !
The Queen ! '
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces .
There was a sound of many footsteps , and Alice looked round , eager to see the Queen .
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs ; these were all shaped like the three gardeners , oblong and flat , with their hands and feet at the corners : next the ten courtiers ; these were ornamented all over with diamonds , and walked two and two , as the soldiers did .
After these came the royal children ; there were ten of them , and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand , in couples : they were all ornamented with hearts .
Next came the guests , mostly Kings and Queens , and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit : it was talking in a hurried nervous manner , smiling at everything that was said , and went by without noticing her .
Then followed the Knave of Hearts , carrying the King 's crown on a crimson velvet cushion ; and , last of all this grand procession , came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS .
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners , but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions ; ` and besides , what would be the use of a procession , ' thought she , ` if people had all to lie down upon their faces , so that they could n't see it ? '
So she stood still where she was , and waited .
When the procession came opposite to Alice , they all stopped and looked at her , and the Queen said severely ` Who is this ? '
She said it to the Knave of Hearts , who only bowed and smiled in reply .
` Idiot ! '
said the Queen , tossing her head impatiently ; and , turning to Alice , she went on , ` What 's your name , child ? '
` My name is Alice , so please your Majesty , ' said Alice very politely ; but she added , to herself , ` Why , they 're only a pack of cards , after all .
I need n't be afraid of them ! '
` And who are THESE ? '
said the Queen , pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree ; for , you see , as they were lying on their faces , and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack , she could not tell whether they were gardeners , or soldiers , or courtiers , or three of her own children .
` How should I know ? '
said Alice , surprised at her own courage .
` It 's no business of MINE . '
The Queen turned crimson with fury , and , after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast , screamed ` Off with her head !
Off -- ' ` Nonsense ! '
said Alice , very loudly and decidedly , and the Queen was silent .
The King laid his hand upon her arm , and timidly said ` Consider , my dear : she is only a child ! '
The Queen turned angrily away from him , and said to the Knave ` Turn them over ! '
The Knave did so , very carefully , with one foot .
` Get up ! '
said the Queen , in a shrill , loud voice , and the three gardeners instantly jumped up , and began bowing to the King , the Queen , the royal children , and everybody else .
` Leave off that ! '
screamed the Queen .
` You make me giddy . '
And then , turning to the rose-tree , she went on , ` What HAVE you been doing here ? '
` May it please your Majesty , ' said Two , in a very humble tone , going down on one knee as he spoke , ` we were trying -- ' ' I see ! '
said the Queen , who had meanwhile been examining the roses .
` Off with their heads ! '
and the procession moved on , three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners , who ran to Alice for protection .
` You sha n't be beheaded ! '
said Alice , and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near .
The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two , looking for them , and then quietly marched off after the others .
` Are their heads off ? '
shouted the Queen .
` Their heads are gone , if it please your Majesty ! '
the soldiers shouted in reply .
` That 's right ! '
shouted the Queen .
` Can you play croquet ? '
The soldiers were silent , and looked at Alice , as the question was evidently meant for her .
` Yes ! '
shouted Alice .
` Come on , then ! '
roared the Queen , and Alice joined the procession , wondering very much what would happen next .
` It 's -- it 's a very fine day ! '
said a timid voice at her side .
She was walking by the White Rabbit , who was peeping anxiously into her face .
` Very , ' said Alice : ' -- where 's the Duchess ? '
` Hush !
Hush ! '
said the Rabbit in a low , hurried tone .
He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke , and then raised himself upon tiptoe , put his mouth close to her ear , and whispered ` She 's under sentence of execution . '
` What for ? '
said Alice .
` Did you say `` What a pity ! ''
? '
the Rabbit asked .
` No , I did n't , ' said Alice : ' I do n't think it 's at all a pity .
I said `` What for ? '' '
` She boxed the Queen 's ears -- ' the Rabbit began .
Alice gave a little scream of laughter .
` Oh , hush ! '
the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone .
` The Queen will hear you !
You see , she came rather late , and the Queen said -- ' ` Get to your places ! '
shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder , and people began running about in all directions , tumbling up against each other ; however , they got settled down in a minute or two , and the game began .
Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life ; it was all ridges and furrows ; the balls were live hedgehogs , the mallets live flamingoes , and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet , to make the arches .
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm , with its legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out , and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and , as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed .
The players all played at once without waiting for turns , quarrelling all the while , and fighting for the hedgehogs ; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion , and went stamping about , and shouting ` Off with his head ! '
or ` Off with her head ! '
about once in a minute .
Alice began to feel very uneasy : to be sure , she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen , but she knew that it might happen any minute , ` and then , ' thought she , ` what would become of me ?
They 're dreadfully fond of beheading people here ; the great wonder is , that there 's any one left alive ! '
She was looking about for some way of escape , and wondering whether she could get away without being seen , when she noticed a curious appearance in the air : it puzzled her very much at first , but , after watching it a minute or two , she made it out to be a grin , and she said to herself ` It 's the Cheshire Cat : now I shall have somebody to talk to . '
` How are you getting on ? '
said the Cat , as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with .
Alice waited till the eyes appeared , and then nodded .
` It 's no use speaking to it , ' she thought , 'till its ears have come , or at least one of them . '
In another minute the whole head appeared , and then Alice put down her flamingo , and began an account of the game , feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her .
The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight , and no more of it appeared . '
I do n't think they play at all fairly , ' Alice began , in rather a complaining tone , ` and they all quarrel so dreadfully one ca n't hear oneself speak -- and they do n't seem to have any rules in particular ; at least , if there are , nobody attends to them -- and you 've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive ; for instance , there 's the arch I 've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground -- and I should have croqueted the Queen 's hedgehog just now , only it ran away when it saw mine coming ! '
` How do you like the Queen ? '
said the Cat in a low voice .
` Not at all , ' said Alice : ` she 's so extremely -- ' Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her , listening : so she went on , ' -- likely to win , that it 's hardly worth while finishing the game . '
The Queen smiled and passed on .
` Who ARE you talking to ? '
said the King , going up to Alice , and looking at the Cat 's head with great curiosity .
` It 's a friend of mine -- a Cheshire Cat , ' said Alice : ` allow me to introduce it . ' '
I do n't like the look of it at all , ' said the King : ` however , it may kiss my hand if it likes . '
` I 'd rather not , ' the Cat remarked .
` Do n't be impertinent , ' said the King , ` and do n't look at me like that ! '
He got behind Alice as he spoke . '
A cat may look at a king , ' said Alice .
` I 've read that in some book , but I do n't remember where . '
` Well , it must be removed , ' said the King very decidedly , and he called the Queen , who was passing at the moment , ` My dear !
I wish you would have this cat removed ! '
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties , great or small .
` Off with his head ! '
she said , without even looking round .
` I 'll fetch the executioner myself , ' said the King eagerly , and he hurried off .
Alice thought she might as well go back , and see how the game was going on , as she heard the Queen 's voice in the distance , screaming with passion .
She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns , and she did not like the look of things at all , as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not .
So she went in search of her hedgehog .
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog , which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other : the only difficulty was , that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden , where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree .
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back , the fight was over , and both the hedgehogs were out of sight : ` but it does n't matter much , ' thought Alice , ` as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground . '
So she tucked it away under her arm , that it might not escape again , and went back for a little more conversation with her friend .
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat , she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it : there was a dispute going on between the executioner , the King , and the Queen , who were all talking at once , while all the rest were quite silent , and looked very uncomfortable .
The moment Alice appeared , she was appealed to by all three to settle the question , and they repeated their arguments to her , though , as they all spoke at once , she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said .
The executioner 's argument was , that you could n't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a thing before , and he was n't going to begin at HIS time of life .
The King 's argument was , that anything that had a head could be beheaded , and that you were n't to talk nonsense .
The Queen 's argument was , that if something was n't done about it in less than no time she 'd have everybody executed , all round .
-LRB- It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious . -RRB-
Alice could think of nothing else to say but ` It belongs to the Duchess : you 'd better ask HER about it . '
` She 's in prison , ' the Queen said to the executioner : ` fetch her here . '
And the executioner went off like an arrow .
The Cat 's head began fading away the moment he was gone , and , by the time he had come back with the Duchess , it had entirely disappeared ; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it , while the rest of the party went back to the game .
CHAPTER IX .
The Mock Turtle 's Story ` You ca n't think how glad I am to see you again , you dear old thing ! '
said the Duchess , as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice 's , and they walked off together .
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper , and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen .
` When I 'M a Duchess , ' she said to herself , -LRB- not in a very hopeful tone though -RRB- , ' I wo n't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL .
Soup does very well without -- Maybe it 's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered , ' she went on , very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule , ` and vinegar that makes them sour -- and camomile that makes them bitter -- and -- and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered .
I only wish people knew that : then they would n't be so stingy about it , you know -- ' She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time , and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear .
` You 're thinking about something , my dear , and that makes you forget to talk .
I ca n't tell you just now what the moral of that is , but I shall remember it in a bit . '
` Perhaps it has n't one , ' Alice ventured to remark .
` Tut , tut , child ! '
said the Duchess .
` Everything 's got a moral , if only you can find it . '
And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice 's side as she spoke .
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her : first , because the Duchess was VERY ugly ; and secondly , because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice 's shoulder , and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin .
However , she did not like to be rude , so she bore it as well as she could .
` The game 's going on rather better now , ' she said , by way of keeping up the conversation a little . ''
Tis so , ' said the Duchess : ` and the moral of that is -- `` Oh , 't is love , 't is love , that makes the world go round ! '' '
` Somebody said , ' Alice whispered , ` that it 's done by everybody minding their own business ! '
` Ah , well !
It means much the same thing , ' said the Duchess , digging her sharp little chin into Alice 's shoulder as she added , ` and the moral of THAT is -- `` Take care of the sense , and the sounds will take care of themselves . '' '
` How fond she is of finding morals in things ! '
Alice thought to herself . '
I dare say you 're wondering why I do n't put my arm round your waist , ' the Duchess said after a pause : ` the reason is , that I 'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo .
Shall I try the experiment ? '
` HE might bite , ' Alice cautiously replied , not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried .
` Very true , ' said the Duchess : ` flamingoes and mustard both bite .
And the moral of that is -- `` Birds of a feather flock together . '' '
` Only mustard is n't a bird , ' Alice remarked .
` Right , as usual , ' said the Duchess : ` what a clear way you have of putting things ! '
` It 's a mineral , I THINK , ' said Alice .
` Of course it is , ' said the Duchess , who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said ; ` there 's a large mustard-mine near here .
And the moral of that is -- `` The more there is of mine , the less there is of yours . '' '
` Oh , I know ! '
exclaimed Alice , who had not attended to this last remark , ` it 's a vegetable .
It does n't look like one , but it is . ' '
I quite agree with you , ' said the Duchess ; ` and the moral of that is -- `` Be what you would seem to be '' -- or if you 'd like it put more simply -- `` Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise . '' ' '
I think I should understand that better , ' Alice said very politely , ` if I had it written down : but I ca n't quite follow it as you say it . '
` That 's nothing to what I could say if I chose , ' the Duchess replied , in a pleased tone .
` Pray do n't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that , ' said Alice .
` Oh , do n't talk about trouble ! '
said the Duchess . '
I make you a present of everything I 've said as yet . ' '
A cheap sort of present ! '
thought Alice .
` I 'm glad they do n't give birthday presents like that ! '
But she did not venture to say it out loud .
` Thinking again ? '
the Duchess asked , with another dig of her sharp little chin .
` I 've a right to think , ' said Alice sharply , for she was beginning to feel a little worried .
` Just about as much right , ' said the Duchess , ` as pigs have to fly ; and the m -- ' But here , to Alice 's great surprise , the Duchess 's voice died away , even in the middle of her favourite word ` moral , ' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble .
Alice looked up , and there stood the Queen in front of them , with her arms folded , frowning like a thunderstorm . '
A fine day , your Majesty ! '
the Duchess began in a low , weak voice .
` Now , I give you fair warning , ' shouted the Queen , stamping on the ground as she spoke ; ` either you or your head must be off , and that in about half no time !
Take your choice ! '
The Duchess took her choice , and was gone in a moment .
` Let 's go on with the game , ' the Queen said to Alice ; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word , but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground .
The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen 's absence , and were resting in the shade : however , the moment they saw her , they hurried back to the game , the Queen merely remarking that a moment 's delay would cost them their lives .
All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players , and shouting ` Off with his head ! '
or ` Off with her head ! '
Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers , who of course had to leave off being arches to do this , so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left , and all the players , except the King , the Queen , and Alice , were in custody and under sentence of execution .
Then the Queen left off , quite out of breath , and said to Alice , ` Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet ? '
` No , ' said Alice . '
I do n't even know what a Mock Turtle is . '
` It 's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from , ' said the Queen . '
I never saw one , or heard of one , ' said Alice .
` Come on , then , ' said the Queen , ` and he shall tell you his history , ' As they walked off together , Alice heard the King say in a low voice , to the company generally , ` You are all pardoned . '
` Come , THAT 'S a good thing ! '
she said to herself , for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered .
They very soon came upon a Gryphon , lying fast asleep in the sun .
-LRB- IF you do n't know what a Gryphon is , look at the picture . -RRB-
` Up , lazy thing ! '
said the Queen , ` and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle , and to hear his history .
I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered ' ; and she walked off , leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon .
Alice did not quite like the look of the creature , but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen : so she waited .
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes : then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight : then it chuckled .
` What fun ! '
said the Gryphon , half to itself , half to Alice .
` What IS the fun ? '
said Alice .
` Why , SHE , ' said the Gryphon .
` It 's all her fancy , that : they never executes nobody , you know .
Come on ! '
` Everybody says `` come on ! ''
here , ' thought Alice , as she went slowly after it : ' I never was so ordered about in all my life , never ! '
They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance , sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock , and , as they came nearer , Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break .
She pitied him deeply .
` What is his sorrow ? '
she asked the Gryphon , and the Gryphon answered , very nearly in the same words as before , ` It 's all his fancy , that : he has n't got no sorrow , you know .
Come on ! '
So they went up to the Mock Turtle , who looked at them with large eyes full of tears , but said nothing .
` This here young lady , ' said the Gryphon , ` she wants for to know your history , she do . '
` I 'll tell it her , ' said the Mock Turtle in a deep , hollow tone : ` sit down , both of you , and do n't speak a word till I 've finished . '
So they sat down , and nobody spoke for some minutes .
Alice thought to herself , ' I do n't see how he can EVEN finish , if he does n't begin . '
But she waited patiently .
` Once , ' said the Mock Turtle at last , with a deep sigh , ' I was a real Turtle . '
These words were followed by a very long silence , broken only by an occasional exclamation of ` Hjckrrh ! '
from the Gryphon , and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle .
Alice was very nearly getting up and saying , ` Thank you , sir , for your interesting story , ' but she could not help thinking there MUST be more to come , so she sat still and said nothing .
` When we were little , ' the Mock Turtle went on at last , more calmly , though still sobbing a little now and then , ` we went to school in the sea .
The master was an old Turtle -- we used to call him Tortoise -- ' ` Why did you call him Tortoise , if he was n't one ? '
Alice asked .
` We called him Tortoise because he taught us , ' said the Mock Turtle angrily : ` really you are very dull ! '
` You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question , ' added the Gryphon ; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice , who felt ready to sink into the earth .
At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle , ` Drive on , old fellow !
Do n't be all day about it ! '
and he went on in these words : ` Yes , we went to school in the sea , though you may n't believe it -- ' ' I never said I did n't ! '
interrupted Alice .
` You did , ' said the Mock Turtle .
` Hold your tongue ! '
added the Gryphon , before Alice could speak again .
The Mock Turtle went on .
` We had the best of educations -- in fact , we went to school every day -- ' ` I 'VE been to a day-school , too , ' said Alice ; ` you need n't be so proud as all that . '
` With extras ? '
asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously .
` Yes , ' said Alice , ` we learned French and music . '
` And washing ? '
said the Mock Turtle .
` Certainly not ! '
said Alice indignantly .
` Ah !
then yours was n't a really good school , ' said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief .
` Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill , `` French , music , AND WASHING -- extra . '' '
` You could n't have wanted it much , ' said Alice ; ` living at the bottom of the sea . ' '
I could n't afford to learn it . '
said the Mock Turtle with a sigh . '
I only took the regular course . '
` What was that ? '
inquired Alice .
` Reeling and Writhing , of course , to begin with , ' the Mock Turtle replied ; ` and then the different branches of Arithmetic -- Ambition , Distraction , Uglification , and Derision . ' '
I never heard of `` Uglification , '' ' Alice ventured to say .
` What is it ? '
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise .
` What !
Never heard of uglifying ! '
it exclaimed .
` You know what to beautify is , I suppose ? '
` Yes , ' said Alice doubtfully : ` it means -- to -- make -- anything -- prettier . '
` Well , then , ' the Gryphon went on , ` if you do n't know what to uglify is , you ARE a simpleton . '
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it , so she turned to the Mock Turtle , and said ` What else had you to learn ? '
` Well , there was Mystery , ' the Mock Turtle replied , counting off the subjects on his flappers , ' -- Mystery , ancient and modern , with Seaography : then Drawling -- the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel , that used to come once a week : HE taught us Drawling , Stretching , and Fainting in Coils . '
` What was THAT like ? '
said Alice .
` Well , I ca n't show it you myself , ' the Mock Turtle said : ` I 'm too stiff .
And the Gryphon never learnt it . '
` Had n't time , ' said the Gryphon : ' I went to the Classics master , though .
He was an old crab , HE was . ' '
I never went to him , ' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh : ` he taught Laughing and Grief , they used to say . '
` So he did , so he did , ' said the Gryphon , sighing in his turn ; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws .
` And how many hours a day did you do lessons ? '
said Alice , in a hurry to change the subject .
` Ten hours the first day , ' said the Mock Turtle : ` nine the next , and so on . '
` What a curious plan ! '
exclaimed Alice .
` That 's the reason they 're called lessons , ' the Gryphon remarked : ` because they lessen from day to day . '
This was quite a new idea to Alice , and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark .
` Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday ? '
` Of course it was , ' said the Mock Turtle .
` And how did you manage on the twelfth ? '
Alice went on eagerly .
` That 's enough about lessons , ' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone : ` tell her something about the games now . '
CHAPTER X .
The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply , and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes .
He looked at Alice , and tried to speak , but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice .
` Same as if he had a bone in his throat , ' said the Gryphon : and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back .
At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice , and , with tears running down his cheeks , he went on again : -- ` You may not have lived much under the sea -- ' -LRB- ' I have n't , ' said Alice -RRB- -- ` and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster -- ' -LRB- Alice began to say ' I once tasted -- ' but checked herself hastily , and said ` No , never ' -RRB- ' -- so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is ! '
` No , indeed , ' said Alice .
` What sort of a dance is it ? '
` Why , ' said the Gryphon , ` you first form into a line along the sea-shore -- ' ` Two lines ! '
cried the Mock Turtle .
` Seals , turtles , salmon , and so on ; then , when you 've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way -- ' ` THAT generally takes some time , ' interrupted the Gryphon . '
-- you advance twice -- ' ` Each with a lobster as a partner ! '
cried the Gryphon .
` Of course , ' the Mock Turtle said : ` advance twice , set to partners -- ' ' -- change lobsters , and retire in same order , ' continued the Gryphon .
` Then , you know , ' the Mock Turtle went on , ` you throw the -- ' ` The lobsters ! '
shouted the Gryphon , with a bound into the air . '
-- as far out to sea as you can -- ' ` Swim after them ! '
screamed the Gryphon .
` Turn a somersault in the sea ! '
cried the Mock Turtle , capering wildly about .
` Change lobsters again ! '
yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice .
` Back to land again , and that 's all the first figure , ' said the Mock Turtle , suddenly dropping his voice ; and the two creatures , who had been jumping about like mad things all this time , sat down again very sadly and quietly , and looked at Alice .
` It must be a very pretty dance , ' said Alice timidly .
` Would you like to see a little of it ? '
said the Mock Turtle .
` Very much indeed , ' said Alice .
` Come , let 's try the first figure ! '
said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon .
` We can do without lobsters , you know .
Which shall sing ? '
` Oh , YOU sing , ' said the Gryphon .
` I 've forgotten the words . '
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice , every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close , and waving their forepaws to mark the time , while the Mock Turtle sang this , very slowly and sadly : -- ' `` Will you walk a little faster ? ''
said a whiting to a snail .
`` There 's a porpoise close behind us , and he 's treading on my tail .
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance !
They are waiting on the shingle -- will you come and join the dance ?
Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , will you join the dance ?
Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , wo n't you join the dance ?
`` You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea ! ''
But the snail replied `` Too far , too far ! ''
and gave a look askance -- Said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance .
Would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the dance .
Would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance . '
`` What matters it how far we go ? ''
his scaly friend replied .
`` There is another shore , you know , upon the other side .
The further off from England the nearer is to France -- Then turn not pale , beloved snail , but come and join the dance .
Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , will you join the dance ?
Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , wo n't you join the dance ? '' '
` Thank you , it 's a very interesting dance to watch , ' said Alice , feeling very glad that it was over at last : ` and I do so like that curious song about the whiting ! '
` Oh , as to the whiting , ' said the Mock Turtle , ` they -- you 've seen them , of course ? '
` Yes , ' said Alice , ` I 've often seen them at dinn -- ' she checked herself hastily . '
I do n't know where Dinn may be , ' said the Mock Turtle , ` but if you 've seen them so often , of course you know what they 're like . ' '
I believe so , ' Alice replied thoughtfully .
` They have their tails in their mouths -- and they 're all over crumbs . '
` You 're wrong about the crumbs , ' said the Mock Turtle : ` crumbs would all wash off in the sea .
But they HAVE their tails in their mouths ; and the reason is -- ' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes .
-- ` Tell her about the reason and all that , ' he said to the Gryphon .
` The reason is , ' said the Gryphon , ` that they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance .
So they got thrown out to sea .
So they had to fall a long way .
So they got their tails fast in their mouths .
So they could n't get them out again .
That 's all . '
` Thank you , ' said Alice , ` it 's very interesting .
I never knew so much about a whiting before . ' '
I can tell you more than that , if you like , ' said the Gryphon .
` Do you know why it 's called a whiting ? ' '
I never thought about it , ' said Alice .
` Why ? '
` IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES . '
the Gryphon replied very solemnly .
Alice was thoroughly puzzled .
` Does the boots and shoes ! '
she repeated in a wondering tone .
` Why , what are YOUR shoes done with ? '
said the Gryphon . '
I mean , what makes them so shiny ? '
Alice looked down at them , and considered a little before she gave her answer .
` They 're done with blacking , I believe . '
` Boots and shoes under the sea , ' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice , ` are done with a whiting .
Now you know . '
` And what are they made of ? '
Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity .
` Soles and eels , of course , ' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently : ` any shrimp could have told you that . '
` If I 'd been the whiting , ' said Alice , whose thoughts were still running on the song , ` I 'd have said to the porpoise , `` Keep back , please : we do n't want YOU with us ! '' '
` They were obliged to have him with them , ' the Mock Turtle said : ` no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise . '
` Would n't it really ? '
said Alice in a tone of great surprise .
` Of course not , ' said the Mock Turtle : ` why , if a fish came to ME , and told me he was going a journey , I should say `` With what porpoise ? '' '
` Do n't you mean `` purpose '' ? '
said Alice . '
I mean what I say , ' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone .
And the Gryphon added ` Come , let 's hear some of YOUR adventures . ' '
I could tell you my adventures -- beginning from this morning , ' said Alice a little timidly : ` but it 's no use going back to yesterday , because I was a different person then . '
` Explain all that , ' said the Mock Turtle .
` No , no !
The adventures first , ' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone : ` explanations take such a dreadful time . '
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit .
She was a little nervous about it just at first , the two creatures got so close to her , one on each side , and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide , but she gained courage as she went on .
Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating ` YOU ARE OLD , FATHER WILLIAM , ' to the Caterpillar , and the words all coming different , and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath , and said ` That 's very curious . '
` It 's all about as curious as it can be , ' said the Gryphon .
` It all came different ! '
the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully . '
I should like to hear her try and repeat something now .
Tell her to begin . '
He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice .
` Stand up and repeat '' 'T IS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD , '' ' said the Gryphon .
` How the creatures order one about , and make one repeat lessons ! '
thought Alice ; ' I might as well be at school at once . '
However , she got up , and began to repeat it , but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille , that she hardly knew what she was saying , and the words came very queer indeed : -- '' Tis the voice of the Lobster ; I heard him declare , `` You have baked me too brown , I must sugar my hair . ''
As a duck with its eyelids , so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons , and turns out his toes . '
-LSB- later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry , he is gay as a lark , And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark , But , when the tide rises and sharks are around , His voice has a timid and tremulous sound . -RSB-
` That 's different from what I used to say when I was a child , ' said the Gryphon .
` Well , I never heard it before , ' said the Mock Turtle ; ` but it sounds uncommon nonsense . '
Alice said nothing ; she had sat down with her face in her hands , wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again . '
I should like to have it explained , ' said the Mock Turtle .
` She ca n't explain it , ' said the Gryphon hastily .
` Go on with the next verse . '
` But about his toes ? '
the Mock Turtle persisted .
` How COULD he turn them out with his nose , you know ? '
` It 's the first position in dancing . '
Alice said ; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing , and longed to change the subject .
` Go on with the next verse , ' the Gryphon repeated impatiently : ` it begins `` I passed by his garden . '' '
Alice did not dare to disobey , though she felt sure it would all come wrong , and she went on in a trembling voice : -- ' I passed by his garden , and marked , with one eye , How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie -- ' -LSB- later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust , and gravy , and meat , While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat .
When the pie was all finished , the Owl , as a boon , Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon : While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl , And concluded the banquet -- -RSB- ` What IS the use of repeating all that stuff , ' the Mock Turtle interrupted , ` if you do n't explain it as you go on ?
It 's by far the most confusing thing I ever heard ! '
` Yes , I think you 'd better leave off , ' said the Gryphon : and Alice was only too glad to do so .
` Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille ? '
the Gryphon went on .
` Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song ? '
` Oh , a song , please , if the Mock Turtle would be so kind , ' Alice replied , so eagerly that the Gryphon said , in a rather offended tone , ` Hm !
No accounting for tastes !
Sing her `` Turtle Soup , '' will you , old fellow ? '
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply , and began , in a voice sometimes choked with sobs , to sing this : -- ` Beautiful Soup , so rich and green , Waiting in a hot tureen !
Who for such dainties would not stoop ?
Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup !
Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup !
Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop !
Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop !
Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beautiful Soup !
` Beautiful Soup !
Who cares for fish , Game , or any other dish ?
Who would not give all else for two Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup ?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup ?
Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop !
Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop !
Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beauti -- FUL SOUP ! '
` Chorus again ! '
cried the Gryphon , and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it , when a cry of ` The trial 's beginning ! '
was heard in the distance .
` Come on ! '
cried the Gryphon , and , taking Alice by the hand , it hurried off , without waiting for the end of the song .
` What trial is it ? '
Alice panted as she ran ; but the Gryphon only answered ` Come on ! '
and ran the faster , while more and more faintly came , carried on the breeze that followed them , the melancholy words : -- ` Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beautiful Soup ! '
CHAPTER XI .
Who Stole the Tarts ?
The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived , with a great crowd assembled about them -- all sorts of little birds and beasts , as well as the whole pack of cards : the Knave was standing before them , in chains , with a soldier on each side to guard him ; and near the King was the White Rabbit , with a trumpet in one hand , and a scroll of parchment in the other .
In the very middle of the court was a table , with a large dish of tarts upon it : they looked so good , that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them -- ' I wish they 'd get the trial done , ' she thought , ` and hand round the refreshments ! '
But there seemed to be no chance of this , so she began looking at everything about her , to pass away the time .
Alice had never been in a court of justice before , but she had read about them in books , and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there .
` That 's the judge , ' she said to herself , ` because of his great wig . '
The judge , by the way , was the King ; and as he wore his crown over the wig , -LRB- look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it , -RRB- he did not look at all comfortable , and it was certainly not becoming .
` And that 's the jury-box , ' thought Alice , ` and those twelve creatures , ' -LRB- she was obliged to say ` creatures , ' you see , because some of them were animals , and some were birds , -RRB- ' I suppose they are the jurors . '
She said this last word two or three times over to herself , being rather proud of it : for she thought , and rightly too , that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all .
However , ` jury-men ' would have done just as well .
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates .
` What are they doing ? '
Alice whispered to the Gryphon .
` They ca n't have anything to put down yet , before the trial 's begun . '
` They 're putting down their names , ' the Gryphon whispered in reply , ` for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial . '
` Stupid things ! '
Alice began in a loud , indignant voice , but she stopped hastily , for the White Rabbit cried out , ` Silence in the court ! '
and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round , to make out who was talking .
Alice could see , as well as if she were looking over their shoulders , that all the jurors were writing down ` stupid things ! '
on their slates , and she could even make out that one of them did n't know how to spell ` stupid , ' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him . '
A nice muddle their slates 'll be in before the trial 's over ! '
thought Alice .
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked .
This of course , Alice could not stand , and she went round the court and got behind him , and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away .
She did it so quickly that the poor little juror -LRB- it was Bill , the Lizard -RRB- could not make out at all what had become of it ; so , after hunting all about for it , he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day ; and this was of very little use , as it left no mark on the slate .
` Herald , read the accusation ! '
said the King .
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet , and then unrolled the parchment scroll , and read as follows : -- ` The Queen of Hearts , she made some tarts , All on a summer day : The Knave of Hearts , he stole those tarts , And took them quite away ! '
` Consider your verdict , ' the King said to the jury .
` Not yet , not yet ! '
the Rabbit hastily interrupted .
` There 's a great deal to come before that ! '
` Call the first witness , ' said the King ; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet , and called out , ` First witness ! '
The first witness was the Hatter .
He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other . '
I beg pardon , your Majesty , ' he began , ` for bringing these in : but I had n't quite finished my tea when I was sent for . '
` You ought to have finished , ' said the King .
` When did you begin ? '
The Hatter looked at the March Hare , who had followed him into the court , arm-in-arm with the Dormouse .
` Fourteenth of March , I think it was , ' he said .
` Fifteenth , ' said the March Hare .
` Sixteenth , ' added the Dormouse .
` Write that down , ' the King said to the jury , and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates , and then added them up , and reduced the answer to shillings and pence .
` Take off your hat , ' the King said to the Hatter .
` It is n't mine , ' said the Hatter .
` Stolen ! '
the King exclaimed , turning to the jury , who instantly made a memorandum of the fact . '
I keep them to sell , ' the Hatter added as an explanation ; ` I 've none of my own .
I 'm a hatter . '
Here the Queen put on her spectacles , and began staring at the Hatter , who turned pale and fidgeted .
` Give your evidence , ' said the King ; ` and do n't be nervous , or I 'll have you executed on the spot . '
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all : he kept shifting from one foot to the other , looking uneasily at the Queen , and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter .
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation , which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was : she was beginning to grow larger again , and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court ; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her . '
I wish you would n't squeeze so . '
said the Dormouse , who was sitting next to her . '
I can hardly breathe . ' '
I ca n't help it , ' said Alice very meekly : ` I 'm growing . '
` You 've no right to grow here , ' said the Dormouse .
` Do n't talk nonsense , ' said Alice more boldly : ` you know you 're growing too . '
` Yes , but I grow at a reasonable pace , ' said the Dormouse : ` not in that ridiculous fashion . '
And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court .
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter , and , just as the Dormouse crossed the court , she said to one of the officers of the court , ` Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert ! '
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so , that he shook both his shoes off .
` Give your evidence , ' the King repeated angrily , ` or I 'll have you executed , whether you 're nervous or not . '
` I 'm a poor man , your Majesty , ' the Hatter began , in a trembling voice , ' -- and I had n't begun my tea -- not above a week or so -- and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin -- and the twinkling of the tea -- ' ` The twinkling of the what ? '
said the King .
` It began with the tea , ' the Hatter replied .
` Of course twinkling begins with a T ! '
said the King sharply .
` Do you take me for a dunce ?
Go on ! '
` I 'm a poor man , ' the Hatter went on , ` and most things twinkled after that -- only the March Hare said -- ' ' I did n't ! '
the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry .
` You did ! '
said the Hatter . '
I deny it ! '
said the March Hare .
` He denies it , ' said the King : ` leave out that part . '
` Well , at any rate , the Dormouse said -- ' the Hatter went on , looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too : but the Dormouse denied nothing , being fast asleep .
` After that , ' continued the Hatter , ' I cut some more bread-and-butter -- ' ` But what did the Dormouse say ? '
one of the jury asked .
` That I ca n't remember , ' said the Hatter .
` You MUST remember , ' remarked the King , ` or I 'll have you executed . '
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter , and went down on one knee .
` I 'm a poor man , your Majesty , ' he began .
` You 're a very poor speaker , ' said the King .
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered , and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court .
-LRB- As that is rather a hard word , I will just explain to you how it was done .
They had a large canvas bag , which tied up at the mouth with strings : into this they slipped the guinea-pig , head first , and then sat upon it . -RRB-
` I 'm glad I 've seen that done , ' thought Alice .
` I 've so often read in the newspapers , at the end of trials , `` There was some attempts at applause , which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court , '' and I never understood what it meant till now . '
` If that 's all you know about it , you may stand down , ' continued the King . '
I ca n't go no lower , ' said the Hatter : ` I 'm on the floor , as it is . '
` Then you may SIT down , ' the King replied .
Here the other guinea-pig cheered , and was suppressed .
` Come , that finished the guinea-pigs ! '
thought Alice .
` Now we shall get on better . '
` I 'd rather finish my tea , ' said the Hatter , with an anxious look at the Queen , who was reading the list of singers .
` You may go , ' said the King , and the Hatter hurriedly left the court , without even waiting to put his shoes on . '
-- and just take his head off outside , ' the Queen added to one of the officers : but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door .
` Call the next witness ! '
said the King .
The next witness was the Duchess 's cook .
She carried the pepper-box in her hand , and Alice guessed who it was , even before she got into the court , by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once .
` Give your evidence , ' said the King .
` Sha n't , ' said the cook .
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit , who said in a low voice , ` Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness . '
` Well , if I must , I must , ' the King said , with a melancholy air , and , after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight , he said in a deep voice , ` What are tarts made of ? '
` Pepper , mostly , ' said the cook .
` Treacle , ' said a sleepy voice behind her .
` Collar that Dormouse , ' the Queen shrieked out .
` Behead that Dormouse !
Turn that Dormouse out of court !
Suppress him !
Pinch him !
Off with his whiskers ! '
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion , getting the Dormouse turned out , and , by the time they had settled down again , the cook had disappeared .
` Never mind ! '
said the King , with an air of great relief .
` Call the next witness . '
And he added in an undertone to the Queen , ` Really , my dear , YOU must cross-examine the next witness .
It quite makes my forehead ache ! '
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list , feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like , ' -- for they have n't got much evidence YET , ' she said to herself .
Imagine her surprise , when the White Rabbit read out , at the top of his shrill little voice , the name ` Alice ! '
CHAPTER XII .
Alice 's Evidence ` Here ! '
cried Alice , quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes , and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt , upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below , and there they lay sprawling about , reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before .
` Oh , I BEG your pardon ! '
she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay , and began picking them up again as quickly as she could , for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head , and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box , or they would die .
` The trial can not proceed , ' said the King in a very grave voice , ` until all the jurymen are back in their proper places -- ALL , ' he repeated with great emphasis , looking hard at Alice as he said do .
Alice looked at the jury-box , and saw that , in her haste , she had put the Lizard in head downwards , and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way , being quite unable to move .
She soon got it out again , and put it right ; ` not that it signifies much , ' she said to herself ; ' I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other . '
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset , and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them , they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident , all except the Lizard , who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open , gazing up into the roof of the court .
` What do you know about this business ? '
the King said to Alice .
` Nothing , ' said Alice .
` Nothing WHATEVER ? '
persisted the King .
` Nothing whatever , ' said Alice .
` That 's very important , ' the King said , turning to the jury .
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates , when the White Rabbit interrupted : ` UNimportant , your Majesty means , of course , ' he said in a very respectful tone , but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke .
` UNimportant , of course , I meant , ' the King hastily said , and went on to himself in an undertone , ` important -- unimportant -- unimportant -- important -- ' as if he were trying which word sounded best .
Some of the jury wrote it down ` important , ' and some ` unimportant . '
Alice could see this , as she was near enough to look over their slates ; ` but it does n't matter a bit , ' she thought to herself .
At this moment the King , who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book , cackled out ` Silence ! '
and read out from his book , ` Rule Forty-two .
ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT . '
Everybody looked at Alice .
` I 'M not a mile high , ' said Alice .
` You are , ' said the King .
` Nearly two miles high , ' added the Queen .
` Well , I sha n't go , at any rate , ' said Alice : ` besides , that 's not a regular rule : you invented it just now . '
` It 's the oldest rule in the book , ' said the King .
` Then it ought to be Number One , ' said Alice .
The King turned pale , and shut his note-book hastily .
` Consider your verdict , ' he said to the jury , in a low , trembling voice .
` There 's more evidence to come yet , please your Majesty , ' said the White Rabbit , jumping up in a great hurry ; ` this paper has just been picked up . '
` What 's in it ? '
said the Queen . '
I have n't opened it yet , ' said the White Rabbit , ` but it seems to be a letter , written by the prisoner to -- to somebody . '
` It must have been that , ' said the King , ` unless it was written to nobody , which is n't usual , you know . '
` Who is it directed to ? '
said one of the jurymen .
` It is n't directed at all , ' said the White Rabbit ; ` in fact , there 's nothing written on the OUTSIDE . '
He unfolded the paper as he spoke , and added ` It is n't a letter , after all : it 's a set of verses . '
` Are they in the prisoner 's handwriting ? '
asked another of the jurymen .
` No , they 're not , ' said the White Rabbit , ` and that 's the queerest thing about it . '
-LRB- The jury all looked puzzled . -RRB-
` He must have imitated somebody else 's hand , ' said the King .
-LRB- The jury all brightened up again . -RRB-
` Please your Majesty , ' said the Knave , ' I did n't write it , and they ca n't prove I did : there 's no name signed at the end . '
` If you did n't sign it , ' said the King , ` that only makes the matter worse .
You MUST have meant some mischief , or else you 'd have signed your name like an honest man . '
There was a general clapping of hands at this : it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day .
` That PROVES his guilt , ' said the Queen .
` It proves nothing of the sort ! '
said Alice .
` Why , you do n't even know what they 're about ! '
` Read them , ' said the King .
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles .
` Where shall I begin , please your Majesty ? '
he asked .
` Begin at the beginning , ' the King said gravely , ` and go on till you come to the end : then stop . '
These were the verses the White Rabbit read : -- ` They told me you had been to her , And mentioned me to him : She gave me a good character , But said I could not swim .
He sent them word I had not gone -LRB- We know it to be true -RRB- : If she should push the matter on , What would become of you ?
I gave her one , they gave him two , You gave us three or more ; They all returned from him to you , Though they were mine before .
If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair , He trusts to you to set them free , Exactly as we were .
My notion was that you had been -LRB- Before she had this fit -RRB- An obstacle that came between Him , and ourselves , and it .
Do n't let him know she liked them best , For this must ever be A secret , kept from all the rest , Between yourself and me . '
` That 's the most important piece of evidence we 've heard yet , ' said the King , rubbing his hands ; ` so now let the jury -- ' ` If any one of them can explain it , ' said Alice , -LRB- she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she was n't a bit afraid of interrupting him , -RRB- ` I 'll give him sixpence .
I do n't believe there 's an atom of meaning in it . '
The jury all wrote down on their slates , ` SHE does n't believe there 's an atom of meaning in it , ' but none of them attempted to explain the paper .
` If there 's no meaning in it , ' said the King , ` that saves a world of trouble , you know , as we need n't try to find any .
And yet I do n't know , ' he went on , spreading out the verses on his knee , and looking at them with one eye ; ' I seem to see some meaning in them , after all . ''
-- SAID I COULD NOT SWIM -- '' you ca n't swim , can you ? '
he added , turning to the Knave .
The Knave shook his head sadly .
` Do I look like it ? '
he said .
-LRB- Which he certainly did NOT , being made entirely of cardboard . -RRB-
` All right , so far , ' said the King , and he went on muttering over the verses to himself : ' `` WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE -- '' that 's the jury , of course -- `` I GAVE HER ONE , THEY GAVE HIM TWO -- '' why , that must be what he did with the tarts , you know -- ' ` But , it goes on `` THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU , '' ' said Alice .
` Why , there they are ! '
said the King triumphantly , pointing to the tarts on the table .
` Nothing can be clearer than THAT .
Then again -- `` BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT -- '' you never had fits , my dear , I think ? '
he said to the Queen .
` Never ! '
said the Queen furiously , throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke .
-LRB- The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger , as he found it made no mark ; but he now hastily began again , using the ink , that was trickling down his face , as long as it lasted . -RRB-
` Then the words do n't FIT you , ' said the King , looking round the court with a smile .
There was a dead silence .
` It 's a pun ! '
the King added in an offended tone , and everybody laughed , ` Let the jury consider their verdict , ' the King said , for about the twentieth time that day .
` No , no ! '
said the Queen .
` Sentence first -- verdict afterwards . '
` Stuff and nonsense ! '
said Alice loudly .
` The idea of having the sentence first ! '
` Hold your tongue ! '
said the Queen , turning purple . '
I wo n't ! '
said Alice .
` Off with her head ! '
the Queen shouted at the top of her voice .
Nobody moved .
` Who cares for you ? '
said Alice , -LRB- she had grown to her full size by this time . -RRB-
` You 're nothing but a pack of cards ! '
At this the whole pack rose up into the air , and came flying down upon her : she gave a little scream , half of fright and half of anger , and tried to beat them off , and found herself lying on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face .
` Wake up , Alice dear ! '
said her sister ; ` Why , what a long sleep you 've had ! '
` Oh , I 've had such a curious dream ! '
said Alice , and she told her sister , as well as she could remember them , all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about ; and when she had finished , her sister kissed her , and said , ` It WAS a curious dream , dear , certainly : but now run in to your tea ; it 's getting late . '
So Alice got up and ran off , thinking while she ran , as well she might , what a wonderful dream it had been .
But her sister sat still just as she left her , leaning her head on her hand , watching the setting sun , and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures , till she too began dreaming after a fashion , and this was her dream : -- First , she dreamed of little Alice herself , and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee , and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers -- she could hear the very tones of her voice , and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes -- and still as she listened , or seemed to listen , the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister 's dream .
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by -- the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool -- she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal , and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution -- once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess 's knee , while plates and dishes crashed around it -- once more the shriek of the Gryphon , the squeaking of the Lizard 's slate-pencil , and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs , filled the air , mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle .
So she sat on , with closed eyes , and half believed herself in Wonderland , though she knew she had but to open them again , and all would change to dull reality -- the grass would be only rustling in the wind , and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds -- the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells , and the Queen 's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy -- and the sneeze of the baby , the shriek of the Gryphon , and all the other queer noises , would change -LRB- she knew -RRB- to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard -- while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle 's heavy sobs .
Lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would , in the after-time , be herself a grown woman ; and how she would keep , through all her riper years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather about her other little children , and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale , perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows , and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own child-life , and the happy summer days .

A Patent Medicine Testimonial `` You might as well try to move the rock of Gibraltar as attempt to change Uncle Abimelech 's mind when it is once made up , '' said Murray gloomily .
Murray is like dear old Dad ; he gets discouraged rather easily .
Now , I 'm not like that ; I 'm more like Mother 's folks .
As Uncle Abimelech has never failed to tell me when I have annoyed him , I 'm `` all Foster . ''
Uncle Abimelech does n't like the Fosters .
But I 'm glad I take after them .
If I had folded my hands and sat down meekly when Uncle Abimelech made known his good will and pleasure regarding Murray and me after Father 's death , Murray would never have got to college -- nor I either , for that matter .
Only I would n't have minded that very much .
I just wanted to go to college because Murray did .
I could n't be separated from him .
We were twins and had always been together .
As for Uncle Abimelech 's mind , I knew that he never had been known to change it .
But , as he himself was fond of saying , there has to be a first time for everything , and I had determined that this was to be the first time for him .
I had n't any idea how I was going to bring it about ; but it just had to be done , and I 'm not `` all Foster '' for nothing .
I knew I would have to depend on my own thinkers .
Murray is clever at books and dissecting dead things , but he could n't help me out in this , even if he had n't settled beforehand that there was no use in opposing Uncle Abimelech .
`` I 'm going up to the garret to think this out , Murray , '' I said solemnly .
`` Do n't let anybody disturb me , and if Uncle Abimelech comes over do n't tell him where I am .
If I do n't come down in time to get tea , get it yourself .
I shall not leave the garret until I have thought of some way to change Uncle Abimelech 's mind . ''
`` Then you 'll be a prisoner there for the term of your natural life , dear sis , '' said Murray sceptically .
`` You 're a clever girl , Prue -- and you 've got enough decision for two -- but you 'll never get the better of Uncle Abimelech . ''
`` We 'll see , '' I said resolutely , and up to the garret I went .
I shut the door and bolted it good and fast to make sure .
Then I piled some old cushions in the window seat -- for one might as well be comfortable when one is thinking as not -- and went over the whole ground from the beginning .
Outside the wind was thrashing the broad , leafy top of the maple whose tallest twigs reached to the funny grey eaves of our old house .
One roly-poly little sparrow blew or flew to the sill and sat there for a minute , looking at me with knowing eyes .
Down below I could see Murray in a corner of the yard , pottering over a sick duck .
He had set its broken leg and was nursing it back to health .
Anyone except Uncle Abimelech could see that Murray was simply born to be a doctor and that it was flying in the face of Providence to think of making him anything else .
From the garret windows I could see all over the farm , for the house is on the hill end of it .
I could see all the dear old fields and the spring meadow and the beech woods in the southwest corner .
And beyond the orchard were the two grey barns and down below at the right-hand corner was the garden with all my sweet peas fluttering over the fences and trellises like a horde of butterflies .
It was a dear old place and both Murray and I loved every stick and stone on it , but there was no reason why we should go on living there when Murray did n't like farming .
And it was n't our own , anyhow .
It all belonged to Uncle Abimelech .
Father and Murray and I had always lived here together .
Father 's health broke down during his college course .
That was one reason why Uncle Abimelech was set against Murray going to college , although Murray is as chubby and sturdy a fellow as you could wish to see .
Anybody with Foster in him would be that .
To go back to Father .
The doctors told him that his only chance of recovering his strength was an open-air life , so Father rented one of Uncle Abimelech 's farms and there he lived for the rest of his days .
He did not get strong again until it was too late for college , and he was a square peg in a round hole all his life , as he used to tell us .
Mother died before we could remember , so Murray and Dad and I were everything to each other .
We were very happy too , although we were bossed by Uncle Abimelech more or less .
But he meant it well and Father did n't mind .
Then Father died -- oh , that was a dreadful time !
I hurried over it in my thinking-out .
Of course when Murray and I came to look our position squarely in the face we found that we were dependent on Uncle Abimelech for everything , even the roof over our heads .
We were literally as poor as church mice and even poorer , for at least they get churches rent-free .
Murray 's heart was set on going to college and studying medicine .
He asked Uncle Abimelech to lend him enough money to get a start with and then he could work his own way along and pay back the loan in due time .
Uncle Abimelech is rich , and Murray and I are his nearest relatives .
But he simply would n't listen to Murray 's plan .
`` I put my foot firmly down on such nonsense , '' he said .
`` And you know that when I put my foot down something squashes . ''
It was not that Uncle Abimelech was miserly or that he grudged us assistance .
Not at all .
He was ready to deal generously by us , but it must be in his own way .
His way was this .
Murray and I were to stay on the farm , and when Murray was twenty-one Uncle Abimelech said he would deed the farm to him -- make him a present of it out and out .
`` It 's a good farm , Murray , '' he said .
`` Your father never made more than a bare living out of it because he was n't strong enough to work it properly -- that 's what he got out of a college course , by the way .
But you are strong enough and ambitious enough to do well . ''
But Murray could n't be a farmer , that was all there was to it .
I told Uncle Abimelech so , firmly , and I talked to him for days about it , but Uncle Abimelech never wavered .
He sat and listened to me with a quizzical smile on that handsome , clean-shaven , ruddy old face of his , with its cut-granite features .
And in the end he said , `` You ought to be the one to go to college if either of you did , Prue .
You would make a capital lawyer , if I believed in the higher education of women , but I do n't .
Murray can take or leave the farm as he chooses .
If he prefers the latter alternative , well and good .
But he gets no help from me .
You 're a foolish little girl , Prue , to back him up in this nonsense of his . ''
It makes me angry to be called a little girl when I put up my hair a year ago , and Uncle Abimelech knows it .
I gave up arguing with him .
I knew it was no use anyway .
I thought it all over in the garret .
But no way out of the dilemma could I see .
I had eaten up all the apples I had brought with me and I felt flabby and disconsolate .
The sight of Uncle Abimelech stalking up the lane , as erect and lordly as usual , served to deepen my gloom .
I picked up the paper my apples had been wrapped in and looked it over gloomily .
Then I saw something , and Uncle Abimelech was delivered into my hand .
The whole plan of campaign unrolled itself before me , and I fairly laughed in glee , looking out of the garret window right down on the little bald spot on the top of Uncle Abimelech 's head , as he stood laying down the law to Murray about something .
When Uncle Abimelech had gone I went down to Murray .
`` Buddy , '' I said , `` I 've thought of a plan .
I 'm not going to tell you what it is , but you are to consent to it without knowing .
I think it will quench Uncle Abimelech , but you must have perfect confidence in me .
You must back me up no matter what I do and let me have my own way in it all . ''
`` All right , sis , '' said Murray .
`` That is n't solemn enough , '' I protested .
`` I 'm serious .
Promise solemnly . ''
`` I promise solemnly , ` cross my heart , ' '' said Murray , looking like an owl .
`` Very well .
Remember that your role is to lie low and say nothing , like Brer Rabbit .
Alloway 's Anodyne Liniment is pretty good stuff , is n't it , Murray ?
It cured your sprain after you had tried everything else , did n't it ? ''
`` Yes .
But I do n't see the connection . ''
`` It is n't necessary that you should .
Well , what with your sprain and my rheumatics I think I can manage it . ''
`` Look here , Prue .
Are you sure that long brooding over our troubles up in the garret has n't turned your brain ? ''
`` My brain is all right .
Now leave me , minion .
There is that which I would do . ''
Murray grinned and went .
I wrote a letter , took it down to the office , and mailed it .
For a week there was nothing more to do .
There is just one trait of Uncle Abimelech 's disposition more marked than his fondness for having his own way and that one thing is family pride .
The Melvilles are a very old family .
The name dates back to the Norman conquest when a certain Roger de Melville , who was an ancestor of ours , went over to England with William the Conqueror .
I do n't think the Melvilles ever did anything worth recording in history since .
To be sure , as far back as we can trace , none of them has ever done anything bad either .
They have been honest , respectable folks and I think that is something worth being proud of .
But Uncle Abimelech pinned his family pride to Roger de Melville .
He had the Melville coat of arms and our family tree , made out by an eminent genealogist , framed and hung up in his library , and he would not have done anything that would not have chimed in with that coat of arms and a conquering ancestor for the world .
At the end of a week I got an answer to my letter .
It was what I wanted .
I wrote again and sent a parcel .
In three weeks ' time the storm burst .
One day I saw Uncle Abimelech striding up the lane .
He had a big newspaper clutched in his hand .
I turned to Murray , who was poring over a book of anatomy in the corner .
`` Murray , Uncle Abimelech is coming .
There is going to be a battle royal between us .
Allow me to remind you of your promise . ''
`` To lie low and say nothing ?
That 's the cue , is n't it , sis ? ''
`` Unless Uncle Abimelech appeals to you .
In that case you are to back me up . ''
Then Uncle Abimelech stalked in .
He was purple with rage .
Old Roger de Melville himself never could have looked fiercer .
I did feel a quake or two , but I faced Uncle Abimelech undauntedly .
No use in having your name on the roll of Battle Abbey if you ca n't stand your ground .
`` Prudence , what does this mean ? ''
thundered Uncle Abimelech , as he flung the newspaper down on the table .
Murray got up and peered over .
Then he whistled .
He started to say something but remembered just in time and stopped .
But he did give me a black look .
Murray has a sneaking pride of name too , although he wo n't own up to it and laughs at Uncle Abimelech .
I looked at the paper and began to laugh .
We did look so funny , Murray and I , in that advertisement .
It took up the whole page .
At the top were our photos , half life-size , and underneath our names and addresses printed out in full .
Below was the letter I had written to the Alloway Anodyne Liniment folks .
It was a florid testimonial to the virtues of their liniment .
I said that it had cured Murray 's sprain after all other remedies had failed and that , when I had been left a partial wreck from a very bad attack of rheumatic fever , the only thing that restored my joints and muscles to working order was Alloway 's Anodyne Liniment , and so on .
It was all true enough , although I dare say old Aunt Sarah-from-the-Hollow 's rubbing had as much to do with the cures as the liniment .
But that is neither here nor there .
`` What does this mean , Prudence ? ''
said Uncle Abimelech again .
He was quivering with wrath , but I was as cool as a cucumber , and Murray stood like a graven image .
`` Why , that , Uncle Abimelech , '' I said calmly , `` well , it just means one of my ways of making money .
That liniment company pays for those testimonials and photos , you know .
They gave me fifty dollars for the privilege of publishing them .
Fifty dollars will pay for books and tuition for Murray and me at Kentville Academy next winter , and Mrs. Tredgold is kind enough to say she will board me for what help I can give her around the house , and wait for Murray 's until he can earn it by teaching . ''
I rattled all this off glibly before Uncle Abimelech could get in a word .
`` It 's disgraceful ! ''
he stormed .
`` Disgraceful !
Think of Sir Roger de Melville -- and a patent medicine advertisement !
Murray Melville , what were you about , sir , to let your sister disgrace herself and her family name by such an outrageous transaction ? ''
I quaked a bit .
If Murray should fail me !
But Murray was true-blue .
`` I gave Prue a free hand , sir .
It 's an honest business transaction enough -- and the family name alone wo n't send us to college , you know , sir . ''
Uncle Abimelech glared at us .
`` This must be put an end to , '' he said .
`` This advertisement must not appear again .
I wo n't have it ! ''
`` But I 've signed a contract that it is to run for six months , '' I said sturdily .
`` And I 've others in view .
You remember the Herb Cure you recommended one spring and that it did me so much good !
I 'm negotiating with the makers of that and -- '' `` The girl 's mad ! ''
said Uncle Abimelech .
`` Stark , staring mad ! ''
`` Oh , no , I 'm not , Uncle Abimelech .
I 'm merely a pretty good businesswoman .
You wo n't help Murray to go to college , so I must .
This is the only way I have , and I 'm going to see it through . ''
After Uncle Abimelech had gone , still in a towering rage , Murray remonstrated .
But I reminded him of his promise and he had to succumb .
Next day Uncle Abimelech returned -- a subdued and chastened Uncle Abimelech .
`` See here , Prue , '' he said sternly .
`` This thing must be stopped .
I say it must .
I am not going to have the name of Melville dragged all over the country in a patent medicine advertisement .
You 've played your game and won it -- take what comfort you can out of the confession : If you will agree to cancel this notorious contract of yours I 'll settle it with the company -- and I 'll put Murray through college -- and you too if you want to go !
Something will have to be done with you , that 's certain .
Is this satisfactory ? ''
`` Perfectly , '' I said promptly .
`` If you will add thereto your promise that you will forget and forgive , Uncle Abimelech .
There are to be no hard feelings . ''
Uncle Abimelech shrugged his shoulders .
`` In for a penny , in for a pound , '' he said .
`` Very well , Prue .
We wipe off all scores and begin afresh .
But there must be no more such doings .
You 've worked your little scheme through -- trust a Foster for that !
But in future you 've got to remember that in law you 're a Melville whatever you are in fact . ''
I nodded dutifully .
`` I 'll remember , Uncle Abimelech , '' I promised .
After everything had been arranged and Uncle Abimelech had gone I looked at Murray .
`` Well ? ''
I said .
Murray twinkled .
`` You 've accomplished the impossible , sis .
But , as Uncle Abimelech intimated -- do n't you try it again . ''
A Sandshore Wooing Fir Cottage , Plover Sands .
July Sixth .
We arrived here late last night , and all day Aunt Martha has kept her room to rest .
So I had to keep mine also , although I felt as fresh as a morning lark , and just in the mood for enjoyment .
My name is Marguerite Forrester -- an absurdly long name for so small a girl .
Aunt Martha always calls me Marguer_ite , with an accent of strong disapproval .
She does not like my name , but she gives me the full benefit of it .
Connie Shelmardine used to call me Rita .
Connie was my roommate last year at the Seminary .
We correspond occasionally , but Aunt Martha frowns on it .
I have always lived with Aunt Martha -- my parents died when I was a baby .
Aunt Martha says I am to be her heiress if I please her -- which means -- but , oh , you do not know what `` pleasing '' Aunt Martha means .
Aunt is a determined and inveterate man-hater .
She has no particular love for women , indeed , and trusts nobody but Mrs. Saxby , her maid .
I rather like Mrs. Saxby .
She is not quite so far gone in petrifaction as Aunt , although she gets a little stonier every year .
I expect the process will soon begin on me , but it has n't yet .
My flesh and blood are still unreasonably warm and pulsing and rebellious .
Aunt Martha would be in danger of taking a fit if she ever saw me talking to a man .
She watches me jealously , firmly determined to guard me from any possible attack of a roaring and ravening lion in the disguise of nineteenth-century masculine attire .
So I have to walk demurely and assume a virtue , if I have it not , while I pine after the untested flesh-pots of Egypt in secret .
We have come down to spend a few weeks at Fir Cottage .
Our good landlady is a capacious , kindly-souled creature , and I think she has rather a liking for me .
I have been chattering to her all day , for there are times when I absolutely must talk to someone or go mad .
July Tenth .
This sort of life is decidedly dull .
The program of every day is the same .
I go to the sandshore with Aunt Martha and Mrs. Saxby in the morning , read to Aunt in the afternoons , and mope around by my disconsolate self in the evenings .
Mrs. Blake has lent me , for shore use , a very fine spyglass which she owns .
She says her `` man '' brought it home from `` furrin ' parts '' before he died .
While Aunt and Mrs. Saxby meander up and down the shore , leaving me free to a certain extent , I amuse myself by examining distant seas and coasts through it , thus getting a few peeps into a forbidden world .
We see few people , although there is a large summer hotel about a mile up the beach .
Our shore haunts do not seem to be popular with its guests .
They prefer the rocks .
This suits Aunt Martha admirably .
I may also add that it does n't suit her niece -- but that is a matter of small importance .
The first morning I noticed a white object on the rocks , about half a mile away , and turned my glass on it .
There -- apparently within a stone 's throw of me -- was a young man .
He was lounging on a rock , looking dreamily out to sea .
There was something about his face that reminded me of someone I know , but I can not remember whom .
Every morning he has reappeared on the same spot .
He seems to be a solitary individual , given to prowling by himself .
I wonder what Aunt would say if she knew what I am so earnestly watching through my glass at times .
July Eleventh .
I shall have to cease looking at the Unknown , I am afraid .
This morning I turned my glass , as usual , on his pet haunt .
I nearly fell over in my astonishment , for he was also looking through a spyglass straight at me , too , it seemed .
How foolish I felt !
And yet my curiosity was so strong that a few minutes afterward I peeped back again , just to see what he was doing .
Then he coolly laid down his glass , rose , lifted his cap and bowed politely to me -- or , at least , in my direction .
I dropped my glass and smiled in a mixture of dismay and amusement .
Then I remembered that he was probably watching me again , and might imagine my smile was meant for him .
I banished it immediately , shut my glass up and did not touch it again .
Soon after we came home .
July Twelfth .
Something has happened at last .
Today I went to the shore as usual , fully resolved not even to glance in the forbidden direction .
But in the end I had to take a peep , and saw him on the rocks with his glass levelled at me .
When he saw that I was looking he laid down the glass , held up his hands , and began to spell out something in the deaf-mute alphabet .
Now , I know that same alphabet .
Connie taught it to me last year , so that we might hold communication across the schoolroom .
I gave one frantic glance at Aunt Martha 's rigid back , and then watched him while he deftly spelled : `` I am Francis Shelmardine .
Are you not Miss Forrester , my sister 's friend ? ''
Francis Shelmardine !
Now I knew whom he resembled .
And have I not heard endless dissertations from Connie on this wonderful brother of hers , Francis the clever , the handsome , the charming , until he has become the only hero of dreams I have ever had ?
It was too wonderful .
I could only stare dazedly back through my glass .
`` May we know each other ? ''
he went on .
`` May I come over and introduce myself ?
Right hand , yes ; left , no . ''
I gasped !
Suppose he were to come ?
What would happen ?
I waved my left hand sorrowfully .
He looked quite crestfallen and disappointed as he spelled out : `` Why not ?
Would your friends disapprove ? ''
I signalled : `` Yes . ''
`` Are you displeased at my boldness ? ''
was his next question .
Where had all Aunt Martha 's precepts flown to then ?
I blush to record that I lifted my left hand shyly and had just time to catch his pleased expression when Aunt Martha came up and said it was time to go home .
So I picked myself meekly up , shook the sand from my dress , and followed my good aunt dutifully home .
July Thirteenth .
When we went to the shore this morning I had to wait in spasms of remorse and anxiety until Aunt got tired of reading and set off along the shore with Mrs. Saxby .
Then I reached for my glass .
Mr. Shelmardine and I had quite a conversation .
Under the circumstances there could be no useless circumlocution in our exchange of ideas .
It was religiously `` boiled down , '' and ran something like this : `` You are not displeased with me ? ''
`` No -- but I should be . ''
`` Why ? ''
`` It is wrong to deceive Aunt . ''
`` I am quite respectable . ''
`` That is not the question . ''
`` Can not her prejudices be overcome ? ''
`` Absolutely no . ''
`` Mrs. Allardyce , who is staying at the hotel , knows her well .
Shall I bring her over to vouch for my character ? ''
`` It would not do a bit of good . ''
`` Then it is hopeless . ''
`` Yes . ''
`` Would you object to knowing me on your own account ? ''
`` No . ''
`` Do you ever come to the shore alone ? ''
`` No .
Aunt would not permit me . ''
`` Must she know ? ''
`` Yes .
I would not come without her permission . ''
`` You will not refuse to chat with me thus now and then ? ''
`` I do n't know .
Perhaps not . ''
I had to go home then .
As we went Mrs. Saxby complimented me on my good colour .
Aunt Martha looked her disapproval .
If I were really ill Aunt would spend her last cent in my behalf , but she would be just as well pleased to see me properly pale and subdued at all times , and not looking as if I were too well contented in this vale of tears .
July Seventeenth .
I have `` talked '' a good deal with Mr. Shelmardine these past four days .
He is to be at the beach for some weeks longer .
This morning he signalled across from the rocks : `` I mean to see you at last .
Tomorrow I will walk over and pass you . ''
`` You must not .
Aunt will suspect . ''
`` No danger .
Do n't be alarmed .
I will do nothing rash . ''
I suppose he will .
He seems to be very determined .
Of course , I can not prevent him from promenading on our beach all day if he chooses .
But then if he did , Aunt would speedily leave him in sole possession of it .
I wonder what I had better wear tomorrow .
July Nineteenth .
Yesterday morning Aunt Martha was serene and unsuspicious .
It is dreadful of me to be deceiving her and I do feel guilty .
I sat down on the sand and pretended to read the `` Memoirs of a Missionary '' -- Aunt likes cheerful books like that -- in an agony of anticipation .
Presently Aunt said , majestically : `` Marguer_ite , there is a man coming this way .
We will move further down . ''
And we moved .
Poor Aunt !
Mr. Shelmardine came bravely on .
I felt my heart beating to my very finger tips .
He halted by the fragment of an old stranded boat .
Aunt had turned her back on him .
I ventured on a look .
He lifted his hat with a twinkle in his eye .
Just then Aunt said , icily : `` We will go home , Marguer_ite .
That creature evidently intends to persist in his intrusion . ''
Home we came accordingly .
This morning he signalled across : `` Letter from Connie .
Message for you .
I mean to deliver it personally .
Do you ever go to church ? ''
Now , I do go regularly to church at home .
But Aunt Martha and Mrs. Saxby are both such rigid church people that they would not darken the doors of the Methodist church at Plover Sands for any consideration .
Needless to say , I am not allowed to go either .
But it was impossible to make this long explanation , so I merely replied : `` Not here . ''
`` Will you not go tomorrow morning ? ''
`` Aunt will not let me . ''
`` Coax her . ''
`` Coaxing never has any effect on her . ''
`` Would she relent if Mrs. Allardyce were to call for you ? ''
Now , I have been cautiously sounding Aunt about Mrs. Allardyce , and I have discovered that she disapproves of her .
So I said : `` It would be useless .
I will ask Aunt if I may go , but I feel almost sure that she will not consent . ''
This evening , when Aunt was in an unusually genial mood , I plucked up heart of grace and asked her .
`` Marguer_ite , '' she said impressively , `` you know that I do not attend church here . ''
`` But , Aunt , '' I persisted , quakingly , `` could n't I go alone ?
It is not very far -- and I will be very careful . ''
Aunt merely gave me a look that said about forty distinct and separate things , and I was turning away in despair when Mrs. Saxby -- bless her heart -- said : `` I really think it would be no harm to let the child go . ''
As Aunt attaches great importance to Mrs. Saxby 's opinion , she looked at me relentingly and said : `` Well , I will think it over and let you know in the morning , Marguer_ite . ''
Now , everything depends on the sort of humour Aunt is in in the morning .
July Twentieth .
This morning was perfect , and after breakfast Aunt said , condescendingly : `` I think you may attend church if you wish , Marguer_ite .
Remember that I expect you to conduct yourself with becoming prudence and modesty . ''
I flew upstairs and pulled my prettiest dress out of my trunk .
It is a delicate , shimmering grey stuff with pearly tints about it .
Every time I get anything new , Aunt Martha and I have a battle royal over it .
I verily believe that Aunt would like me to dress in the fashions in vogue in her youth .
There is always a certain flavour of old-fashionedness about my gowns and hats .
Connie used to say that it was delicious and gave me a piquant uniqueness -- a certain unlikeness to other people that possessed a positive charm .
That is only Connie 's view of it , however .
But I had had my own way about this dress and it is really very becoming .
I wore a little silvery-grey chip hat , trimmed with pale pink flowers , and I pinned at my belt the sweetest cluster of old-fashioned blush rosebuds from the garden .
Then I borrowed a hymn book from Mrs. Blake and ran down to undergo Aunt Martha 's scrutiny .
`` Dear me , child , '' she said discontentedly , `` you have gotten yourself up very frivolously , it seems to me . ''
`` Why , Aunty , '' I protested , `` I 'm all in grey -- every bit . ''
Aunt Martha sniffed .
You do n't know how much Aunt can express in a sniff .
But I tripped to church like a bird .
The first person I saw there was Mr. Shelmardine .
He was sitting right across from me and a smile glimmered in his eyes .
I did not look at him again .
Through the service I was subdued enough to have satisfied even Aunt Martha .
When church came out , he waited for me at the entrance to his pew .
I pretended not to see him until he said `` Good morning , '' in a voice vibrating and deep , which sounded as though it might become infinitely tender if its owner chose .
When we went down the steps he took my hymnal , and we walked up the long , bowery country road .
`` Thank you so much for coming today , '' he said -- as if I went to oblige him .
`` I had a hard time to get Aunt Martha 's consent , '' I declared frankly .
`` I would n't have succeeded if Mrs. Saxby had n't taken my part . ''
`` Heaven bless Mrs. Saxby , '' he remarked fervently .
`` But is there any known way of overcoming your aunt 's scruples ?
If so , I am ready to risk it . ''
`` There is none .
Aunt Martha is very good and kind to me , but she will never stop trying to bring me up .
The process will be going on when I am fifty .
And she hates men !
I do n't know what she would do if she saw me now . ''
Mr. Shelmardine frowned and switched the unoffending daisies viciously with his cane .
`` Then there is no hope of my seeing you openly and above-board ? ''
`` Not at present , '' I said faintly .
After a brief silence we began to talk of other things .
He told me how he happened to see me first .
`` I was curious to know who the people were who were always in the same place at the same time , so one day I took my telescope .
I could see you plainly .
You were reading and had your hat off .
When I went back to the hotel I asked Mrs. Allardyce if she knew who the boarders at Fir Cottage were and she told me .
I had heard Connie speak of you , and I determined to make your acquaintance . ''
When we reached the lane I held out my hand for the hymnal .
`` You must n't come any further , Mr. Shelmardine , '' I said hurriedly .
`` Aunt -- Aunt might see you . ''
He took my hand and held it , looking at me seriously .
`` Suppose I were to walk up to the cottage tomorrow and ask for you ? ''
I gasped .
He looked so capable of doing anything he took it into his head to do .
`` Oh , you would n't , '' I said piteously .
`` Aunt Martha would -- you are not in earnest . ''
`` I suppose not , '' he said regretfully .
`` Of course I would not do anything that would cause you unpleasantness .
But this must not -- shall not be our last meeting . ''
`` Aunt will not let me come to church again , '' I said .
`` Does she ever take a nap in the afternoon ? ''
he queried .
I wriggled my parasol about in the dust uneasily .
`` Sometimes . ''
`` I shall be at the old boat tomorrow afternoon at two-thirty , '' he said .
I pulled my hand away .
`` I could n't -- you know I could n't , '' I cried -- and then I blushed to my ears .
`` Are you sure you could n't ? ''
bending a little nearer .
`` Quite sure , '' I murmured .
He surrendered my hymnal at last .
`` Will you give me a rose ? ''
I unpinned the whole cluster and handed it to him .
He lifted it until it touched his lips .
As for me , I scuttled up the lane in the most undignified fashion .
At the turn I looked back .
He was still standing there with his hat off .
July Twenty-fourth .
On Monday afternoon I slipped away to the shore while Aunt Martha and Mrs. Saxby were taking their regular nap and I was supposed to be reading sermons in my room .
Mr. Shelmardine was leaning against the old boat , but he came swiftly across the sand to meet me .
`` This is very kind of you , '' he said .
`` I ought not to have come , '' I said repentantly .
`` But it is so lonely there -- and one ca n't be interested in sermons and memoirs all the time . ''
Mr. Shelmardine laughed .
`` Mr. and Mrs. Allardyce are on the other side of the boat .
Will you come and meet them ? ''
How nice of him to bring them !
I knew I should like Mrs. Allardyce , just because Aunt Martha did n't .
We had a delightful stroll .
I never thought of the time until Mr. Shelmardine said it was four o'clock .
`` Oh , is it so late as that ? ''
I cried .
`` I must go at once . ''
`` I 'm sorry we have kept you so long , '' remarked Mr. Shelmardine in a tone of concern .
`` If she should be awake , what will the consequences be ? ''
`` Too terrible to think of , '' I answered seriously .
`` I 'm sorry , Mr. Shelmardine , but you must n't come any further . '' ''
We will be here tomorrow afternoon , '' he said .
`` Mr. Shelmardine ! ''
I protested .
`` I wish you would n't put such ideas into my head .
They wo n't come out -- no , not if I read a whole volume of sermons right through . ''
We looked at each other for a second .
Then he began to smile , and we both went off into a peal of laughter .
`` At least let me know if Miss Fiske rampages , '' he called after me as I fled .
But Aunt Martha was not awake -- and I have been to the shore three afternoons since then .
I was there today , and I 'm going tomorrow for a boat sail with Mr. Shelmardine and the Allardyces .
But I am afraid the former will do something rash soon .
This afternoon he said : `` I do n't think I can stand this much longer . ''
`` Stand what ? ''
I asked .
`` You know very well , '' he answered recklessly .
`` Meeting you in this clandestine manner , and thereby causing that poor little conscience of yours such misery .
If your aunt were not so -- unreasonable , I should never have stooped to it . ''
`` It is all my fault , '' I said contritely .
`` Well , I hardly meant that , '' he said grimly .
`` But had n't I better go frankly to your aunt and lay the whole case before her ? ''
`` You would never see me again if you did that , '' I said hastily -- and then wished I had n't .
`` That is the worst threat you could make , '' he said .
July Twenty-fifth .
It is all over , and I am the most miserable girl in the world .
Of course this means that Aunt Martha has discovered everything and the deserved punishment of my sins has overtaken me .
I slipped away again this afternoon and went for that boat sail .
We had a lovely time but were rather late getting in , and I hurried home with many misgivings .
Aunt Martha met me at the door .
My dress was draggled , my hat had slipped back , and the kinks and curls of my obstreperous hair were something awful .
I know I looked very disreputable and also , no doubt , very guilty and conscience-stricken .
Aunt gave me an unutterable look and then followed me up to my room in grim silence .
`` Marguer_ite , what does this mean ? ''
I have lots of faults , but untruthfulness is n't one of them .
I confessed everything -- at least , almost everything .
I did n't tell about the telescopes and deaf-mute alphabet , and Aunt was too horror-stricken to think of asking how I first made Mr. Shelmardine 's acquaintance .
She listened in stony silence .
I had expected a terrible scolding , but I suppose my crimes simply seemed to her too enormous for words .
When I had sobbed out my last word she rose , swept me one glance of withering contempt , and left the room .
Presently Mrs. Saxby came up , looking concerned .
`` My dear child , what have you been doing ?
Your aunt says that we are to go home on the afternoon train tomorrow .
She is terribly upset . ''
I just curled up on the bed and cried , while Mrs. Saxby packed my trunk .
I will have no chance to explain matters to Mr. Shelmardine .
And I will never see him again , for Aunt is quite capable of whisking me off to Africa .
He will just think me a feather-brained flirt .
Oh , I am so unhappy !
July Twenty-sixth .
I am the happiest girl in the world !
That is quite a different strain from yesterday .
We leave Fir Cottage in an hour , but that does n't matter now .
I did not sleep a wink last night and crawled miserably down to breakfast .
Aunt took not the slightest notice of me , but to my surprise she told Mrs. Saxby that she intended taking a farewell walk to the shore .
I knew I would be taken , too , to be kept out of mischief , and my heart gave a great bound of hope .
Perhaps I would have a chance to send word to Francis , since Aunt did not know of the part my spyglass had played in my bad behaviour .
I meekly followed my grim guardians to the shore and sat dejectedly on my rug while they paced the sand .
Francis was on the rocks .
As soon as Aunt Martha and Mrs. Saxby were at a safe distance , I began my message : `` All discovered .
Aunt is very angry .
We go home today . ''
Then I snatched my glass .
His face expressed the direst consternation and dismay .
He signalled : `` I must see you before you go . ''
`` Impossible .
Aunt will never forgive me .
Good-bye . ''
I saw a look of desperate determination cross his face .
If forty Aunt Marthas had swooped down upon me , I could not have torn my eyes from that glass .
`` I love you .
You know it .
Do you care for me ?
I must have my answer now . ''
What a situation !
No time or chance for any maidenly hesitation or softening aureole of words .
Aunt and Mrs. Saxby had almost reached the point where they invariably turned .
I had barely time to spell out a plain , blunt `` yes '' and read his answer .
`` I shall go home at once , get Mother and Connie , follow you , and demand possession of my property .
I shall win the day .
Have no fear .
Till then , good-bye , my darling . ''
`` Marguerite , '' said Mrs. Saxby at my elbow , `` it is time to go . ''
I got up obediently .
Aunt Martha was as grim and uncompromising as ever , and Mrs. Saxby looked like a chief mourner , but do you suppose I cared ?
I dropped behind them just once before we left the shore .
I knew he was watching me and I waved my hand .
I suppose I am really engaged to Francis Shelmardine .
But was there ever such a funny wooing ?
And what will Aunt Martha say ?
After Many Days The square , bare front room of the Baxter Station Hotel -- so called because there was no other house in the place to dispute the title -- was filled with men .
Some of them were putting up at the hotel while they worked at the new branch line , and some of them had dropped in to exchange news and banter while waiting for the mail train .
Gabe Foley , the proprietor , was playing at checkers with one of the railroad men , but was not too deeply absorbed in the game to take in all that was said around him .
The air was dim with tobacco smoke , and the brilliant , scarlet geraniums which Mrs. Foley kept in the bay window looked oddly out of place .
Gabe knew all those present except one man -- a stranger who had landed at Baxter Station from the afternoon freight .
Foley 's hotel did not boast of a register , and the stranger did not volunteer any information regarding his name or business .
He had put in the afternoon and early evening strolling about the village and talking to the men on the branch line .
Now he had come in and ensconced himself in the corner behind the stove , where he preserved a complete silence .
He had a rather rough face and was flashily dressed .
Altogether , Gabe hardly liked his looks , put as long as a man paid his bill and did not stir up a row Gabe Foley did not interfere with him .
Three or four farmers from `` out Greenvale way '' were drawn up by the stove , discussing the cheese factory sales and various Greenvale happenings .
The stranger appeared to be listening to them intently , although he took no part in their conversation .
Presently he brought his tilted chair down with a sharp thud .
Gabe Foley had paused in his manipulation of a king to hurl a question at the Greenvale men .
`` Is it true that old man Strong is to be turned out next week ? ''
`` True enough , '' answered William Jeffers .
`` Joe Moore is going to foreclose .
Stephen Strong has got three years behind with the interest and Moore is out of patience .
It seems hard on old Stephen , but Moore ai n't the man to hesitate for that .
He 'll have his own out of it . ''
`` What will the Strongs do ? ''
asked Gabe .
`` That 's the question everyone in Greenvale is asking .
Lizzie Strong has always been a delicate little girl , but maybe she 'll manage to scare up a living .
Old Stephen is to be the most pitied .
I do n't see anything for him but the poorhouse . ''
`` How did Stephen Strong come to get into such a tight place ? ''
the stranger asked suddenly .
`` When I was in these parts a good many years ago he was considered a well-to-do man . ''
`` Well , so he was , '' replied William Jeffers .
`` But he began to get in debt when his wife took sick .
He spent no end of money on doctors and medicines for her .
And then he seemed to have a streak of bad luck besides -- crops failed and cows died and all that sort of thing .
He 's been going behind ever since .
He kind of lost heart when his wife died .
And now Moore is going to foreclose .
It 's my opinion poor old Stephen wo n't live any time if he 's turned out of his home . ''
`` Do you know what the mortgage comes to ? ''
`` Near three thousand , counting overdue interest . ''
`` Well , I 'm sorry for old Stephen , '' said Gabe , returning to his game .
`` If anybody deserves a peaceful old age he does .
He 's helped more people than you could count , and he was the best Christian in Greenvale , or out of it . ''
`` He was too good , '' said a Greenvale man crustily .
`` He just let himself be imposed upon all his life .
There 's dozens of people owes him and he 's never asked for a cent from them .
And he 's always had some shiftless critter or other hanging round and devouring his substance . ''
`` D'ye mind that Ben Butler who used to be in Greenvale twenty years ago ? ''
asked a third man .
`` If ever there was an imp of Satan 't was him -- old Ezra Butler 's son from the valley .
Old Stephen kept him for three or four years and was as good to him as if he 'd been his own son . ''
`` Most people out our way do mind Ben Butler , '' returned William Jeffers grimly , `` even if he ai n't been heard tell of for twenty years .
He was n't the kind you could forget in a hurry .
Where 'd he go ?
Out to the Kootenay , was n't it ? ''
`` Somewhere there .
He was a reg ` lar young villain -- up to every kind of mischief .
Old Stephen caught him stealing his oats one time and ` stead of giving him a taste of jail for it , as he ought to have done , he just took him right into his family and kept him there for three years .
I used to tell him he 'd be sorry for it , but he always persisted that Ben was n't bad at heart and would come out all right some day .
No matter what the young varmint did old Stephen would make excuses for him -- ` his ma was dead , ' or he ` had n't had no bringing-up . '
I was thankful when he did finally clear out without doing some penitentiary work . ''
`` If poor old Stephen had n't been so open-handed to every unfortunate critter he came across , '' said Gabe , `` he 'd have had more for himself today . ''
The whistle of the mail train cut short the discussion of Stephen Strong 's case .
In a minute the room was vacant , except for the stranger .
When left to himself he also rose and walked out .
Turning away from the station , he struck briskly into the Greenvale road .
About three miles from the station he halted before a house built close to the road .
It was old-fashioned , but large and comfortable-looking , with big barns in the rear and an orchard on the left slope .
The house itself was in the shadow of the firs , but the yard lay out in the moonlight and the strange visitor did not elect to cross it .
Instead , he turned aside into the shadow of the trees around the garden and , leaning against the old rail fence , gave himself up to contemplation of some kind .
There was a light in the kitchen .
The window-blind was not down and he had a fairly good view of the room .
The only visible occupant was a grey-haired old man sitting by the table , reading from a large open volume before him .
The stranger whistled softly .
`` That 's old Stephen -- reading the Bible same as ever , by all that 's holy !
He has n't changed much except that he 's got mighty grey .
He must be close on to seventy .
It 's a shame to turn an old man like him out of house and home .
But Joe Moore always was a genuine skinflint . ''
He drew himself softly up and sat on the fence .
He saw old Stephen Strong close his book , place his spectacles on it , and kneel down by his chair .
The old man remained on his knees for some time and then , taking up his candle , left the kitchen .
The man on the fence still sat there .
Truth to tell , he was chuckling to himself as he recalled all the mischief he had done in the old days -- the doubtful jokes , tricks , and escapades he had gone through with .
He could not help remembering at the same time how patient old Stephen Strong had always been with him .
He recalled the time he had been caught stealing the oats .
How frightened and sullen he had been !
And how gently the old man had talked to him and pointed out the sin of which he had been guilty !
He had never stolen again , but in other respects he had not mended his ways much .
Behind old Stephen 's back he laughed at him and his `` preaching . ''
But Stephen Strong had never lost faith in him .
He had always asserted mildly that `` Ben would come out all right by and by . ''
Ben Butler remembered this too , as he sat on the fence .
He had `` always liked old Stephen , '' he told himself .
He was sorry he had fallen on such evil times .
`` Preaching and praying do n't seem to have brought him out clear after all , '' he said with a chuckle that quickly died away .
Somehow , even in his worst days , Ben Butler had never felt easy when he mocked old Stephen .
`` Three thousand dollars !
I could do it but I reckon I 'd be a blamed fool .
I ai n't a-going to do it .
Three thousand ai n't picked up every day , even in the Kootenay -- ` specially by chaps like me . ''
He patted his pocket knowingly .
Fifteen years previously he had gone to the Kootenay district with visions of making a fortune that were quickly dispelled by reality .
He had squandered his wages as soon as paid , and it was only of late years that he had `` pulled up a bit , '' as he expressed it , and saved his three thousand dollars .
He had brought the money home with him , having some vague notion of buying a farm and `` settling down to do the respectable . ''
But he had already given up the idea .
This country was too blamed quiet for him , he said .
He would go back to the Kootenay , and he knew what he would do with his money .
Jake Perkins and Wade Brown , two `` pals '' of his , were running a flourishing grocery and saloon combined .
They would be glad of another partner with some cash .
It would suit him to a T. `` I 'll clear out tomorrow , '' he mused as he walked back .
`` As long as I stay here old Stephen will haunt me , sure as fate .
Wonder what he was praying for tonight .
He always used to say the Lord would provide , but He do n't appear to have done it .
Well , I ai n't His deputy . ''
The next afternoon Ben Butler went over to Greenvale and called at Stephen Strong 's .
He found only the old man at home .
Old Stephen did not recognize him at first , but made him heartily welcome when he did .
`` Ben , I do declare !
Ben Butler !
How are you ?
How are you ?
Sit down , Ben -- here , take this chair .
Where on earth did you come from ? ''
`` Baxter just now -- Kootenay on the large scale , '' answered Ben .
`` Thought I 'd come over and see you again .
Did n't expect you 'd remember me at all . ''
`` Remember you !
Why , of course I do .
I have n't ever forgot you , Ben .
Many 's the time I 've wondered where you was and how you was getting on .
And you tell me you 've been in the Kootenay !
Well , well , you have seen a good bit more of the world than I ever have .
You 've changed a lot , Ben .
You ai n't a boy no longer .
D'ye mind all the pranks you used to play ? ''
Ben laughed sheepishly .
`` I reckon I do .
But it ai n't myself I come here to talk about -- not much to say if I did .
It 's just been up and down with me .
How are you yourself , sir ?
They were telling me over at Baxter that you were kind of in trouble . ''
The old man 's face clouded over ; all the sparkle went out of his kind blue eyes .
`` Yes , Ben , yes , '' he said , with a heavy sigh .
`` I 've kind of gone downhill , that 's a fact .
The old farm has to go , Ben -- I 'm sorry for that -- I 'd have liked to have ended my days here , but it 's not to be .
I do n't want to complain .
The Lord does all things well .
I have n't a doubt but that it all fits into His wise purposes -- not a doubt , Ben , although it may be kind of hard to see it . ''
Ben was always skittish of `` pious talk . ''
He veered around adroitly .
`` I dunno as the Lord has had much to do with this , sir .
Seems to me as if 't was the other one as was running it , with Joe Moore for deputy .
The main thing , as I look at it , is to get a cinch on him .
How much does the mortgage amount to , sir ? ''
`` About three thousand dollars , interest and all . ''
Old Stephen 's voice trembled .
The future looked very dark to him in his old age .
Ben put his hand inside his coat and brought out a brand-new , plump pocketbook .
He opened it , laid it on his knee , and counted out a number of crisp notes .
`` Here , sir , '' he said , pushing them along the table .
`` I reckon that 'll keep you out of Joe Moore 's clutches .
There 's three thousand there if I ai n't made a mistake .
That 'll set you clear , wo n't it ? ''
`` Ben ! ''
Old Stephen 's voice trembled with amazement .
`` Ben , I ca n't take it .
It would n't be fair -- or right .
I could never pay you back . ''
Ben slipped the rubber band around his wallet and replaced it airily .
`` I do n't want it paid back , sir .
It 's a little gift , so to speak , just to let you know I ai n't ungrateful for all you did for me .
If it had n't been for you I might have been in the penitentiary by now .
As for the money , it may seem a pile to you , but we do n't think anything more of a thousand or so in the Kootenay than you Greenvale folks do of a fiver -- not a bit more .
We do things on a big scale out there . ''
`` But , Ben , are you sure you can afford it -- that you wo n't miss it ? ''
`` Pop sure .
Do n't you worry , I 'm all right . ''
`` Bless you -- bless you ! ''
The tears were running down old Stephen 's face as he gathered up the money with a shaking hand .
`` I always knew you would do well , Ben -- always said it .
I knew you 'd a good heart .
I just ca n't realize this yet -- it seems too good to be true .
The old place saved -- I can die in peace .
Of course , I 'll pay you back some of it anyhow if I 'm spared a while longer .
Bless you , Ben . ''
Ben would not stay long after that .
He said he had to leave on the 4:30 train .
He was relieved when he got away from the old man 's thanks and questions .
Ben did not find it easy to answer some of the latter .
When he was out of sight of the house he sat on a fence and counted up his remaining funds .
`` Just enough to take me back to the Kootenay -- and then begin over again , I s ` pose .
But 't was worth the money to see the old fellow 's face .
He 'd thank the Lord and me , he said .
How Jake and Wade 'd roar to hear them two names in partnership !
But I 'm going to pull up a bit after this , see if I do n't , just to justify the old man 's faith in me .
` Twould be too bad to disappoint him if he 's believed for so long that I was going to turn out all right yet . ''
When the 4:30 train went out Ben Butler stood on the rear platform .
Gabe Foley watched him abstractedly as he receded .
`` Blamed if I know who that fellow was , '' he remarked to a crony .
`` He never told his name , but seems to me I 've seen him before .
He has a kind of hang-dog look , I think .
But he paid up square and it is none of my business . ''
An Unconventional Confidence The Girl in Black-and-Yellow ran frantically down the grey road under the pines .
There was nobody to see her , but she would have run if all Halifax had been looking on .
For had she not on the loveliest new hat -- a `` creation '' in yellow chiffon with big black choux -- and a dress to match ?
And was there not a shower coming straight from the hills across the harbour ?
Down at the end of the long resinous avenue the Girl saw the shore road , with the pavilion shutting out the view of the harbour 's mouth .
Below the pavilion , clean-shaven George 's Island guarded the town like a sturdy bulldog , and beyond it were the wooded hills , already lost in a mist of rain .
`` Oh , I shall be too late , '' moaned the Girl .
But she held her hat steady with one hand and ran on .
If she could only reach the pavilion in time !
It was a neck-and-neck race between the rain and the Girl , but the Girl won .
Just as she flew out upon the shore road , a tall Young Man came pelting down the latter , and they both dashed up the steps of the pavilion together as the rain swooped down upon them and blotted George 's Island and the smoky town and the purple banks of the Eastern Passage from view .
The pavilion was small at the best of times , and just now the rain was beating into it on two sides , leaving only one dry corner .
Into this the Girl moved .
She was flushed and triumphant .
The Young Man thought that in all his life he had never seen anyone so pretty .
`` I 'm so glad I did n't get my hat wet , '' said the Girl breathlessly , as she straightened it with a careful hand and wondered if she looked very blown and blowsy .
`` It would have been a pity , '' admitted the Young Man .
`` It is a very pretty hat . ''
`` Pretty ! ''
The Girl looked the scorn her voice expressed .
`` Anyone can have a pretty hat .
Our cook has one .
This is a creation . ''
`` Of course , '' said the Young Man humbly .
`` I ought to have known .
But I am very stupid . ''
`` Well , I suppose a mere man could n't be expected to understand exactly , '' said the Girl graciously .
She smiled at him in a friendly fashion , and he smiled back .
The Girl thought that she had never seen such lovely brown eyes before .
He could not be a Haligonian .
She was sure she knew all the nice young men with brown eyes in Halifax .
`` Please sit down , '' she said plaintively .
`` I 'm tired . ''
The Young Man smiled again at the idea of his sitting down because the Girl was tired .
But he sat down , and so did she , on the only dry seat to be found .
`` Goodness knows how long this rain will last , '' said the Girl , making herself comfortable and picturesque , `` but I shall stay here until it clears up , if it rains for a week .
I will not have my hat spoiled .
I suppose I should n't have put it on .
Beatrix said it was going to rain .
Beatrix is such a horribly good prophet .
I detest people who are good prophets , do n't you ? ''
`` I think that they are responsible for all the evils that they predict , '' said the Young Man solemnly .
`` That is just what I told Beatrix .
And I was determined to put on this hat and come out to the park today .
I simply had to be alone , and I knew I 'd be alone out here .
Everybody else would be at the football game .
By the way , why are n't you there ? ''
`` I was n't even aware that there was a football game on hand , '' said the Young Man , as if he knew he ought to be ashamed of his ignorance , and was .
`` Dear me , '' said the Girl pityingly .
`` Where can you have been not to have heard of it ?
It 's between the Dalhousie team and the Wanderers .
Almost everybody here is on the Wanderers ' side , because they are Haligonians , but I am not .
I like the college boys best .
Beatrix says that it is just because of my innate contrariness .
Last year I simply screamed myself hoarse with enthusiasm .
The Dalhousie team won the trophy . ''
`` If you are so interested in the game , it is a wonder you did n't go to see it yourself , '' said the Young Man boldly .
`` Well , I just could n't , '' said the Girl with a sigh .
`` If anybody had ever told me that there would be a football game in Halifax , and that I would elect to prowl about by myself in the park instead of going to it , I 'd have laughed them to scorn .
Even Beatrix would never have dared to prophesy that .
But you see it has happened .
I was too crumpled up in my mind to care about football today .
I had to come here and have it out with myself .
That is why I put on my hat .
I thought , perhaps , I might get through with my mental gymnastics in time to go to the game afterwards .
But I did n't .
It is just maddening , too .
I got this hat and dress on purpose to wear to it .
They 're black and yellow , you see -- the Dalhousie colours .
It was my own idea .
I was sure it would make a sensation .
But I could n't go to the game and take any interest in it , feeling as I do , could I , now ? ''
The Young Man said , of course , she could n't .
It was utterly out of the question .
The Girl smiled .
Without a smile , she was charming .
With a smile , she was adorable .
`` I like to have my opinions bolstered up .
Do you know , I want to tell you something ?
May I ? ''
`` You may .
I 'll never tell anyone as long as I live , '' said the Young Man solemnly .
`` I do n't know you and you do n't know me .
That is why I want to tell you about it .
I must tell somebody , and if I told anybody I knew , they 'd tell it all over Halifax .
It is dreadful to be talking to you like this .
Beatrix would have three fits , one after the other , if she saw me .
But Beatrix is a slave to conventionality .
I glory in discarding it at times .
You do n't mind , do you ? ''
`` Not at all , '' said the Young Man sincerely .
The Girl sighed .
`` I have reached that point where I must have a confidant , or go crazy .
Once I could tell things to Beatrix .
That was before she got engaged .
Now she tells everything to him .
There is no earthly way of preventing her .
I 've tried them all .
So , nowadays , when I get into trouble , I tell it out loud to myself in the glass .
It 's a relief , you know .
But that is no good now .
I want to tell it to somebody who can say things back .
Will you promise to say things back ? ''
The Young Man assured her that he would when the proper time came .
`` Very well .
But please do n't look at me while I 'm telling you .
I 'll be sure to blush in places .
When Beatrix wants to be particularly aggravating she says I have lost the art of blushing .
But that is only her way of putting it , you know .
Sometimes I blush dreadfully . ''
The Young Man dragged his eyes from the face under the black-and-yellow hat , and fastened them on a crooked pine tree that hung out over the bank .
`` Well , '' began the Girl , `` the root of the whole trouble is simply this .
There is a young man in England .
I always think of him as the Creature .
He is the son of a man who was Father 's especial crony in boyhood , before Father emigrated to Canada .
Worse than that , he comes of a family which has contracted a vile habit of marrying into our family .
It has come down through the ages so long that it has become chronic .
Father left most of his musty traditions in England , but he brought this pet one with him .
He and this friend agreed that the latter 's son should marry one of Father 's daughters .
It ought to have been Beatrix -- she is the oldest .
But Beatrix had a pug nose .
So Father settled on me .
From my earliest recollection I have been given to understand that just as soon as I grew up there would be a ready-made husband imported from England for me .
I was doomed to it from my cradle .
Now , '' said the Girl , with a tragic gesture , `` I ask you , could anything be more hopelessly , appallingly stupid and devoid of romance than that ? ''
The Young Man shook his head , but did not look at her .
`` It 's pretty bad , '' he admitted .
`` You see , '' said the Girl pathetically , `` the shadow of it has been over my whole life .
Of course , when I was a very little girl I did n't mind it so much .
It was such a long way off and lots of things might happen .
The Creature might run away with some other girl -- or I might have the smallpox -- or Beatrix 's nose might be straight when she grew up .
And if Beatrix 's nose were straight she 'd be a great deal prettier than I am .
But nothing did happen -- and her nose is puggier than ever .
Then when I grew up things were horrid .
I never could have a single little bit of fun .
And Beatrix had such a good time !
She had scores of lovers in spite of her nose .
To be sure , she 's engaged now -- and he 's a horrid , faddy little creature .
But he is her own choice .
She was n't told that there was a man in England whom she must marry by and by , when he got sufficiently reconciled to the idea to come and ask her .
Oh , it makes me furious ! ''
`` Is -- is there -- anyone else ? ''
asked the Young Man hesitatingly .
`` Oh , dear , no .
How could there be ?
Why , you know , I could n't have the tiniest flirtation with another man when I was as good as engaged to the Creature .
That is one of my grievances .
Just think how much fun I 've missed !
I used to rage to Beatrix about it , but she would tell me that I ought to be thankful to have the chance of making such a good match -- the Creature is rich , you know , and clever .
As if I cared how clever or rich he is !
Beatrix made me so cross that I gave up saying anything and sulked by myself .
So they think I 'm quite reconciled to it , but I 'm not . ''
`` He might be very nice after all , '' suggested the Young Man . ''
Nice !
That is n't the point .
Oh , do n't you see ?
But no , you 're a man -- you ca n't understand .
You must just take my word for it .
The whole thing makes me furious .
But I have n't told you the worst .
The Creature is on his way out to Canada now .
He may arrive here at any minute .
And they are all so aggravatingly delighted over it . ''
`` What do you suppose he feels like ? ''
asked the Young Man reflectively .
`` Well , '' said the Girl frankly , `` I 've been too much taken up with my own feelings to worry about his .
But I daresay they are pretty much like mine .
He must loathe and detest the very thought of me . ''
`` Oh , I do n't think he does , '' said the Young Man gravely .
`` Do n't you ?
Well , what do you suppose he does think of it all ?
You ought to understand the man 's part of it better than I can . ''
`` There 's as much difference in men as in women , '' said the Young Man in an impersonal tone .
`` I may be right or wrong , you see , but I imagine he would feel something like this : From boyhood he has understood that away out in Canada there is a little girl growing up who is some day to be his wife .
She becomes his boyish ideal of all that is good and true .
He pictures her as beautiful and winsome and sweet .
She is his heart 's lady , and the thought of her abides with him as a safeguard and an inspiration .
For her sake he resolves to make the most of himself , and live a clean , loyal life .
When she comes to him she must find his heart fit to receive her .
There is never a time in all his life when the dream of her does not gleam before him as of a star to which he may aspire with all reverence and love . ''
The Young Man stopped abruptly , and looked at the Girl .
She bent forward with shining eyes , and touched his hand .
`` You are splendid , '' she said softly .
`` If he thought so -- but no -- I am sure he does n't .
He 's just coming out here like a martyr going to the stake .
He knows he will be expected to propose to me when he gets here .
And he knows that I know it too .
And he knows and I know that I will be expected to say my very prettiest ` yes . ' ''
`` But are you going to say it ? ''
asked the Young Man anxiously .
The Girl leaned forward .
`` No .
That is my secret .
I am going to say a most emphatic ` no . ' ''
`` But wo n't your family make an awful row ? ''
`` Of course .
But I rather enjoy a row now and then .
It stirs up one 's grey matter so nicely .
I came out here this afternoon and thought the whole affair over from beginning to end .
And I have determined to say ` no . ' ''
`` Oh , I would n't make it so irreconcilable as that , '' said the Young Man lightly .
`` I 'd leave a loophole of escape .
You see , if you were to like him a little better than you expect , it would be awkward to have committed yourself by a rash vow to saying ` no , ' would n't it ? ''
`` I suppose it would , '' said the Girl thoughtfully , `` but then , you know , I wo n't change my mind . ''
`` It 's just as well to be on the safe side , '' said the Young Man .
The Girl got up .
The rain was over and the sun was coming out through the mists .
`` Perhaps you are right , '' she said .
`` So I 'll just resolve that I will say ` no ' if I do n't want to say ` yes . '
That really amounts to the same thing , you know .
Thank you so much for letting me tell you all about it .
It must have bored you terribly , but it has done me so much good .
I feel quite calm and rational now , and can go home and behave myself .
Goodbye . ''
`` Goodbye , '' said the Young Man gravely .
He stood on the pavilion and watched the Girl out of sight beyond the pines .
When the Girl got home she was told that the Dalhousie team had won the game , eight to four .
The Girl dragged her hat off and waved it joyously .
`` What a shame I was n't there !
They 'd have gone mad over my dress . ''
But the next item of information crushed her .
The Creature had arrived .
He had called that afternoon , and was coming to dinner that night .
`` How fortunate , '' said the Girl , as she went to her room , `` that I relieved my mind to that Young Man out in the park today .
If I had come back with all that pent-up feeling seething within me and heard this news right on top of it all , I might have flown into a thousand pieces .
What lovely brown eyes he had !
I do dote on brown eyes .
The Creature will be sure to have fishy blue ones . ''
* * * * * When the Girl went down to meet the Creature she found herself confronted by the Young Man .
For the first , last , and only time in her life , the Girl had not a word to say .
But her family thought her confusion very natural and pretty .
They really had not expected her to behave so well .
As for the Young Man , his manner was flawless .
Toward the end of the dinner , when the Girl was beginning to recover herself , he turned to her .
`` You know I promised never to tell , '' he said .
`` Be sure you do n't , then , '' said the Girl meekly .
`` But are n't you glad you left the loophole ? ''
he persisted .
The Girl smiled down into her lap .
`` Perhaps , '' she said .
Aunt Cyrilla 's Christmas Basket When Lucy Rose met Aunt Cyrilla coming downstairs , somewhat flushed and breathless from her ascent to the garret , with a big , flat-covered basket hanging over her plump arm , she gave a little sigh of despair .
Lucy Rose had done her brave best for some years -- in fact , ever since she had put up her hair and lengthened her skirts -- to break Aunt Cyrilla of the habit of carrying that basket with her every time she went to Pembroke ; but Aunt Cyrilla still insisted on taking it , and only laughed at what she called Lucy Rose 's `` finicky notions . ''
Lucy Rose had a horrible , haunting idea that it was extremely provincial for her aunt always to take the big basket , packed full of country good things , whenever she went to visit Edward and Geraldine .
Geraldine was so stylish , and might think it queer ; and then Aunt Cyrilla always would carry it on her arm and give cookies and apples and molasses taffy out of it to every child she encountered and , just as often as not , to older folks too .
Lucy Rose , when she went to town with Aunt Cyrilla , felt chagrined over this -- all of which goes to prove that Lucy was as yet very young and had a great deal to learn in this world .
That troublesome worry over what Geraldine would think nerved her to make a protest in this instance .
`` Now , Aunt C'rilla , '' she pleaded , `` you 're surely not going to take that funny old basket to Pembroke this time -- Christmas Day and all . '' ''
` Deed and ` deed I am , '' returned Aunt Cyrilla briskly , as she put it on the table and proceeded to dust it out .
`` I never went to see Edward and Geraldine since they were married that I did n't take a basket of good things along with me for them , and I 'm not going to stop now .
As for it 's being Christmas , all the more reason .
Edward is always real glad to get some of the old farmhouse goodies .
He says they beat city cooking all hollow , and so they do . ''
`` But it 's so countrified , '' moaned Lucy Rose .
`` Well , I am countrified , '' said Aunt Cyrilla firmly , `` and so are you .
And what 's more , I do n't see that it 's anything to be ashamed of .
You 've got some real silly pride about you , Lucy Rose .
You 'll grow out of it in time , but just now it is giving you a lot of trouble . ''
`` The basket is a lot of trouble , '' said Lucy Rose crossly .
`` You 're always mislaying it or afraid you will .
And it does look so funny to be walking through the streets with that big , bulgy basket hanging on your arm . ''
`` I 'm not a mite worried about its looks , '' returned Aunt Cyrilla calmly .
`` As for its being a trouble , why , maybe it is , but I have that , and other people have the pleasure of it .
Edward and Geraldine do n't need it -- I know that -- but there may be those that will .
And if it hurts your feelings to walk ` longside of a countrified old lady with a countrified basket , why , you can just fall behind , as it were . ''
Aunt Cyrilla nodded and smiled good-humouredly , and Lucy Rose , though she privately held to her own opinion , had to smile too .
`` Now , let me see , '' said Aunt Cyrilla reflectively , tapping the snowy kitchen table with the point of her plump , dimpled forefinger , `` what shall I take ?
That big fruit cake for one thing -- Edward does like my fruit cake ; and that cold boiled tongue for another .
Those three mince pies too , they 'd spoil before we got back or your uncle 'd make himself sick eating them -- mince pie is his besetting sin .
And that little stone bottle full of cream -- Geraldine may carry any amount of style , but I 've yet to see her look down on real good country cream , Lucy Rose ; and another bottle of my raspberry vinegar .
That plate of jelly cookies and doughnuts will please the children and fill up the chinks , and you can bring me that box of ice-cream candy out of the pantry , and that bag of striped candy sticks your uncle brought home from the corner last night .
And apples , of course -- three or four dozen of those good eaters -- and a little pot of my greengage preserves -- Edward 'll like that .
And some sandwiches and pound cake for a snack for ourselves .
Now , I guess that will do for eatables .
The presents for the children can go in on top .
There 's a doll for Daisy and the little boat your uncle made for Ray and a tatted lace handkerchief apiece for the twins , and the crochet hood for the baby .
Now , is that all ? ''
`` There 's a cold roast chicken in the pantry , '' said Lucy Rose wickedly , `` and the pig Uncle Leo killed is hanging up in the porch .
Could n't you put them in too ? ''
Aunt Cyrilla smiled broadly .
`` Well , I guess we 'll leave the pig alone ; but since you have reminded me of it , the chicken may as well go in .
I can make room . ''
Lucy Rose , in spite of her prejudices , helped with the packing and , not having been trained under Aunt Cyrilla 's eye for nothing , did it very well too , with much clever economy of space .
But when Aunt Cyrilla had put in as a finishing touch a big bouquet of pink and white everlastings , and tied the bulging covers down with a firm hand , Lucy Rose stood over the basket and whispered vindictively : `` Some day I 'm going to burn this basket -- when I get courage enough .
Then there 'll be an end of lugging it everywhere we go like a -- like an old market-woman . ''
Uncle Leopold came in just then , shaking his head dubiously .
He was not going to spend Christmas with Edward and Geraldine , and perhaps the prospect of having to cook and eat his Christmas dinner all alone made him pessimistic .
`` I mistrust you folks wo n't get to Pembroke tomorrow , '' he said sagely .
`` It 's going to storm . ''
Aunt Cyrilla did not worry over this .
She believed matters of this kind were fore-ordained , and she slept calmly .
But Lucy Rose got up three times in the night to see if it were storming , and when she did sleep had horrible nightmares of struggling through blinding snowstorms dragging Aunt Cyrilla 's Christmas basket along with her .
It was not snowing in the early morning , and Uncle Leopold drove Aunt Cyrilla and Lucy Rose and the basket to the station , four miles off .
When they reached there the air was thick with flying flakes .
The stationmaster sold them their tickets with a grim face .
`` If there 's any more snow comes , the trains might as well keep Christmas too , '' he said .
`` There 's been so much snow already that traffic is blocked half the time , and now there ai n't no place to shovel the snow off onto . ''
Aunt Cyrilla said that if the train were to get to Pembroke in time for Christmas , it would get there ; and she opened her basket and gave the stationmaster and three small boys an apple apiece .
`` That 's the beginning , '' groaned Lucy Rose to herself .
When their train came along Aunt Cyrilla established herself in one seat and her basket in another , and looked beamingly around her at her fellow travellers .
These were few in number -- a delicate little woman at the end of the car , with a baby and four other children , a young girl across the aisle with a pale , pretty face , a sunburned lad three seats ahead in a khaki uniform , a very handsome , imposing old lady in a sealskin coat ahead of him , and a thin young man with spectacles opposite .
`` A minister , '' reflected Aunt Cyrilla , beginning to classify , `` who takes better care of other folks ' souls than of his own body ; and that woman in the sealskin is discontented and cross at something -- got up too early to catch the train , maybe ; and that young chap must be one of the boys not long out of the hospital .
That woman 's children look as if they had n't enjoyed a square meal since they were born ; and if that girl across from me has a mother , I 'd like to know what the woman means , letting her daughter go from home in this weather in clothes like that . ''
Lucy Rose merely wondered uncomfortably what the others thought of Aunt Cyrilla 's basket .
They expected to reach Pembroke that night , but as the day wore on the storm grew worse .
Twice the train had to stop while the train hands dug it out .
The third time it could not go on .
It was dusk when the conductor came through the train , replying brusquely to the questions of the anxious passengers .
`` A nice lookout for Christmas -- no , impossible to go on or back -- track blocked for miles -- what 's that , madam ?
-- no , no station near -- woods for miles .
We 're here for the night .
These storms of late have played the mischief with everything . ''
`` Oh , dear , '' groaned Lucy Rose .
Aunt Cyrilla looked at her basket complacently .
`` At any rate , we wo n't starve , '' she said .
The pale , pretty girl seemed indifferent .
The sealskin lady looked crosser than ever .
The khaki boy said , `` Just my luck , '' and two of the children began to cry .
Aunt Cyrilla took some apples and striped candy sticks from her basket and carried them to them .
She lifted the oldest into her ample lap and soon had them all around her , laughing and contented .
The rest of the travellers straggled over to the corner and drifted into conversation .
The khaki boy said it was hard lines not to get home for Christmas , after all .
`` I was invalided from South Africa three months ago , and I 've been in the hospital at Netley ever since .
Reached Halifax three days ago and telegraphed the old folks I 'd eat my Christmas dinner with them , and to have an extra-big turkey because I did n't have any last year .
They 'll be badly disappointed . ''
He looked disappointed too .
One khaki sleeve hung empty by his side .
Aunt Cyrilla passed him an apple .
`` We were all going down to Grandpa 's for Christmas , '' said the little mother 's oldest boy dolefully .
`` We 've never been there before , and it 's just too bad . ''
He looked as if he wanted to cry but thought better of it and bit off a mouthful of candy .
`` Will there be any Santa Claus on the train ? ''
demanded his small sister tearfully .
`` Jack says there wo n't . ''
`` I guess he 'll find you out , '' said Aunt Cyrilla reassuringly .
The pale , pretty girl came up and took the baby from the tired mother .
`` What a dear little fellow , '' she said softly .
`` Are you going home for Christmas too ? ''
asked Aunt Cyrilla .
The girl shook her head .
`` I have n't any home .
I 'm just a shop girl out of work at present , and I 'm going to Pembroke to look for some . ''
Aunt Cyrilla went to her basket and took out her box of cream candy .
`` I guess we might as well enjoy ourselves .
Let 's eat it all up and have a good time .
Maybe we 'll get down to Pembroke in the morning . ''
The little group grew cheerful as they nibbled , and even the pale girl brightened up .
The little mother told Aunt Cyrilla her story aside .
She had been long estranged from her family , who had disapproved of her marriage .
Her husband had died the previous summer , leaving her in poor circumstances .
`` Father wrote to me last week and asked me to let bygones be bygones and come home for Christmas .
I was so glad .
And the children 's hearts were set on it .
It seems too bad that we are not to get there .
I have to be back at work the morning after Christmas . ''
The khaki boy came up again and shared the candy .
He told amusing stories of campaigning in South Africa .
The minister came too , and listened , and even the sealskin lady turned her head over her shoulder .
By and by the children fell asleep , one on Aunt Cyrilla 's lap and one on Lucy Rose 's , and two on the seat .
Aunt Cyrilla and the pale girl helped the mother make up beds for them .
The minister gave his overcoat and the sealskin lady came forward with a shawl .
`` This will do for the baby , '' she said .
`` We must get up some Santa Claus for these youngsters , '' said the khaki boy .
`` Let 's hang their stockings on the wall and fill 'em up as best we can .
I 've nothing about me but some hard cash and a jack-knife .
I 'll give each of 'em a quarter and the boy can have the knife . ''
`` I 've nothing but money either , '' said the sealskin lady regretfully .
Aunt Cyrilla glanced at the little mother .
She had fallen asleep with her head against the seat-back .
`` I 've got a basket over there , '' said Aunt Cyrilla firmly , `` and I 've some presents in it that I was taking to my nephew 's children .
I 'm going to give 'em to these .
As for the money , I think the mother is the one for it to go to .
She 's been telling me her story , and a pitiful one it is .
Let 's make up a little purse among us for a Christmas present . ''
The idea met with favour .
The khaki boy passed his cap and everybody contributed .
The sealskin lady put in a crumpled note .
When Aunt Cyrilla straightened it out she saw that it was for twenty dollars .
Meanwhile , Lucy Rose had brought the basket .
She smiled at Aunt Cyrilla as she lugged it down the aisle and Aunt Cyrilla smiled back .
Lucy Rose had never touched that basket of her own accord before .
Ray 's boat went to Jacky , and Daisy 's doll to his oldest sister , the twins ' lace handkerchiefs to the two smaller girls and the hood to the baby .
Then the stockings were filled up with doughnuts and jelly cookies and the money was put in an envelope and pinned to the little mother 's jacket .
`` That baby is such a dear little fellow , '' said the sealskin lady gently .
`` He looks something like my little son .
He died eighteen Christmases ago . ''
Aunt Cyrilla put her hand over the lady 's kid glove .
`` So did mine , '' she said .
Then the two women smiled tenderly at each other .
Afterwards they rested from their labours and all had what Aunt Cyrilla called a `` snack '' of sandwiches and pound cake .
The khaki boy said he had n't tasted anything half so good since he left home .
`` They did n't give us pound cake in South Africa , '' he said .
When morning came the storm was still raging .
The children wakened and went wild with delight over their stockings .
The little mother found her envelope and tried to utter thanks and broke down ; and nobody knew what to say or do , when the conductor fortunately came in and made a diversion by telling them they might as well resign themselves to spending Christmas on the train .
`` This is serious , '' said the khaki boy , `` when you consider that we 've no provisions .
Do n't mind for myself , used to half rations or no rations at all .
But these kiddies will have tremendous appetites . ''
Then Aunt Cyrilla rose to the occasion .
`` I 've got some emergency rations here , '' she announced .
`` There 's plenty for all and we 'll have our Christmas dinner , although a cold one .
Breakfast first thing .
There 's a sandwich apiece left and we must fill up on what is left of the cookies and doughnuts and save the rest for a real good spread at dinner time .
The only thing is , I have n't any bread . ''
`` I 've a box of soda crackers , '' said the little mother eagerly .
Nobody in that car will ever forget that Christmas .
To begin with , after breakfast they had a concert .
The khaki boy gave two recitations , sang three songs , and gave a whistling solo .
Lucy Rose gave three recitations and the minister a comic reading .
The pale shop girl sang two songs .
It was agreed that the khaki boy 's whistling solo was the best number , and Aunt Cyrilla gave him the bouquet of everlastings as a reward of merit .
Then the conductor came in with the cheerful news that the storm was almost over and he thought the track would be cleared in a few hours .
`` If we can get to the next station we 'll be all right , '' he said .
`` The branch joins the main line there and the tracks will be clear . ''
At noon they had dinner .
The train hands were invited in to share it .
The minister carved the chicken with the brakeman 's jack-knife and the khaki boy cut up the tongue and the mince pies , while the sealskin lady mixed the raspberry vinegar with its due proportion of water .
Bits of paper served as plates .
The train furnished a couple of glasses , a tin pint cup was discovered and given to the children , Aunt Cyrilla and Lucy Rose and the sealskin lady drank , turn about , from the latter 's graduated medicine glass , the shop girl and the little mother shared one of the empty bottles , and the khaki boy , the minister , and the train men drank out of the other bottle .
Everybody declared they had never enjoyed a meal more in their lives .
Certainly it was a merry one , and Aunt Cyrilla 's cooking was never more appreciated ; indeed , the bones of the chicken and the pot of preserves were all that was left .
They could not eat the preserves because they had no spoons , so Aunt Cyrilla gave them to the little mother .
When all was over , a hearty vote of thanks was passed to Aunt Cyrilla and her basket .
The sealskin lady wanted to know how she made her pound cake , and the khaki boy asked for her receipt for jelly cookies .
And when two hours later the conductor came in and said the snowploughs had got along and they 'd soon be starting , they all wondered if it could really be less than twenty-four hours since they met .
`` I feel as if I 'd been campaigning with you all my life , '' said the khaki boy .
At the next station they all parted .
The little mother and the children had to take the next train back home .
The minister stayed there , and the khaki boy and the sealskin lady changed trains .
The sealskin lady shook Aunt Cyrilla 's hand .
She no longer looked discontented or cross .
`` This has been the pleasantest Christmas I have ever spent , '' she said heartily .
`` I shall never forget that wonderful basket of yours .
The little shop girl is going home with me .
I 've promised her a place in my husband 's store . ''
When Aunt Cyrilla and Lucy Rose reached Pembroke there was nobody to meet them because everyone had given up expecting them .
It was not far from the station to Edward 's house and Aunt Cyrilla elected to walk .
`` I 'll carry the basket , '' said Lucy Rose .
Aunt Cyrilla relinquished it with a smile .
Lucy Rose smiled too .
`` It 's a blessed old basket , '' said the latter , `` and I love it .
Please forget all the silly things I ever said about it , Aunt C'rilla . ''
Davenport 's Story It was a rainy afternoon , and we had been passing the time by telling ghost stories .
That is a very good sort of thing for a rainy afternoon , and it is a much better time than after night .
If you tell ghost stories after dark they are apt to make you nervous , whether you own up to it or not , and you sneak home and dodge upstairs in mortal terror , and undress with your back to the wall , so that you ca n't fancy there is anything behind you .
We had each told a story , and had had the usual assortment of mysterious noises and death warnings and sheeted spectres and so on , down through the whole catalogue of horrors -- enough to satisfy any reasonable ghost-taster .
But Jack , as usual , was dissatisfied .
He said our stories were all second-hand stuff .
There was n't a man in the crowd who had ever seen or heard a ghost ; all our so-called authentic stories had been told us by persons who had the story from other persons who saw the ghosts .
`` One does n't get any information from that , '' said Jack .
`` I never expect to get so far along as to see a real ghost myself , but I would like to see and talk to one who had . ''
Some persons appear to have the knack of getting their wishes granted .
Jack is one of that ilk .
Just as he made the remark , Davenport sauntered in and , finding out what was going on , volunteered to tell a ghost story himself -- something that had happened to his grandmother , or maybe it was his great-aunt ; I forget which .
It was a very good ghost story as ghost stories go , and Davenport told it well .
Even Jack admitted that , but he said : `` It 's only second-hand too .
Did you ever have a ghostly experience yourself , old man ? ''
Davenport put his finger tips critically together .
`` Would you believe me if I said I had ? ''
he asked .
`` No , '' said Jack unblushingly .
`` Then there would be no use in my saying it . ''
`` But you do n't mean that you ever really had , of course ? ''
`` I do n't know .
Something queer happened once .
I 've never been able to explain it -- from a practical point of view , that is .
Want to hear about it ? ''
Of course we did .
This was exciting .
Nobody would ever have suspected Davenport of seeing ghosts .
`` It 's conventional enough , '' he began .
`` Ghosts do n't seem to have much originality .
But it 's firsthand , Jack , if that 's what you want .
I do n't suppose any of you have ever heard me speak of my brother , Charles .
He was my senior by two years , and was a quiet , reserved sort of fellow -- not at all demonstrative , but with very strong and deep affections .
`` When he left college he became engaged to Dorothy Chester .
She was very beautiful , and my brother idolized her .
She died a short time before the date set for their marriage , and Charles never recovered from the blow .
`` I married Dorothy 's sister , Virginia .
Virginia did not in the least resemble her sister , but our eldest daughter was strikingly like her dead aunt .
We called her Dorothy , and Charles was devoted to her .
Dolly , as we called her , was always ` Uncle Charley 's girl . '
`` When Dolly was twelve years old Charles went to New Orleans on business , and while there took yellow fever and died .
He was buried there , and Dolly half broke her childish heart over his death .
`` One day , five years later , when Dolly was seventeen , I was writing letters in my library .
That very morning my wife and Dolly had gone to New York en route for Europe .
Dolly was going to school in Paris for a year .
Business prevented my accompanying them even as far as New York , but Gilbert Chester , my wife 's brother , was going with them .
They were to sail on the Aragon the next morning .
`` I had written steadily for about an hour .
At last , growing tired , I threw down my pen and , leaning back in my chair , was on the point of lighting a cigar when an unaccountable impulse made me turn round .
I dropped my cigar and sprang to my feet in amazement .
There was only one door in the room and I had all along been facing it .
I could have sworn nobody had entered , yet there , standing between me and the bookcase , was a man -- and that man was my brother Charles !
`` There was no mistaking him ; I saw him as plainly as I see you .
He was a tall , rather stout man , with curly hair and a fair , close-clipped beard .
He wore the same light-grey suit which he had worn when bidding us good-bye on the morning of his departure for New Orleans .
He had no hat on , but wore spectacles , and was standing in his old favourite attitude , with his hands behind him .
`` I want you to understand that at this precise moment , although I was surprised beyond measure , I was not in the least frightened , because I did not for a moment suppose that what I saw was -- well , a ghost or apparition of any sort .
The thought that flashed across my bewildered brain was simply that there had been some absurd mistake somewhere , and that my brother had never died at all , but was here , alive and well .
I took a hasty step towards him . ''
` Good heavens , old fellow ! '
I exclaimed .
` Where on earth have you come from ?
Why , we all thought you were dead ! '
`` I was quite close to him when I stopped abruptly .
Somehow I could n't move another step .
He made no motion , but his eyes looked straight into mine . ''
` Do not let Dolly sail on the Aragon tomorrow , ' he said in slow , clear tones that I heard distinctly .
`` And then he was gone -- yes , Jack , I know it is a very conventional way of ending up a ghost story , | but I have to tell you just what occurred , or at least what I thought occurred .
One moment he was there and the next moment he was n't .
He did not pass me or go out of the door .
`` For a few moments I felt dazed .
I was wide awake and in my right and proper senses so far as I could judge , and yet the whole thing seemed incredible .
Scared ?
No , I was n't conscious of being scared .
I was simply bewildered .
`` In my mental confusion one thought stood out sharply -- Dolly was in danger of some kind , and if the warning was really from a supernatural source , it must not be disregarded .
I rushed to the station and , having first wired to my wife not to sail on the Aragon , I found that I could connect with the five-fifteen train for New York .
I took it with the comfortable consciousness that my friends would certainly think I had gone out of my mind .
`` I arrived in New York at eight o'clock the next morning and at once drove to the hotel where my wife , daughter and brother-in-law were staying .
I found them greatly mystified by my telegram .
I suppose my explanation was a very lame one .
I know I felt decidedly like a fool .
Gilbert laughed at me and said I had dreamed the whole thing .
Virginia was perplexed , but Dolly accepted the warning unhesitatingly . ''
` Of course it was Uncle Charley , ' she said confidently .
` We will not sail on the Aragon now . '
`` Gilbert had to give in to this decision with a very bad grace , and the Aragon sailed that day minus three of her intended passengers .
`` Well , you 've all heard of the historic collision between the Aragon and the Astarte in a fog , and the fearful loss of life it involved .
Gilbert did n't laugh when the news came , I assure you .
Virginia and Dolly sailed a month later on the Marseilles , and reached the other side in safety .
That 's all the story , boys -- the only experience of the kind I ever had , '' concluded Davenport .
We had many questions to ask and several theories to advance .
Jack said Davenport had dreamed it and that the collision of the Aragon and the Astarte was simply a striking coincidence .
But Davenport merely smiled at all our suggestions and , as it cleared up just about three , we told no more ghost stories .
Emily 's Husband Emily Fair got out of Hiram Jameson 's waggon at the gate .
She took her satchel and parasol and , in her clear , musical tones , thanked him for bringing her home .
Emily had a very distinctive voice .
It was very sweet always and very cold generally ; sometimes it softened to tenderness with those she loved , but in it there was always an undertone of inflexibility and reserve .
Nobody had ever heard Emily Fair 's voice tremble .
`` You are more than welcome , Mrs. Fair , '' said Hiram Jameson , with a glance of bold admiration .
Emily met it with an unflinching indifference .
She disliked Hiram Jameson .
She had been furious under all her external composure because he had been at the station when she left the train .
Jameson perceived her scorn , but chose to disregard it .
`` Proud as Lucifer , '' he thought as he drove away .
`` Well , she 's none the worse of that .
I do n't like your weak women -- they 're always sly .
If Stephen Fair do n't get better she 'll be free and then -- '' He did not round out the thought , but he gloated over the memory of Emily , standing by the gate in the harsh , crude light of the autumn sunset , with her tawny , brown hair curling about her pale , oval face and the scornful glint in her large , dark-grey eyes .
Emily stood at the gate for some time after Jameson 's waggon had disappeared .
When the brief burst of sunset splendour had faded out she turned and went into the garden where late asters and chrysanthemums still bloomed .
She gathered some of the more perfect ones here and there .
She loved flowers , but to-night the asters seemed to hurt her , for she presently dropped those she had gathered and deliberately set her foot on them .
A sudden gust of wind came over the brown , sodden fields and the ragged maples around the garden writhed and wailed .
The air was raw and chill .
The rain that had threatened all day was very near .
Emily shivered and went into the house .
Amelia Phillips was bending over the fire .
She came forward and took Emily 's parcels and wraps with a certain gentleness that sat oddly on her grim personality .
`` Are you tired ?
I 'm glad you 're back .
Did you walk from the station ? ''
`` No .
Hiram Jameson was there and offered to drive me home .
I 'd rather have walked .
It 's going to be a storm , I think .
Where is John ? ''
`` He went to the village after supper , '' answered Amelia , lighting a lamp .
`` We needed some things from the store . ''
The light flared up as she spoke and brought out her strong , almost harsh features and deep-set black eyes .
Amelia Phillips looked like an overdone sketch in charcoal .
`` Has anything happened in Woodford while I 've been away ? ''
asked Emily indifferently .
Plainly she did not expect an affirmative answer .
Woodford life was not eventful .
Amelia glanced at her sharply .
So she had not heard !
Amelia had expected that Hiram Jameson would have told her .
She wished that he had , for she never felt sure of Emily .
The older sister knew that beneath that surface reserve was a passionate nature , brooking no restraint when once it overleaped the bounds of her Puritan self-control .
Amelia Phillips , with all her naturally keen insight and her acquired knowledge of Emily 's character , had never been able to fathom the latter 's attitude of mind towards her husband .
From the time that Emily had come back to her girlhood 's home , five years before , Stephen Fair 's name had never crossed her lips .
`` I suppose you have n't heard that Stephen is very ill , '' said Amelia slowly .
Not a feature of Emily 's face changed .
Only in her voice when she spoke was a curious jarring , as if a false note had been struck in a silver melody .
`` What is the matter with him ? ''
`` Typhoid , '' answered Amelia briefly .
She felt relieved that Emily had taken it so calmly .
Amelia hated Stephen Fair with all the intensity of her nature because she believed that he had treated Emily ill , but she had always been distrustful that Emily in her heart of hearts loved her husband still .
That , in Amelia Phillips ' opinion , would have betrayed a weakness not to be tolerated .
Emily looked at the lamp unwinkingly .
`` That wick needs trimming , '' she said .
Then , with a sudden recurrence of the untuneful note : `` Is he dangerously ill ? ''
`` We have n't heard for three days .
The doctors were not anxious about him Monday , though they said it was a pretty severe case . ''
A faint , wraith-like change of expression drifted over Emily 's beautiful face and was gone in a moment .
What was it -- relief ?
Regret ?
It would have been impossible to say .
When she next spoke her vibrant voice was as perfectly melodious as usual .
`` I think I will go to bed , Amelia .
John will not be back until late I suppose , and I am very tired .
There comes the rain .
I suppose it will spoil all the flowers .
They will be beaten to pieces . ''
In the dark hall Emily paused for a moment and opened the front door to be cut in the face with a whip-like dash of rain .
She peered out into the thickly gathering gloom .
Beyond , in the garden , she saw the asters tossed about , phantom-like .
The wind around the many-cornered old farmhouse was full of wails and sobs .
The clock in the sitting-room struck eight .
Emily shivered and shut the door .
She remembered that she had been married at eight o'clock that very morning seven years ago .
She thought she could see herself coming down the stairs in her white dress with her bouquet of asters .
For a moment she was glad that those mocking flowers in the garden would be all beaten to death before morning by the lash of wind and rain .
Then she recovered her mental poise and put the hateful memories away from her as she went steadily up the narrow stairs and along the hall with its curious slant as the house had settled , to her own room under the north-western eaves .
When she had put out her light and gone to bed she found that she could not sleep .
She pretended to believe that it was the noise of the storm that kept her awake .
Not even to herself would Emily confess that she was waiting and listening nervously for John 's return home .
That would have been to admit a weakness , and Emily Fair , like Amelia , despised weakness .
Every few minutes a gust of wind smote the house , with a roar as of a wild beast , and bombarded Emily 's window with a volley of rattling drops .
In the silences that came between the gusts she heard the soft , steady pouring of the rain on the garden paths below , mingled with a faint murmur that came up from the creek beyond the barns where the pine boughs were thrashing in the storm .
Emily suddenly thought of a weird story she had once read years before and long forgotten -- a story of a soul that went out in a night of storm and blackness and lost its way between earth and heaven .
She shuddered and drew the counterpane over her face .
`` Of all things I hate a fall storm most , '' she muttered .
`` It frightens me . ''
Somewhat to her surprise -- for even her thoughts were generally well under the control of her unbending will -- she could not help thinking of Stephen -- thinking of him not tenderly or remorsefully , but impersonally , as of a man who counted for nothing in her life .
It was so strange to think of Stephen being ill .
She had never known him to have a day 's sickness in his life before .
She looked back over her life much as if she were glancing with a chill interest at a series of pictures which in no way concerned her .
Scene after scene , face after face , flashed out on the background of the darkness .
Emily 's mother had died at her birth , but Amelia Phillips , twenty years older than the baby sister , had filled the vacant place so well and with such intuitive tenderness that Emily had never been conscious of missing a mother .
John Phillips , too , the grave , silent , elder brother , loved and petted the child .
Woodford people were fond of saying that John and Amelia spoiled Emily shamefully .
Emily Phillips had never been like the other Woodford girls and had no friends of her own age among them .
Her uncommon beauty won her many lovers , but she had never cared for any of them until Stephen Fair , fifteen years her senior , had come a-wooing to the old , gray , willow-girdled Phillips homestead .
Amelia and John Phillips never liked him .
There was an ancient feud between the families that had died out among the younger generation , but was still potent with the older .
From the first Emily had loved Stephen .
Indeed , deep down in her strange , wayward heart , she had cared for him long before the memorable day when he had first looked at her with seeing eyes and realized that the quiet , unthought-of child who had been growing up at the old Phillips place had blossomed out into a woman of strange , seraph-like beauty and deep grey eyes whose expression was nevermore to go out of Stephen Fair 's remembrance from then till the day of his death .
John and Amelia Phillips put their own unjustifiable dislike of Stephen aside when they found that Emily 's heart was set on him .
The two were married after a brief courtship and Emily went out from her girlhood 's home to the Fair homestead , two miles away .
Stephen 's mother lived with them .
Janet Fair had never liked Emily .
She had not been willing for Stephen to marry her .
But , apart from this , the woman had a natural , ineradicable love of making mischief and took a keen pleasure in it .
She loved her son and she had loved her husband , but nevertheless , when Thomas Fair had been alive she had fomented continual strife and discontent between him and Stephen .
Now it became her pleasure to make what trouble she could between Stephen and his wife .
She had the advantage of Emily in that she was always sweet-spoken and , on the surface , sweet-tempered .
Emily , hurt and galled in a score of petty ways , so subtle that they were beyond a man 's courser comprehension , astonished her husband by her fierce outbursts of anger that seemed to him for the most part without reason or excuse .
He tried his best to preserve the peace between his wife and mother ; and when he failed , not understanding all that Emily really endured at the elder woman 's merciless hands , he grew to think her capricious and easily irritated -- a spoiled child whose whims must not be taken too seriously .
To a certain extent he was right .
Emily had been spoiled .
The unbroken indulgence which her brother and sister had always accorded her had fitted her but poorly to cope with the trials of her new life .
True , Mrs. Fair was an unpleasant woman to live with , but if Emily had chosen to be more patient under petty insults , and less resentful of her husband 's well-meant though clumsy efforts for harmony , the older woman could have effected real little mischief .
But this Emily refused to be , and the breach between husband and wife widened insidiously .
The final rupture came two years after their marriage .
Emily , in rebellious anger , told her husband that she would no longer live in the same house with his mother .
`` You must choose between us , '' she said , her splendid voice vibrating with all the unleashed emotion of her being , yet with no faltering in it .
`` If she stays I go . ''
Stephen Fair , harassed and bewildered , was angry with the relentless anger of a patient man roused at last .
`` Go , then , '' he said sternly , `` I 'll never turn my mother from my door for any woman 's whim . ''
The stormy red went out of Emily 's face , leaving it like a marble wash .
`` You mean that ! ''
she said calmly .
`` Think well .
If I go I 'll never return . ''
`` I do mean it , '' said Stephen .
`` Leave my house if you will -- if you hold your marriage vow so lightly .
When your senses return you are welcome to come back to me .
I will never ask you to . ''
Without another word Emily turned away .
That night she went back to John and Amelia .
They , on their part , welcomed her back gladly , believing her to be a wronged and ill-used woman .
They hated Stephen Fair with a new and personal rancour .
The one thing they could hardly have forgiven Emily would have been the fact of her relenting towards him .
But she did not relent .
In her soul she knew that , with all her just grievances , she had been in the wrong , and for that she could not forgive him !
Two years after she had left Stephen Mrs. Fair died , and his widowed sister-in-law went to keep house for him .
If he thought of Emily he made no sign .
Stephen Fair never broke a word once passed .
Since their separation no greeting or look had ever passed between husband and wife .
When they met , as they occasionally did , neither impassive face changed .
Emily Fair had buried her love deeply .
In her pride and anger she would not let herself remember even where she had dug its grave .
And now Stephen was ill .
The strange woman felt a certain pride in her own inflexibility because the fact did not affect her .
She told herself that she could not have felt more unconcerned had he been the merest stranger .
Nevertheless she waited and watched for John Phillips ' homecoming .
At ten o'clock she heard his voice in the kitchen .
She leaned out of the bed and pulled open her door .
She heard voices below , but could not distinguish the words , so she rose and went noiselessly out into the hall , knelt down by the stair railing and listened .
The door of the kitchen was open below her and a narrow shaft of light struck on her white , intent face .
She looked like a woman waiting for the decree of doom .
At first John and Amelia talked of trivial matters .
Then the latter said abruptly : `` Did you hear how Stephen Fair was ? ''
`` He 's dying , '' was the brief response .
Emily heard Amelia 's startled exclamation .
She gripped the square rails with her hands until the sharp edges dinted deep into her fingers .
John 's voice came up to her again , harsh and expressionless : `` He took a bad turn the day before yesterday and has been getting worse ever since .
The doctors do n't expect him to live till morning . ''
Amelia began to talk rapidly in low tones .
Emily heard nothing further .
She got up and went blindly back into her room with such agony tearing at her heartstrings that she dully wondered why she could not shriek aloud .
Stephen -- her husband -- dying !
In the burning anguish of that moment her own soul was as an open book before her .
The love she had buried rose from the deeps of her being in an awful , accusing resurrection .
Out of her stupor and pain a purpose formed itself clearly .
She must go to Stephen -- she must beg and win his forgiveness before it was too late .
She dared not go down to John and ask him to take her to her husband .
He might refuse .
The Phillipses had been known to do even harder things than that .
At the best there would be a storm of protest and objection on her brother 's and sister 's part , and Emily felt that she could not encounter that in her present mood .
It would drive her mad .
She lit a lamp and dressed herself noiselessly , but with feverish haste .
Then she listened .
The house was very still .
Amelia and John had gone to bed .
She wrapped herself in a heavy woollen shawl hanging in the hall and crept downstairs .
With numbed fingers she fumbled at the key of the hall door , turned it and slipped out into the night .
The storm seemed to reach out and clutch her and swallow her up .
She went through the garden , where the flowers already were crushed to earth ; she crossed the long field beyond , where the rain cut her face like a whip and the wind almost twisted her in its grasp like a broken reed .
Somehow or other , more by blind instinct than anything else , she found the path that led through commons and woods and waste valleys to her lost home .
In after years that frenzied walk through the storm and blackness seemed as an unbroken nightmare to Emily Fair 's recollection .
Often she fell .
Once as she did so a jagged , dead limb of fir struck her forehead and cut in it a gash that marked her for life .
As she struggled to her feet and found her way again the blood trickled down over her face .
`` Oh God , do n't let him die before I get to him -- do n't -- do n't -- do n't ! ''
she prayed desperately with more of defiance than entreaty in her voice .
Then , realizing this , she cried out in horror .
Surely some fearsome punishment would come upon her for her wickedness -- she would find her husband lying dead .
When Emily opened the kitchen door of the Fair homestead Almira Sentner cried out in her alarm , who or what was this creature with the white face and wild eyes , with her torn and dripping garments and dishevelled , wind-writhen hair and the big drops of blood slowly trickling from her brow ?
The next moment she recognized Emily and her face hardened .
This woman , Stephen 's sister-in-law , had always hated Emily Fair .
`` What do you want here ? ''
she said harshly .
`` Where is my husband ? ''
asked Emily .
`` You ca n't see him , '' said Mrs. Sentner defiantly .
`` The doctors wo n't allow anyone in the room but those he 's used to .
Strangers excite him . ''
The insolence and cruelty of her speech fell on unheeding ears .
Emily , understanding only that her husband yet lived , turned to the hall door .
`` Stand back ! ''
she said in a voice that was little more than a thrilling whisper , but which yet had in it something that cowed Almira Sentner 's malice .
Sullenly she stood aside and Emily went unhindered up the stairs to the room where the sick man lay .
The two doctors in attendance were there , together with the trained nurse from the city .
Emily pushed them aside and fell on her knees by the bed .
One of the doctors made a hasty motion as if to draw her back , but the other checked him .
`` It does n't matter now , '' he said significantly .
Stephen Fair turned his languid , unshorn head on the pillow .
His dull , fevered eyes met Emily 's .
He had not recognized anyone all day , but he knew his wife .
`` Emily ! ''
he whispered .
Emily drew his head close to her face and kissed his lips passionately .
`` Stephen , I 've come back to you .
Forgive me -- forgive me -- say that you forgive me . ''
`` It 's all right , my girl , '' he said feebly .
She buried her face in the pillow beside his with a sob .
In the wan , grey light of the autumn dawn the old doctor came to the bedside and lifted Emily to her feet .
She had not stirred the whole night .
Now she raised her white face with dumb pleading in her eyes .
The doctor glanced at the sleeping form on the bed .
`` Your husband will live , Mrs. Fair , '' he said gently .
`` I think your coming saved him .
His joy turned the ebbing tide in favour of life . ''
`` Thank God ! ''
said Emily .
And for the first time in her life her beautiful voice trembled .
Min The morning sun hung , a red , lustreless ball , in the dull grey sky .
A light snow had fallen in the night and the landscape , crossed by spider-like trails of fences , was as white and lifeless as if wrapped in a shroud .
A young man was driving down the road to Rykman 's Corner ; the youthful face visible above the greatcoat was thoughtful and refined , the eyes deep blue and peculiarly beautiful , the mouth firm yet sensitive .
It was not a handsome face , but there was a strangely subtle charm about it .
The chill breathlessness of the air seemed prophetic of more snow .
The Reverend Allan Telford looked across the bare wastes and cold white hills and shivered , as if the icy lifelessness about him were slowly and relentlessly creeping into his own heart and life .
He felt utterly discouraged .
In his soul he was asking bitterly what good had come of all his prayerful labours among the people of this pinched , narrow world , as rugged and unbeautiful in form and life as the barren hills that shut them in .
He had been two years among them and he counted it two years of failure .
He had been too outspoken for them ; they resented sullenly his direct and incisive tirades against their pet sins .
They viewed his small innovations on their traditional ways of worship with disfavour and distrust and shut him out of their lives with an ever-increasing coldness .
He had meant well and worked hard and he felt his failure keenly .
His thoughts reverted to a letter received the preceding day from a former classmate , stating that the pastorate of a certain desirable town church had become vacant and hinting that a call was to be moderated for him unless he signified his unwillingness to accept .
Two years before , Allan Telford , fresh from college and full of vigorous enthusiasm and high ideas , would have said : `` No , that is not for me .
My work must lie among the poor and lowly of earth as did my Master 's .
Shall I shrink from it because , to worldly eyes , the way looks dreary and uninviting ? ''
Now , looking back on his two years ' ministry , he said wearily : `` I can remain here no longer .
If I do , I fear I shall sink down into something almost as pitiful as one of these canting , gossiping people myself .
I can do them no good -- they do not like or trust me .
I will accept this call and go back to my own world . ''
Perhaps the keynote of his failure was sounded in his last words , `` my own world . ''
He had never felt , or tried to feel , that this narrow sphere was his own world .
It was some lower level to which he had come with good tidings and honest intentions but , unconsciously , he had held himself above it , and his people felt and resented this .
They expressed it by saying he was `` stuck-up . ''
Rykman 's Corner came into view as he drove over the brow of a long hill .
He hated the place , knowing it well for what it was -- a festering hotbed of gossip and malice , the habitat of all the slanderous rumours and innuendoes that permeated the social tissue of the community .
The newest scandal , the worst-flavoured joke , the latest details of the most recent quarrel , were always to be had at Rykman 's store .
As the minister drove down the hill , a man came out of a small house at the foot and waited on the road .
Had it been possible Telford would have pretended not to see him , but it was not possible , for Isaac Galletly meant to be seen and hailed the minister cheerfully .
`` Good mornin ' , Mr. Telford .
Ye wo n't mind giving me a lift down to the Corner , I dessay ? ''
Telford checked his horse reluctantly and Galletly crawled into the cutter .
He was that most despicable of created beings , a male gossip , and he spent most of his time travelling from house to house in the village , smoking his pipe in neighbourly kitchens and fanning into an active blaze all the smouldering feuds of the place .
He had been nicknamed `` The Morning Chronicle '' by a sarcastic schoolteacher who had sojourned a winter at the Corner .
The name was an apt one and clung .
Telford had heard it .
I suppose he is starting out on his rounds now , he thought .
Galletly plunged undauntedly into the conversational gap .
`` Quite a fall of snow last night .
Reckon we 'll have more ` fore long .
That was a grand sermon ye gave us last Sunday , Mr. Telford .
Reckon it went home to some folks , judgin ' from all I 've heard .
It was needed and that 's a fact .
` Live peaceably with all men ' -- that 's what I lay out to do .
There ai n't a house in the district but what I can drop into and welcome .
` Tai n't everybody in Rykman 's Corner can say the same . ''
Galletly squinted out of the corner of his eye to see if the minister would open on the trail of this hint .
Telford 's passive face was discouraging but Galletly was not to be baffled .
`` I s ` pose ye have n't heard about the row down at Palmers ' last night ? ''
`` No . ''
The monosyllable was curt .
Telford was vainly seeking to nip Galletly 's gossip in the bud .
The name of Palmer conveyed no especial meaning to his ear .
He knew where the Palmer homestead was , and that the plaintive-faced , fair-haired woman , whose name was Mrs. Fuller and who came to church occasionally , lived there .
His knowledge went no further .
He had called three times and found nobody at home -- at least , to all appearances .
Now he was fated to have the whole budget of some vulgar quarrel forced on him by Galletly .
`` No ?
Everyone 's talkin ' of it .
The long and short of it is that Min Palmer has had a regular up-and-down row with Rose Fuller and turned her and her little gal out of doors .
I believe the two women had an awful time .
Min 's a Tartar when her temper 's up -- and that 's pretty often .
Nobody knows how Rose managed to put up with her so long .
But she has had to go at last .
Goodness knows what the poor critter 'll do .
She has n't a cent nor a relation -- she was just an orphan girl that Palmer brought up .
She is at Rawlingses now .
Maybe when Min cools off , she 'll let her go back but it 's doubtful .
Min hates her like p ` isen . ''
To Telford this was all very unintelligible .
But he understood that Mrs. Fuller was in trouble of some kind and that it was his duty to help her if possible , although he had an odd and unaccountable aversion to the woman , for which he had often reproached himself .
`` Who is this woman you call Min Palmer ? ''
he said coldly .
`` What are the family circumstances ?
I ought to know , perhaps , if I am to be of any service -- but I have no wish to hear idle gossip . ''
His concluding sentence was quite unheeded by Galletly .
`` Min Palmer 's the worst woman in Rykman 's Corner -- or out of it .
She always was an odd one .
I mind her when she was a girl -- a saucy , black-eyed baggage she was !
Handsome , some folks called her .
I never c 'd see it .
Her people were a queer crowd and Min was never brung up right -- jest let run wild all her life .
Well , Rod Palmer took to dancin ' attendance on her .
Rod was a worthless scamp .
Old Palmer was well off and Rod was his only child , but this Rose lived there and kept house for them after Mis ' Palmer died .
She was a quiet , well-behaved little creetur .
Folks said the old man wanted Rod to marry her -- dunno if 't was so or not .
In the end , howsomever , he had to marry Min .
Her brother got after him with a horse-whip , ye understand .
Old Palmer was furious but he had to give in and Rod brought her home .
She was a bit sobered down by her trouble and lived quiet and sullen-like at first .
Her and Rod fought like cat and dog .
Rose married Osh Fuller , a worthless , drunken fellow .
He died in a year or so and left Rose and her baby without a roof over their heads .
Then old Palmer went and brought her home .
He set great store by Rose and he c ` d n't bear Min .
Min had to be civil to Rose as long as old Palmer lived .
Fin ` lly Rod up and died and 't was n't long before his father went too .
Then the queer part came in .
Everyone expected that he 'd purvide well for Rose and Min 'd come in second best .
But no will was to be found .
I do n't say but what it was all right , mind you .
I may have my own secret opinion , of course .
Old Palmer had a regular mania , as ye might say , for makin ' wills .
He 'd have a lawyer out from town every year and have a new will made and the old one burnt .
Lawyer Bell was there and made one ` bout eight months ` fore he died .
It was s ` posed he 'd destroyed it and then died ` fore he 'd time to make another .
He went off awful sudden .
Anyway , everything went to Min 's child -- to Min as ye might say .
She 's been boss .
Rose still stayed on there and Min let her , which was more than folks expected of her .
But she 's turned her out at last .
Min 's in one of her tantrums now and ` tai n't safe to cross her path . ''
`` What is Mrs. Fuller to do ? ''
asked Telford anxiously .
`` That 's the question .
She 's sickly -- ca n't work much -- and then she has her leetle gal .
Min was always jealous of that child .
It 's a real purty , smart leetle creetur and old Palmer made a lot of it .
Min 's own is an awful-looking thing -- a cripple from the time 't was born .
There 's no doubt 't was a jedgement on her .
As for Rose , no doubt the god of the widow and fatherless will purvide for her . ''
In spite of his disgust , Telford could not repress a smile at the tone , half-whine , half-snuffle , with which Galletly ended up .
`` I think I had better call and see this Mrs. Palmer , '' he said slowly . ''
` Twould be no airthly use , Mr. Telford .
Min 'd slam the door in your face if she did nothing worse .
She hates ministers and everything that 's good .
She has n't darkened a church door for years .
She never had any religious tendency to begin with , and when there was such a scandal about her , old Mr. Dinwoodie , our pastor then -- a godly man , Mr. Telford -- he did n't hold no truck with evildoers -- he went right to her to reprove and rebuke her for her sins .
Min , she flew at him .
She vowed then she 'd never go to church again , and she never has .
People hereabouts has talked to her and tried to do her good , but it ai n't no use .
Why , I 've heard that woman say there was no God .
It 's a fact , Mr. Telford -- I have .
Some of our ministers has tried to visit her .
They did n't try it more than once .
The last one -- he was about your heft -- he got a scare , I tell you .
Min just caught him by the shoulder and shook him like a rat !
Did n't see it myself but Mrs. Rawlings did .
Ye ought to hear her describin ' of it . ''
Galletly chuckled over the recollection , his wicked little eyes glistening with delight .
Telford was thankful when they reached the store .
He felt that he could not endure this man 's society any longer .
Nevertheless , he felt strangely interested .
This Min Palmer must at least be different from the rest of the Cornerites , if only in the greater force of her wickedness .
He almost felt as if her sins on the grand scale were less blameworthy than the petty vices of her censorious neighbours .
Galletly eagerly joined the group of loungers on the dirty wet platform , and Telford passed into the store .
A couple of slatternly women were talking to Mrs. Rykman about `` the Palmer row . ''
Telford made his small purchases hastily .
As he turned from the counter , he came face to face with a woman who had paused in the doorway to survey the scene with an air of sullen scorn .
By some subtle intuition Telford knew that this was Min Palmer .
The young man 's first feeling was one of admiration for the woman before him , who , in spite of her grotesque attire and defiant , unwomanly air , was strikingly beautiful .
She was tall , and not even the man 's ragged overcoat which she wore could conceal the grace of her figure .
Her abundant black hair was twisted into a sagging knot at her neck , and from beneath the old fur cap looked out a pair of large and brilliant black eyes , heavily lashed , and full of a smouldering fire .
Her skin was tanned and coarsened , but the warm crimson blood glowed in her cheeks with a dusky richness , and her face was a perfect oval , with features chiselled in almost classic regularity of outline .
Telford had a curious experience at that moment .
He seemed to see , looking out from behind this external mask of degraded beauty , the semblance of what this woman might have been under more favouring circumstance of birth and environment , wherein her rich , passionate nature , potent for either good or evil , might have been trained and swayed aright until it had developed grandly out into the glorious womanhood the Creator must have planned for her .
He knew , as if by revelation , that this woman had nothing in common with the narrow , self-righteous souls of Rykman 's Corner .
Warped and perverted though her nature might be , she was yet far nobler than those who sat in judgement upon her .
Min made some scanty purchases and left the store quickly , brushing unheedingly past the minister as she did so .
He saw her step on a rough wood-sleigh and drive down the river road .
The platform loungers had been silent during her call , but now the talk bubbled forth anew .
Telford was sick at heart as he drove swiftly away .
He felt for Min Palmer a pity he could not understand or analyze .
The attempt to measure the gulf between what she was and what she might have been hurt him like the stab of a knife .
He made several calls at various houses along the river during the forenoon .
After dinner he suddenly turned his horse towards the Palmer place .
Isaac Galletly , comfortably curled up in a neighbour 's chimney corner , saw him drive past .
`` Ef the minister ai n't goin ' to Palmers ' after all ! ''
he chuckled .
`` He 's a set one when he does take a notion .
Well , I warned him what to expect .
If Min claws his eyes out , he 'll only have himself to blame . ''
Telford was not without his own misgivings as he drove into the Palmer yard .
He tied his horse to the fence and looked doubtfully about him .
Untrodden snowdrifts were heaped about the front door , so he turned towards the kitchen and walked slowly past the bare lilac trees along the fence .
There was no sign of life about the place .
It was beginning to snow again , softly and thickly , and the hills and river were hidden behind a misty white veil .
He lifted his hand to knock , but before he could do so , the door was flung open and Min herself confronted him on the threshold .
She did not now have on the man 's overcoat which she had worn at the store , and her neat , close-fitting home-spun dress revealed to perfection the full , magnificent curves of her figure .
Her splendid hair was braided about her head in a glossy coronet , and her dark eyes were ablaze with ill-suppressed anger .
Again Telford was overcome by a sense of her wonderful loveliness .
Not all the years of bondage to ill-temper and misguided will had been able to blot out the beauty of that proud , dark face .
She lifted one large but shapely brown hand and pointed to the gate .
`` Go ! ''
she said threateningly .
`` Mrs. Palmer , '' began Telford , but she silenced him with an imperious gesture .
`` I do n't want any of your kind here .
I hate all you ministers .
Did you come here to lecture me ?
I suppose some of the Corner saints set you on me .
You 'll never cross my threshold . ''
Telford returned her defiant gaze unflinchingly .
His dark-blue eyes , magnetic in their power and sweetness , looked gravely , questioningly , into Min 's stormy orbs .
Slowly the fire and anger faded out of her face and her head drooped .
`` I ai n't fit for you to talk to anyway , '' she said with a sort of sullen humility .
`` Maybe you mean well but you ca n't do me any good .
I 'm past that now .
The Corner saints say I 'm possessed of the devil .
Perhaps I am -- if there is one . ''
`` I do mean well , '' said Telford slowly .
`` I did not come here to reprove you .
I came to help you if I could -- if you needed help , Mrs. Palmer -- '' `` Do n't call me that , '' she interrupted passionately .
She flung out her hands as if pushing some loathly , invisible thing from her .
`` I hate the name -- as I hated all who ever bore it .
I never had anything but wrong and dog-usage from them all .
Call me Min -- that 's the only name that belongs to me now .
Go -- why do n't you go ?
Do n't stand there looking at me like that .
I 'm not going to change my mind .
I do n't want any praying and whining round me .
I 've been well sickened of that .
Go ! ''
Telford threw back his head and looked once more into her eyes .
A long look passed between them .
Then he silently lifted his cap and , with no word of farewell , he turned and went down to the gate .
A bitter sense of defeat and disappointment filled his heart as he drove away .
Min stood in the doorway and watched the sleigh out of sight down the river road .
Then she gave a long , shivering sigh that was almost a moan .
`` If I had met that man long ago , '' she said slowly , as if groping vaguely in some hitherto unsounded depth of consciousness , `` I would never have become what I am .
I felt that as I looked at him -- it all came over me with an awful sickening feeling -- just as if we were standing alone somewhere out of the world where there was no need of words to say things .
He does n't despise me -- he would n't sneer at me , bad as I am , like those creatures up there .
He could have helped me if we had met in time , but it 's too late now . ''
She locked her hands over her eyes and groaned , swaying her body to and fro as one in mortal agony .
Presently she looked out again with hard , dry eyes .
`` What a fool I am ! ''
she said bitterly .
`` How the Corner saints would stare if they saw me !
I suppose some of them do -- '' with a glance at the windows of a neighbouring house .
`` Yes , there 's Mrs. Rawlings staring out and Rose peeking over her shoulder . ''
Her face hardened .
The old sway of evil passion reasserted itself .
`` She shall never come back here -- never .
Oh , she was a sweet-spoken cat of a thing -- but she had claws .
I 've been blamed for all the trouble .
But if ever I had a chance , I 'd tell that minister how she used to twit and taunt me in that sugary way of hers -- how she schemed and plotted against me as long as she could .
More fool I to care what he thinks either !
I wish I were dead .
If 't was n't for the child , I 'd go and drown myself at that black spring-hole down there -- I 'd be well out of the way . ''
* * * * * It was a dull grey afternoon a week afterwards when Allan Telford again walked up the river road to the Palmer place .
The wind was bitter and he walked with bent head to avoid its fury .
His face was pale and worn and he looked years older .
He paused at the rough gate and leaned over it while he scanned the house and its surroundings eagerly .
As he looked , the kitchen door opened and Min , clad in the old overcoat , came out and walked swiftly across the yard .
Telford 's eyes followed her with pitiful absorption .
He saw her lead a horse from the stable and harness it into a wood-sleigh loaded with bags of grain .
Once she paused to fling her arms about the animal 's neck , laying her face against it with a caressing motion .
The pale minister groaned aloud .
He longed to snatch her forever from that hard , unwomanly toil and fold her safely away from jeers and scorn in the shelter of his love .
He knew it was madness -- he had told himself so every hour in which Min 's dark , rebellious face had haunted him -- yet none the less was he under its control .
Min led the horse across the yard and left it standing before the kitchen door ; she had not seen the bowed figure at the gate .
When she reappeared , he saw her dark eyes and the rose-red lustre of her face gleam out from under the old crimson shawl wrapped about her head .
As she caught the horse by the bridle , the kitchen door swung heavily to with a sharp , sudden bang .
The horse , a great , powerful , nervous brute , started wildly and then reared in terror .
The ice underfoot was glib and treacherous .
Min lost her foothold and fell directly under the horse 's hoofs as they came heavily down .
The animal , freed from her detaining hand , sprang forward , dragging the laden sleigh over the prostrate woman .
It had all passed in a moment .
The moveless figure lay where it had fallen , one outstretched hand still grasping the whip .
Telford sprang over the gate and rushed up the slope like a madman .
He flung himself on his knees beside her .
`` Min !
Min ! ''
he called wildly .
There was no answer .
He lifted her in his arms and staggered into the house with his burden , his heart stilling with a horrible fear as he laid her gently down on the old lounge in one corner of the kitchen .
The room was a large one and everything was neat and clean .
The fire burned brightly , and a few green plants were in blossom by the south window .
Beside them sat a child of about seven years who turned a startled face at Telford 's reckless entrance .
The boy had Min 's dark eyes and perfectly chiselled features , refined by suffering into cameo-like delicacy , and the silken hair fell in soft , waving masses about the spiritual little face .
By his side nestled a tiny dog , with satin ears and paws fringed as with ravelled silk .
Telford paid heed to nothing , not even the frightened child .
He was as one distraught .
`` Min , '' he wailed again , striving tremblingly to feel her pulse while cold drops came out on his forehead .
Min 's face was as pallid as marble , save for one heavy bruise across the cheek and a cruel cut at the edge of the dark hair , from which the blood trickled down on the pillow .
She opened her eyes wonderingly at his call , looking up with a dazed , appealing expression of pain and dread .
A low moan broke from her white lips .
Telford sprang to his feet in a tumult of quivering joy .
`` Min , dear , '' he said gently , `` you have been hurt -- not seriously , I hope .
I must leave you for a minute while I run for help -- I will not be long . ''
`` Come back , '' said Min in a low but distinct tone .
He paused impatiently .
`` It is of no use to get help , '' Min went on calmly .
`` I 'm dying -- I know it .
Oh , my God ! ''
She pressed her hand to her side and writhed .
Telford turned desperately to the door .
Min raised her arm .
`` Come here , '' she said resolutely .
He obeyed mutely .
She looked up at him with bright , unquailing eyes .
`` Do n't you go one step -- do n't leave me here to die alone .
I 'm past help -- and I 've something to say to you .
I must say it and I have n't much time . ''
Telford hardly heeded her in his misery .
`` Min , let me go for help -- let me do something , '' he implored .
`` You must not die -- you must not ! ''
Min had fallen back , gasping , on the blood-stained pillow .
He knelt beside her and put his arm about the poor , crushed body .
`` I must hurry , '' she said faintly .
`` I ca n't die with it on my mind .
Rose -- it 's all hers -- all .
There was a will -- he made it -- old Gra n'ther Palmer .
He always hated me .
I found it before he died -- and read it .
He left everything to her -- not a cent to me nor his son 's child -- we were to starve -- beg .
I was like a madwoman .
When he died -- I hid the will .
I meant -- to burn it -- but I never could .
It 's tortured me -- night and day -- I 've had no peace .
You 'll find it in a box -- in my room .
Tell her -- tell Rose -- how wicked I 've been .
And my boy -- what will become of him ?
Rose hates him -- she 'll turn him out -- or ill-treat him -- '' Telford lifted his white , drawn face .
`` I will take your child , Min .
He shall be to me as my own son . ''
An expression of unspeakable relief came into the dying woman 's face .
`` It is good -- of you .
I can die -- in peace -- now .
I 'm glad to die -- to get clear of it all .
I 'm tired -- of living so .
Perhaps -- I 'll have a chance -- somewhere else .
I 've never -- had any -- here . ''
The dark eyes drooped -- closed .
Telford moaned shudderingly .
Once again Min opened her eyes and looked straight into his .
`` If I had met you -- long ago -- you would have -- loved me -- and I would have been -- a good woman .
It is well for us -- for you -- that I am -- dying .
Your path will be clear -- you will be good and successful -- but you will always -- remember me . ''
Telford bent and pressed his lips to Min 's pain-blanched mouth .
`` Do you think -- we will -- ever meet again ? ''
she said faintly .
`` Out there -- it 's so dark -- God can never -- forgive me -- I 've been so -- wicked . ''
`` Min , the all-loving Father is more merciful than man .
He will forgive you , if you ask Him , and you will wait for me till I come .
I will stay here and do my duty -- I will try hard -- '' His voice broke .
Min 's great black eyes beamed out on him with passionate tenderness .
The strong , deep , erring nature yielded at last .
An exceeding bitter cry rose to her lips .
`` Oh , God -- forgive me -- forgive me ! ''
And with the cry , the soul of poor suffering , sinning , sinned-against Min Palmer fled -- who shall say whither ?
Who shall say that her remorseful cry was not heard , even at that late hour , by a Judge more merciful than her fellow creatures ?
Telford still knelt on the bare floor , holding in his arms the dead form of the woman he loved -- his , all his , in death , as she could never have been in life .
Death had bridged the gulf between them .
The room was very silent .
To Min 's face had returned something of its girlhood 's innocence .
The hard , unlovely lines were all smoothed out .
The little cripple crept timidly up to Telford , with the silky head of the dog pressed against his cheek .
Telford gathered the distorted little body to his side and looked earnestly into the small face -- Min 's face , purified and spiritualized .
He would have it near him always .
He bent and reverently kissed the cold face , the closed eyelids and the blood-stained brow of the dead woman .
Then he stood up .
`` Come with me , dear , '' he said gently to the child .
* * * * * The day after the funeral , Allan Telford sat in the study of his little manse among the encircling wintry hills .
Close to the window sat Min 's child , his small , beautiful face pressed against the panes , and the bright-eyed dog beside him .
Telford was writing in his journal .
`` I shall stay here -- close to her grave .
I shall see it every time I look from my study window -- every time I stand in my pulpit -- every time I go in and out among my people .
I begin to see wherein I have failed .
I shall begin again patiently and humbly .
I wrote today to decline the C -- church call .
My heart and my work are here . ''
He closed the book and bowed his head on it .
Outside the snow fell softly ; he knew that it was wrapping that new-made grave on the cold , fir-sentinelled hillside with a stainless shroud of infinite purity and peace .
Miss Cordelia 's Accommodation `` Poor little creatures ! ''
said Miss Cordelia compassionately .
She meant the factory children .
In her car ride from the school where she taught to the bridge that spanned the river between Pottstown , the sooty little manufacturing village on one side , and Point Pleasant , which was merely a hamlet , on the other , she had seen dozens of them , playing and quarrelling on the streets or peering wistfully out of dingy tenement windows .
`` Tomorrow is Saturday , '' she reflected , `` and they 've no better place to play in than the back streets and yards .
It 's a shame .
There 's work for our philanthropists here , but they do n't seem to see it .
Well , I 'm so sorry for them it hurts me to look at them , but I ca n't do anything . ''
Miss Cordelia sighed and then brightened up , because she realized that she was turning her back upon Pottstown for two blissful days and going to Point Pleasant , which had just one straggling , elm-shaded street hedging on old-fashioned gardens and cosy little houses and trailing off into the real country in a half-hour 's walk .
Miss Cordelia lived alone in a tiny house at Point Pleasant .
It was so tiny that you would have wondered how anyone could live in it .
`` But it 's plenty big for a little old maid like me , '' Miss Cordelia would have told you .
`` And it 's my own -- I 'm queen there .
There 's solid comfort in having one spot for your own self .
To be sure , if I had less land and more house it would be better . ''
Miss Cordelia always laughed here .
It was one of her jokes .
There was a four-acre field behind the house .
Both had been left to her by an uncle .
The field was of no use to Miss Cordelia ; she did n't keep a cow and she had n't time to make a garden .
But she liked her field ; when people asked her why she did n't sell it she said : `` I 'm fond of it .
I like to walk around in it when the grass grows long .
And it may come in handy some time .
Mother used to say if you kept anything seven years it would come to use .
I 've had my field a good bit longer than that , but maybe the time will come yet .
Meanwhile I rejoice in the fact that I am a landed proprietor to the extent of four acres . ''
Miss Cordelia had thought of converting her field into a playground for the factory children and asking detachments of them over on Saturday afternoon .
But she knew that her Point Pleasant neighbours would object to this , so that project was dropped .
When Miss Cordelia pushed open her little gate , hung crookedly in a very compact and prim spruce hedge , she stopped in amazement and said , `` Well , for pity 's sake ! ''
Cynthia Ann Flemming , who lived on the other side of the spruce hedge , now came hurrying over .
`` Good evening , Cordelia .
I have a letter that was left with me for you . ''
`` But -- that -- horse , '' said Miss Cordelia , with a long breath between every word .
`` Where did he come from ?
Tied at my front door -- and he 's eaten the tops off every one of my geraniums !
Where 's his owner or rider or something ? ''
The horse in question was a mild-eyed , rather good-looking quadruped , tied by a halter to the elm at Miss Cordelia 's door and contentedly munching a mouthful of geranium stalks .
Cynthia Ann came through the hedge with the letter .
`` Maybe this will explain , '' she said .
`` Same boy brought it as brought the horse -- a little freckly chap mostly all grin and shirtsleeves .
Said he was told to take the letter and horse to Miss Cordelia Herry , Elm Street , Point Pleasant , and he could n't wait .
So he tied the creature in there and left the letter with me .
He came half an hour ago .
Well , he has played havoc with your geraniums and no mistake . ''
Miss Cordelia opened and read her letter .
When she finished it she looked at the curious Cynthia Ann solemnly .
`` Well , if that is n't John Drew all over !
I suspected he was at the bottom of it as soon as I laid my eyes on that animal .
John Drew is a cousin of mine .
He 's been living out at Poplar Valley and he writes me that he has gone out west , and wants me to take ` old Nap . '
I suppose that is the horse .
He says that Nap is getting old and not much use for work and he could n't bear the thought of shooting him or selling him to someone who might ill-treat him , so he wants me to take him and be kind to him for old times ' sake .
John and I were just like brother and sister when we were children .
If this is n't like him nothing ever was .
He was always doing odd things and thinking they were all right .
And now he 's off west and here is the horse .
If it were a cat or a dog -- but a horse ! ''
`` Your four-acre field will come in handy now , '' said Cynthia Ann jestingly .
`` So it will . ''
Miss Cordelia spoke absently .
`` The very thing !
Yes , I 'll put him in there . ''
`` But you do n't really mean that you 're going to keep the horse , are you ? ''
protested Cynthia Ann .
`` Why , he is no good to you -- and think of the expense of feeding him ! ''
`` I 'll keep him for a while , '' said Miss Cordelia briskly .
`` As you say , there is the four-acre field .
It will keep him in eating for a while .
I always knew that field had a mission .
Poor John Drew !
I 'd like to oblige him for old times ' sake , as he says , although this is as crazy as anything he ever did .
But I have a plan .
Meanwhile , I ca n't feed Nap on geraniums . ''
Miss Cordelia always adapted herself quickly and calmly to new circumstances .
`` It is never any use to get in a stew about things , '' she was wont to say .
So now she untied Nap gingerly , with many rueful glances at her geraniums , and led him away to the field behind the house , where she tied him safely to a post with such an abundance of knots that there was small fear of his getting away .
When the mystified Cynthia Ann had returned home Miss Cordelia set about getting her tea and thinking over the plan that had come to her concerning her white elephant .
`` I can keep him for the summer , '' she said .
`` I 'll have to dispose of him in the fall for I 've no place to keep him in , and anyway I could n't afford to feed him .
I 'll see if I can borrow Mr. Griggs 's express wagon for Saturday afternoons , and if I can those poor factory children in my grade shall have a weekly treat or my name is not Cordelia Herry .
I 'm not so sure but that John Drew has done a good thing after all .
Poor John !
He always did take things so for granted . ''
* * * * * All the point pleasant people soon knew about Miss Cordelia 's questionable windfall , and she was overwhelmed with advice and suggestions .
She listened to all tranquilly and then placidly followed her own way .
Mr. Griggs was very obliging in regard to his old express wagon , and the next Saturday Point Pleasant was treated to a mild sensation -- nothing less than Miss Cordelia rattling through the village , enthroned on the high seat of Mr. Griggs 's yellow express wagon , drawn by old Nap who , after a week of browsing idleness in the four-acre field , was quite frisky and went at a decided amble down Elm Street and across the bridge .
The long wagon had been filled up with board seats , and when Miss Cordelia came back over the bridge the boards were crowded with factory children -- pale-faced little creatures whose eyes were aglow with pleasure at this unexpected outing .
Miss Cordelia drove straight out to the big pine-clad hills of Deepdale , six miles from Pottstown .
Then she tied Nap in a convenient lane and turned the children loose to revel in the woods and fields .
How they did enjoy themselves !
And how Miss Cordelia enjoyed seeing them enjoy themselves !
When dinner time came she gathered them all around her and went to the wagon .
In it she had a basket of bread and butter .
`` I ca n't afford anything more , '' she told Cynthia Ann , `` but they must have something to stay their little stomachs .
And I can get some water at a farmhouse . ''
Miss Cordelia had had her eye on a certain farmhouse all the morning .
She did not know anything about the people who lived there , but she liked the looks of the place .
It was a big , white , green-shuttered house , throned in wide-spreading orchards , with a green sweep of velvety lawn in front .
To this Miss Cordelia took her way , surrounded by her small passengers , and they all trooped into the great farmhouse yard just as a big man stepped out of a nearby barn .
As he approached , Miss Cordelia thought she had never seen anybody so much like an incarnate smile before .
Smiles of all kinds seemed literally to riot over his ruddy face and in and out of his eyes and around the corners of his mouth .
`` Well , well , well ! ''
he said , when he came near enough to be heard .
`` Is this a runaway school , ma'am ? ''
`` I 'm the runaway schoolma'am , '' responded Miss Cordelia with a twinkle .
`` And these are a lot of factory children I 've brought out for a Saturday treat .
I thought I might get some water from your well , and maybe you will lend us a tin dipper or two ? ''
`` Water ?
Tut , tut ! ''
said the big man , with three distinct smiles on his face .
`` Milk 's the thing , ma'am -- milk .
I 'll tell my housekeeper to bring some out .
And all of you come over to the lawn and make yourselves at home .
Bless you , ma'am , I 'm fond of children .
My name is Smiles , ma'am -- Abraham Smiles . ''
`` It suits you , '' said Miss Cordelia emphatically , before she thought , and then blushed rosy-red over her bluntness .
Mr. Smiles laughed .
`` Yes , I guess I always have an everlasting grin on .
Had to live up to my name , you see , in spite of my naturally cantankerous disposition ; But come this way , ma'am , I can see the hunger sticking out of those youngsters ' eyes .
We 'll have a sort of impromptu picnic here and now , I 'll tell my housekeeper to send out some jam too . ''
While the children devoured their lunch Miss Cordelia found herself telling Mr. Smiles all about old Nap and her little project .
`` I 'm going to bring out a load every fine Saturday all summer , '' she said .
`` It 's all I can do .
They enjoy it so , the little creatures .
It 's terrible to think how cramped their lives are .
They just exist in soot .
Some of them here never saw green fields before today . ''
Mr. Smiles listened and beamed and twinkled until Miss Cordelia felt almost as dazzled as if she were looking at the sun .
`` Look here , ma'am , I like this plan of yours and I want to have a hand in helping it along .
Bring your loads of children out here every Saturday , right here to Beechwood Farm , and turn them loose in my beech woods and upland pastures .
I 'll put up some swings for them and have some games , and I 'll provide the refreshments also .
Trouble , ma'am ?
No , trouble and I ai n't on speaking terms .
It 'll be a pleasure , ma'am .
I 'm fond of children even if I am a grumpy cross-grained old bachelor .
If you can give up your own holiday to give them a good time , surely I can do something too . ''
When Miss Cordelia and her brood of tired , happy little lads and lasses ambled back to town in the golden dusk she felt that the expedition had been an emphatic success .
Even old Nap seemed to jog along eye-deep in satisfaction .
Probably he was ruminating on the glorious afternoon he had spent in Mr. Smiles 's clover pasture .
Every fine Saturday that summer Miss Cordelia took some of the factory children to the country .
The Point Pleasant people nicknamed her equipage `` Miss Cordelia 's accommodation , '' and it became a mild standing joke .
As for Mr. Smiles , he proved a valuable assistant .
Like Miss Cordelia , he gave his Saturdays over to the children , and high weekly revel was held at Beechwood Farm .
But when the big bronze and golden leaves began to fall in the beech woods , Miss Cordelia sorrowfully realized that the summer was over and that the weekly outings which she had enjoyed as much as the children must soon be discontinued .
`` I feel so sorry , '' she told Mr. Smiles , `` but it ca n't be helped .
It will soon be too cold for our jaunts and of course I ca n't keep Nap through the winter .
I hate to part with him , I 've grown so fond of him , but I must . ''
She looked regretfully at Nap , who was nibbling Mr. Smiles 's clover aftermath .
He was sleek and glossy .
It had been the golden summer of Nap 's life .
Mr. Smiles coughed in an embarrassed fashion .
Miss Cordelia looked at him and was amazed to see that not a smile was on or about his face .
He looked absurdly serious .
`` I want to buy Nap , '' he said in a sepulchral tone , `` but that is not the only thing I want .
I want you too , ma'am .
I 'm tired of being a cross old bachelor .
I think I 'd like to be a cross old husband , for a change .
Do you think you could put up with me in that capacity , Miss Cordelia , my dear ? ''
Miss Cordelia gave a half gasp and then she had to laugh .
`` Oh , Mr. Smiles , I 'll agree to anything if you 'll only smile again .
It seems unnatural to see you look so solemn . ''
The smiles at once broke loose and revelled over her wooer 's face .
`` Then you will come ? ''
he said eagerly .
Half an hour later they had their plans made .
At New Year 's Miss Cordelia was to leave her school and sooty Pottstown and come to be mistress of Beechwood Farm .
`` And look here , '' said Mr. Smiles .
`` Every fine Saturday you shall have a big , roomy sleigh and Nap , and drive into town for some children and bring them out here for their weekly treat as usual .
The house is large enough to hold them , goodness knows , and if it is n't there are the barns for the overflow .
This is going to be our particular pet charity all our lives , ma'am -- I mean Cordelia , my dear . ''
`` Blessings on old Nap , '' said Miss Cordelia with a happy light in her eyes .
`` He shall live in clover for the rest of his days , '' added Mr. Smiles smilingly .
Ned 's Stroke of Business `` Jump in , Ned ; I can give you a lift if you 're going my way . ''
Mr. Rogers reined up his prancing grey horse , and Ned Allen sprang lightly into the comfortable cutter .
The next minute they were flying down the long , glistening road , rosy-white in the sunset splendour .
The first snow of the season had come , and the sleighing was , as Ned said , `` dandy . ''
`` Going over to Windsor , I suppose , '' said Mr. Rogers , with a glance at the skates that were hanging over Ned 's shoulder .
`` Yes , sir ; all the Carleton boys are going over tonight .
The moon is out , and the ice is good .
We have to go in a body , or the Windsor fellows wo n't leave us alone .
There 's safety in numbers . ''
`` Pretty hard lines when boys have to go six miles for a skate , '' commented Mr. Rogers .
`` Well , it 's that or nothing , '' laughed Ned .
`` There is n't a saucerful of ice any nearer , except that small pond in Old Dutcher 's field , behind his barn .
And you know Old Dutcher wo n't allow a boy to set foot there .
He says they would knock down his fences climbing over them , and like as not set fire to his barn . ''
`` Old Dutcher was always a crank , '' said Mr. Rogers , `` and doubtless will be to the end .
By the way , I heard a rumour to the effect that you are soon going to take a course at the business college in Trenton .
I hope it 's true . ''
Ned 's frank face clouded over .
`` I 'm afraid not , sir .
The truth is , I guess Mother ca n't afford it .
Of course , Aunt Ella has very kindly offered to board me free for the term , but fees , books , and so on would require at least fifty dollars .
I do n't expect to go . ''
`` That 's a pity .
Ca n't you earn the necessary money yourself ? ''
Ned shook his head .
`` Not much chance for that in Carleton , Mr. Rogers .
I 've cudgelled my brains for the past month trying to think of some way , but in vain .
Well , here is the crossroad , so I must get off .
Thank you for the drive , sir . ''
`` Keep on thinking , Ned , '' advised Mr. Rogers , as the lad jumped out .
`` Perhaps you 'll hit on some plan yet to earn that money , and if you do -- well , it will prove that you have good stuff in you . ''
`` I think it would , '' laughed Ned to himself , as he trudged away .
`` A quiet little farming village in winter is n't exactly a promising field for financial operations . ''
At Winterby Corners Ned found a crowd of boys waiting for him , and soon paired off with his chum , Jim Slocum .
Jim , as usual , was grumbling because they had to go all the way to Windsor to skate .
`` Like as not we 'll get into a free fight with the Windsorites when we get there , and be chevied off the ice , '' he complained .
The rivalry which existed between the Carleton and the Windsor boys was bitter and of long standing .
`` We ought to be able to hold our own tonight , '' said Ned .
`` There 'll be thirty of us there . ''
`` If we could only get Old Dutcher to let us skate on his pond ! ''
said Jim .
`` It would n't hurt his old pond !
And the ice is always splendid on it .
I 'd give a lot if we could only go there . ''
Ned was silent .
A sudden idea had come to him .
He wondered if it were feasible .
`` Anyhow , I 'll try it , '' he said to himself .
`` I 'll interview Old Dutcher tomorrow . ''
The skating that night was not particularly successful .
The small pond at Windsor was crowded , the Windsor boys being out in force and , although no positive disturbance arose , they contrived to make matters unpleasant for the Carletonites , who tramped moodily homeward in no very good humour , most of them declaring that , skating or no skating , they would not go to Windsor again .
The next day Ned Allen went down to see Mr. Dutcher , or Old Dutcher , as he was universally called in Carleton .
Ned did not exactly look forward to the interview with pleasure .
Old Dutcher was a crank -- there was no getting around that fact .
He had `` good days '' occasionally when , for him , he was fairly affable , but they were few and far between , and Ned had no reason to hope that this would be one .
Old Dutcher was unmarried , and his widowed sister kept house for him .
This poor lady had a decidedly lonely life of it , for Old Dutcher studiously discouraged visitors .
His passion for solitude was surpassed only by his eagerness to make and save money .
Although he was well-to-do , he would wrangle over a cent , and was the terror of all who had ever had dealings with him .
Fortunately for Ned and his project , this did turn out to be one of Old Dutcher 's good days .
He had just concluded an advantageous bargain with a Windsor cattle-dealer , and hence he received Ned with what , for Old Dutcher , might be called absolute cordiality .
Besides , although Old Dutcher disliked all boys on principle , he disliked Ned less than the rest because the boy had always treated him respectfully and had never played any tricks on him on Hallowe'en or April Fool 's Day .
`` I 've come down to see you on a little matter of business , Mr. Dutcher , '' said Ned , boldly and promptly .
It never did to beat about the bush with Old Dutcher ; you had to come straight to the point .
`` I want to know if you will rent your pond behind the barn to me for a skating-rink . ''
Old Dutcher 's aspect was certainly not encouraging .
`` No , I wo n't .
You ought to know that .
I never allow anyone to skate there .
I ai n't going to have a parcel of whooping , yelling youngsters tearing over my fences , disturbing my sleep at nights , and like as not setting fire to my barns .
No , sir !
I ai n't going to rent that pond for no skating-rink . ''
Ned smothered a smile .
`` Just wait a moment , Mr. Dutcher , '' he said respectfully .
`` I want you to hear my proposition before you refuse definitely .
First , I 'll give you ten dollars for the rent of the pond ; then I 'll see that there will be no running over your fields and climbing your fences , no lighting of fire or matches about it , and no ` whooping and yelling ' at nights .
My rink will be open only from two to six in the afternoon and from seven to ten in the evening .
During that time I shall always be at the pond to keep everything in order .
The skaters will come and go by the lane leading from the barn to the road .
I think that if you agree to my proposition , Mr. Dutcher , you will not regret it . ''
`` What 's to prevent my running such a rink myself ? ''
asked Old Dutcher gruffly .
`` It would n't pay you , Mr. Dutcher , '' answered Ned promptly .
`` The Carleton boys would n't patronize a rink run by you . ''
Old Dutcher 's eyes twinkled .
It did not displease him to know that the Carleton boys hated him .
In fact , it seemed as if he rather liked it .
`` Besides , '' went on Ned , `` you could n't afford the time .
You could n't be on the pond for eight hours a day and until ten o'clock at night .
I can , as I 've nothing else to do just now .
If I had , I would n't have to be trying to make money by a skating-rink . ''
Old Dutcher scowled .
Ten dollars was ten dollars and , as Ned had said , he knew very well that he could not run a rink by himself .
`` Well , '' he said , half reluctantly , `` I suppose I 'll let you go ahead .
Only remember I 'll hold you responsible if anything happens . ''
Ned went home in high spirits .
By the next day he had placards out in conspicuous places -- on the schoolhouse , at the forge , at Mr. Rogers 's store , and at Winterby Corners -- announcing that he had rented Mr. Dutcher 's pond for a skating-rink , and that tickets for the same at twenty-five cents a week for each skater could be had upon application to him .
Ned was not long left in doubt as to the success of his enterprise .
It was popular from the start .
There were about fifty boys in Carleton and Winterby , and they all patronized the rink freely .
At first Ned had some trouble with two or three rowdies , who tried to evade his rules .
He was backed up , however , by Old Dutcher 's reputation and by the public opinion of the other boys , as well as by his own undoubted muscle , and soon had everything going smoothly .
The rink flourished amain , and everybody , even Old Dutcher , was highly pleased .
At the end of the season Ned paid Old Dutcher his ten dollars , and had plenty left to pay for books and tuition at the business college in Trenton .
On the eve of his departure Mr. Rogers , who had kept a keen eye on Ned 's enterprise , again picked him up on the road .
`` So you found a way after all , Ned , '' he said genially .
`` I had an idea you would .
My bookkeeper will be leaving me about the time you will be through at the college .
I will be wanting in his place a young man with a good nose for business , and I rather think that you will be that young man .
What do you say ? ''
`` Thank you , sir , '' stammered Ned , scarcely believing his ears .
A position in Mr. Rogers 's store meant good salary and promotion .
He had never dared to hope for such good fortune .
`` If you -- think I can give satisfaction -- '' `` You manipulated Old Dutcher , and you 've earned enough in a very slow-going place to put you through your business-college term , so I am sure you are the man I 'm looking for .
I believe in helping those who have ` gumption ' enough to help themselves , so we 'll call it a bargain , Ned . ''
Our Runaway Kite Of course there was nobody for us to play with on the Big Half Moon , but then , as Claude says , you ca n't have everything .
We just had to make the most of each other , and we did .
The Big Half Moon is miles from anywhere , except the Little Half Moon .
But nobody lives there , so that does n't count .
We live on the Big Half Moon .
`` We '' are Father and Claude and I and Aunt Esther and Mimi and Dick .
It used to be only Father and Claude and I .
It is all on account of the kite that there are more of us .
This is what I want to tell you about .
Father is the keeper of the Big Half Moon lighthouse .
He has always been the keeper ever since I can remember , although that is n't very long .
I am only eleven years old .
Claude is twelve .
In winter , when the harbour is frozen over , there is n't any need of a light on the Big Half Moon , and we all move over to the mainland , and Claude and Mimi and Dick and I go to school .
But as soon as spring comes , back we sail to our own dear island , so glad that we do n't know what to do with ourselves .
The funny part used to be that people always pitied us when the time came for us to return .
They said we must be so lonesome over there , with no other children near us , and not even a woman to look after us .
Why , Claude and I were never lonesome .
There was always so much to do , and Claude is splendid at making believe .
He makes the very best pirate chief I ever saw .
Dick is pretty good , but he can never roar out his orders in the bloodcurdling tones that Claude can .
Of course Claude and I would have liked to have someone to play with us , because it is hard to run pirate caves and things like that with only two .
But we used to quarrel a good deal with the mainland children in winter , so perhaps it was just as well that there were none of them on the Big Half Moon .
Claude and I never quarrelled .
We used to argue sometimes and get excited , but that was as far as it ever went .
When I saw Claude getting too excited I gave in to him .
He is a boy , you know , and they have to be humoured ; they are not like girls .
As for having a woman to look after us , I thought that just too silly , and so did Claude .
What did we need with a woman when we had Father ?
He could cook all we wanted to eat and make molasses taffy that was just like a dream .
He kept our clothes all mended , and everything about the lighthouse was neat as wax .
Of course I helped him lots .
I like pottering round .
He used to hear our lessons and tell us splendid stories and saw that we always said our prayers .
Claude and I would n't have done anything to make him feel bad for the world .
Father is just lovely .
To be sure , he did n't seem to have any relations except us .
This used to puzzle Claude and me .
Everybody on the mainland had relations ; why had n't we ?
Was it because we lived on an island ?
We thought it would be so jolly to have an uncle and aunt and some cousins .
Once we asked Father about it , but he looked so sorrowful all of a sudden that we wished we had n't .
He said it was all his fault .
I did n't see how that could be , but I never said anything more about it to Father .
Still , I did wish we had some relations .
It is always lovely out here on the Big Half Moon in summer .
When it is fine the harbour is blue and calm , with little winds and ripples purring over it , and the mainland shores look like long blue lands where fairies dwell .
Away out over the bar , where the big ships go , it is always hazy and pearl-tinted , like the inside of the mussel shells .
Claude says he is going to sail out there when he grows up .
I would like to too , but Claude says I ca n't because I 'm a girl .
It is dreadfully inconvenient to be a girl at times .
When it storms it is grand to see the great waves come crashing up against the Big Half Moon as if they meant to swallow it right down .
You ca n't see the Little Half Moon at all then ; it is hidden by the mist and spume .
We had our pirate cave away up among the rocks , where we kept an old pistol with the lock broken , a rusty cutlass , a pair of knee boots , and Claude 's jute beard and wig .
Down on the shore , around one of the horns of the Half Moon , was the Mermaid 's Pool , where we sailed our toy boats and watched for sea kelpies .
We never saw any .
Dick says there is no such thing as a kelpy .
But then Dick has no imagination .
It is no argument against a thing that you 've never seen it .
I have never seen the pyramids , either , but I know that there are pyramids .
Every summer we had some hobby .
The last summer before Dick and Mimi came we were crazy about kites .
A winter boy on the mainland showed Claude how to make them , and when we went back to the Big Half Moon we made kites galore .
Even pirating was n't such good fun .
Claude would go around to the other side of the Big Half Moon and we would play shipwrecked mariners signalling to each other with kites .
Oh , it was very exciting .
We had one kite that was a dandy .
It was as big as we could make it and covered with lovely red paper ; we had pasted gold tinsel stars all over it and written our names out in full on it -- Claude Martin Leete and Philippa Brewster Leete , Big Half Moon Lighthouse .
That kite had the most magnificent tail , too .
It used to scare the gulls nearly to death when we sent up our kites .
They did n't know what to make of them .
And the Big Half Moon is such a place for gulls -- there are hundreds of them here .
One day there was a grand wind for kite-flying , and Claude and I were having a splendid time .
We used our smaller kites for signalling , and when we got tired of that Claude sent me to the house for the big one .
I 'm sure I do n't know how it happened , but when I was coming back over the rocks I tripped and fell , and my elbow went clear through that lovely kite .
You would never have believed that one small elbow could make such a big hole .
Claude said it was just like a girl to fall and stick her elbow through a kite , but I do n't see why it should be any more like a girl than a boy .
Do you ?
We had to hurry to fix the kite if we wanted to send it up before the wind fell , so we rushed into the lighthouse to get some paper .
We knew there was no more red paper , and the looks of the kite were spoiled , anyhow , so we just took the first thing that came handy -- an old letter that was lying on the bookcase in the sitting-room .
I suppose we should n't have taken it , although , as matters turned out , it was the best thing we could have done ; but Father was away to the mainland to buy things , and we never thought it could make any difference about an old yellow letter .
It was one Father had taken from a drawer in the bookcase which he had cleaned out the night before .
We patched the kite up with the letter , a sheet on each side , and dried it by the fire .
Then we started out , and up went the kite like a bird .
The wind was glorious , and it soared and strained like something alive .
All at once -- snap !
And there was Claude , standing with a bit of cord in his hand , looking as foolish as a flatfish , and our kite sailing along at a fearful rate of speed over to the mainland .
I might have said to Claude , So like a boy !
but I did n't .
Instead , I sympathized with him , and pointed out that it really did n't matter because I had spoiled it by jabbing my elbow through it .
By this time the kite was out of sight , and we never expected to see or hear of it again .
* * * * * A month later a letter came to the Big Half Moon for Father .
Jake Wiggins brought it over in his sloop .
Father went off by himself to read it , and such a queer-looking face as he had when he came back !
His eyes looked as if he had been crying , but that could n't be , I suppose , because Claude says men never cry .
Anyhow , his face was all glad and soft and smiley .
`` Do you two young pirates and freebooters want to know what has become of your kite ? ''
he said .
Then he sat down beside us on the rocks at the Mermaid 's Pool and told us the whole story , and read his letter to us .
It was the most amazing thing .
It seems Father had had relations after all -- a brother and a sister in particular .
But when he was a young man he quarrelled with his brother , who did n't treat him very well -- but he 's been dead for years , so I wo n't say a word against him -- and had gone away from home .
He never went back , and he never even let them know he was living .
Father says that this was very wrong of him , and I suppose it was , since he says so ; but I do n't see how Father could do anything wrong .
Anyway , he had a sister Esther whom he loved very much ; but he felt bitter against her too , because he thought she took his brother 's part too much .
So , though a letter of hers , asking him to go back , did reach him , he never answered it , and he never heard anything more .
Years afterward he felt sorry and went back , but his brother was dead and his sister had gone away , and he could n't find out a single thing about her .
So much for that ; and now about the kite .
The letter Father had just received was from his sister , our Aunt Esther and the mother of Dick and Mimi .
She was living at a place hundreds of miles inland .
Her husband was dead and , as we found out later , although she did not say a word about it in the letter , she was very poor .
One day when Dick and Mimi were out in the woods looking for botany specimens they saw something funny in the top of a tree .
Dick climbed up and got it .
It was a big red kite with a patch on each side and names written on it .
They carried it home to their mother .
Dick has since told us that she turned as pale as the dead when she saw our names on it .
You see , Philippa was her mother 's name and Claude was her father 's .
And when she read the letter that was pasted over the hole in the kite she knew who we must be , for it was the very letter she had written to her brother so long ago .
So she sat right down and wrote again , and this was the letter Jake Wiggins brought to the Big Half Moon .
It was a beautiful letter .
I loved Aunt Esther before I ever saw her , just from that letter .
Next day Father got Jake to take his place for a few days , and he left Claude and me over on the mainland while he went to see Aunt Esther .
When he came back he brought Aunt Esther and Dick and Mimi with him , and they have been here ever since .
You do n't know how splendid it is !
Aunt Esther is such a dear , and Dick and Mimi are too jolly for words .
They love the Big Half Moon as well as Claude and I do , and Dick makes a perfectly elegant shipwrecked mariner .
But the best of it all is that we have relations now !
The Bride Roses Miss Corona awoke that June morning with a sigh , the cause of which she was at first too sleepy to understand .
Then it all came over her with a little sickening rush ; she had fallen asleep with tear-wet lashes the night before on account of it .
This was Juliet Gordon 's wedding day , and she , Miss Corona , could not go to the wedding and was not even invited , all because of the Quarrel , a generation old , and so chronic and bitter and terrible that it always presented itself to Miss Corona 's mental vision as spelled with a capital .
Well might Miss Corona hate it .
It had shut her up into a lonely life for long years .
Juliet Gordon and Juliet 's father , Meredith Gordon , were the only relations Miss Corona had in the world , and the old family feud divided them by a gulf which now seemed impassable .
Miss Corona turned over on her pillows , lifted one corner of the white window-blind and peeped out .
Below her a river of early sunshine was flowing through the garden , and the far-away slopes were translucent green in their splendour of young day , with gauzy , uncertain mists lingering , spiritlike , in their intervales .
A bird , his sleek plumage iridescent in the sunlight , was perched on the big chestnut bough that ran squarely across the window , singing as if his heart would burst with melody and the joy of his tiny life .
No bride could have wished anything fairer for her day of days , and Miss Corona dropped back on her pillows with another gentle sigh .
`` I 'm so glad that the dear child has a fine day to be married , '' she said .
Juliet Gordon was always `` dear child '' to Miss Corona , although the two had never spoken to each other in their lives .
Miss Corona was a brisk and early riser as a rule , with a genuine horror of lazy people who lay late abed or took over-long to get their eyes well opened , but this morning she made no hurry about rising , even though scurrying footsteps , banging doors , and over-loud tinkling of dishes in the room below betokened that Charlotta was already up and about .
And Charlotta , as poor Miss Corona knew only too well , was fatally sure to do something unfortunate if she were not under some careful , overseeing eye .
To be sure , Charlotta 's intentions were always good .
But Miss Corona was not thinking about Charlotta this morning , and she felt so strong a distaste for her lonely , purposeless life that she was in no haste to go forth to meet another day of it .
Miss Corona felt just the least little bit tired of living , although she feared it was very wicked of her to feel so .
She lay there listlessly for half an hour longer , looking through a mist of tears at the portrait of her stern old father hanging on the wall at the foot of the bed , and thinking over the Quarrel .
It had happened thirty years ago , when Miss Corona had been a girl of twenty , living alone with her father at the old Gordon homestead on the hill , with the big black spruce grove behind it on the north and far-reaching slopes of green fields before it on the south .
Down in the little northern valley below the spruce grove lived her uncle , Alexis Gordon .
His son , Meredith , had seemed to Corona as her own brother .
The mothers of both were dead ; neither had any other brother or sister .
The two children had grown up together , playmates and devoted friends .
There had never been any sentiment or lovemaking between them to mar a perfect comradeship .
They were only the best of friends , whatever plans the fathers might have cherished for the union of their estates and children , putting the property consideration first , as the Gordons were always prone to do .
But , if Roderick and Alexis Gordon had any such plans , all went by the board when they quarreled .
Corona shivered yet over the bitterness of that time .
The Gordons never did anything half-heartedly .
The strife between the two brothers was determined and irreconcilable .
Corona 's father forbade her to speak to her uncle and cousin or to hold any communication with them .
Corona wept and obeyed him .
She had always obeyed her father ; it had never entered into her mind to do anything else .
Meredith had resented her attitude hotly , and from that day they had never spoken or met , while the years came and went , each making a little wider and more hopeless the gulf of coldness and anger and distrust .
Ten years later Roderick Gordon died , and in five months Alexis Gordon followed him to the grave .
The two brothers who had hated each other so unyieldingly in life slept very peaceably side by side in the old Gordon plot of the country graveyard , but their rancour still served to embitter the lives of their descendants .
Corona , with a half-guilty sense of disloyalty to her father , hoped that she and Meredith might now be friends again .
He was married , and had one little daughter .
In her new and intolerable loneliness Corona 's heart yearned after her own people .
But she was too timid to make any advances , and Meredith never made any .
Corona believed that he hated her , and let slip her last fluttering hope that the old breach would ever be healed .
`` Oh , dear !
oh , dear ! ''
she sobbed softly into her pillows .
It seemed a terrible thing to her that one of her race and kin was to be married and she could not be present at the ceremony , she who had never seen a Gordon bride .
When Miss Corona went downstairs at last , she found Charlotta sobbing in the kitchen porch .
The small handmaiden was doubled up on the floor , with her face muffled in her gingham apron and her long braids of red hair hanging with limp straightness down her back .
When Charlotta was in good spirits , they always hung perkily over each shoulder , tied up with enormous bows of sky-blue ribbon .
`` What have you done this time ? ''
asked Miss Corona , without the slightest intention of being humorous or sarcastic .
`` I 've -- I 've bruk your green and yaller bowl , '' sniffed Charlotta .
`` Did n't mean to , Miss C'rona .
It jest slipped out so fashion ` fore I c 'd grab holt on it .
And it 's bruk into forty millyun pieces .
Ai n't I the onluckiest girl ? ''
`` You certainly are , '' sighed Miss Corona .
At any other time she would have been filled with dismay over the untoward fate of her green and yellow bowl , which had belonged to her great-grandmother and had stood on the hall table to hold flowers as long as she could remember .
But just now her heart was so sore over the Quarrel that there was no room for other regrets .
`` Well , well , crying wo n't mend it .
I suppose it is a judgment on me for staying abed so late .
Go and sweep up the pieces , and do try and be a little more careful , Charlotte . ''
`` Yes 'm , '' said Charlotta meekly .
She dared not resent being called Charlotte just then .
`` And I 'll tell you what I 'll do , ma'am , to make up , I 'll go and weed the garden .
Yes 'm , I 'll do it beautiful . ''
`` And pull up more flowers than weeds , '' Miss Corona reflected mournfully .
But it did not matter ; nothing mattered .
She saw Charlotta sally forth into the garden with a determined , do-or-die expression surmounting her freckles , without feeling interest enough to go and make sure that she did not root out all the late asters in her tardy and wilfully postponed warfare on weeds .
This mood lasted until the afternoon .
Then Miss Corona , whose heart and thoughts were still down in the festive house in the valley , roused herself enough to go out and see what Charlotta was doing .
After finding out , she wandered idly about the rambling , old-fashioned place , which was full of nooks and surprises .
At every turn you might stumble on some clump or tangle of sweetness , showering elusive fragrance on the air , that you would never have suspected .
Nothing in the garden was planted quite where it should be , yet withal it was the most delightful spot imaginable .
Miss Corona pushed her way into the cherry-tree copse , and followed a tiny , overgrown path to a sunshiny corner beyond .
She had not been there since last summer ; the little path was getting almost impassable .
When she emerged from the cherry trees , somewhat rumpled and pulled about in hair and attire , but attended , as if by a benediction , by the aromatic breath of the mint she had trodden on , she gave a little cry and stood quite still , gazing at the rosebush that grew in the corner .
It was so large and woody that it seemed more like a tree than a bush , and it was snowed over with a splendour of large , pure white roses .
`` Dear life , '' whispered Miss Corona tremulously , as she tiptoed towards it .
`` The bride roses have bloomed again !
How very strange !
Why , there has not been a rose on that tree for twenty years . ''
The rosebush had been planted there by Corona 's great-grandmother , the lady of the green and yellow bowl .
It was a new variety , brought out from Scotland by Mary Gordon , and it bore large white roses which three generations of Gordon brides had worn on their wedding day .
It had come to be a family tradition among the Gordons that no luck would attend the bride who did not carry a white rose from Mary Gordon 's rose-tree .
Long years ago the tree had given up blooming , nor could all the pruning and care given it coax a single blossom from it .
Miss Corona , tinctured with the superstition apt to wait on a lonely womanhood , believed in her heart that the rosebush had a secret sympathy with the fortunes of the Gordon women .
She , the last of them on the old homestead , would never need the bride roses .
Wherefore , then , should the old tree bloom ?
And now , after all these years , it had flung all its long-hoarded sweetness into blossom again .
Miss Corona thrilled at the thought .
The rosebush had bloomed again for a Gordon bride , but Miss Corona was sure there was another meaning in it too ; she believed it foretokened some change in her own life , some rejuvenescence of love and beauty like to that of the ancient rose-tree .
She bent over its foam of loveliness almost reverently .
`` They have bloomed for Juliet 's wedding , '' she murmured .
`` A Gordon bride must wear the bride roses , indeed she must .
And this -- why , it is almost a miracle . ''
She ran , light-footedly as a girl , to the house for scissors and a basket .
She would send Juliet Gordon the bride roses .
Her cheeks were pink from excitement as she snipped them off .
How lovely they were !
How very large and fragrant !
It was as if all the grace and perfume and beauty and glory of those twenty lost summers were found here at once in them .
When Miss Corona had them ready , she went to the door and called , `` Charlotte !
Charlotte ! ''
Now Charlotta , having atoned to her conscience for the destruction of the green and yellow bowl by faithfully weeding the garden , a task which she hated above all else , was singing a hymn among the sweet peas , and her red braids were over her shoulders .
This ought to have warned Miss Corona , but Miss Corona was thinking of other things , and kept on calling patiently , while Charlotta weeded away for dear life , and seemed smitten with treble deafness .
After a time Miss Corona remembered and sighed .
She did hate to call the child that foolish name with its foreign sound .
Just as if plain `` Charlotte '' were not good enough for her , and much more suitable to `` Smith '' too !
Ordinarily Miss Corona would not have given in .
But the case was urgent ; she could not stand upon her dignity just now .
`` Charlotta ! ''
she called entreatingly .
Instantly Charlotta flew to the garden gate and raced up to the door .
`` Yes 'm , '' she said meekly .
`` You want me , Miss C'rona ? ''
`` Take this box down to Miss Juliet Gordon , and ask that it be given to her at once , '' said Miss Corona , `` Do n't loiter , Charlotta .
Do n't stop to pick gum in the grove , or eat sours in the dike , or poke sticks through the bridge , or -- '' But Charlotta had gone .
* * * * * Down in the valley , the other Gordon house was in a hum of excitement .
Upstairs Juliet had gone to her invalid mother 's room to show herself in her wedding dress to the pale little lady lying on the sofa .
She was a tall , stately young girl with the dark grey Gordon eyes and the pure creaminess of colouring , flawless as a lily petal .
Her face was a very sweet one , and the simple white dress she wore became her dainty , flowerlike beauty as nothing elaborate could have done .
`` I 'm not going to put on my veil until the last moment , '' she said laughingly .
`` I would feel married right away if I did .
And oh , Mother dear , is n't it too bad ?
My roses have n't come .
Father is back from the station , and they were not there .
I am so disappointed .
Romney ordered pure white roses because I said a Gordon bride must carry nothing else .
Come in '' -- as a knock sounded at the door .
Laura Burton , Juliet 's cousin and bridesmaid , entered with a box .
`` Juliet dear , the funniest little red-headed girl with the most enormous freckles has just brought this for you .
I have n't an idea where she came from ; she looked like a messenger from pixy-land . ''
Juliet opened the box and gave a cry .
`` Oh , Mother , look -- look !
What perfect roses !
Who could have sent them ?
Oh , here 's a note from -- from -- why , Mother , it 's from Cousin Corona . ''
`` My dear child , '' ran the letter in Miss Corona 's fine , old-fashioned script .
`` I am sending you the Gordon bride roses .
The rose-tree has bloomed for the first time in twenty years , my dear , and it must surely be in honour of your wedding day .
I hope you will wear them for , although I have never known you , I love you very much .
I was once a dear friend of your father 's .
Tell him to let you wear the roses I send for old times ' sake .
I wish you every happiness , my dear .
`` Your affectionate cousin , `` Corona Gordon . ''
`` Oh , how sweet and lovely of her ! ''
said Juliet gently , as she laid the letter down .
`` And to think she was not even invited !
I wanted to send her an invitation , but Father said it would be better not to -- she was so hard and bitter against us that she would probably regard it as an insult . ''
`` He must have been mistaken about her attitude , '' said Mrs. Gordon .
`` It certainly is a great pity she was not invited , but it is too late now .
An invitation sent two hours before the ceremony would be an insult indeed . ''
`` Not if the bride herself took it ! ''
exclaimed Juliet impulsively .
`` I 'll go myself to Cousin Corona , and ask her to come to my wedding . ''
`` Go yourself !
Child , you ca n't do such a thing !
In that dress ... '' `` Go I must , Momsie .
Why , it 's only a three minutes ' walk .
I 'll go up the hill by the old field-path , and no one will see me .
Oh , do n't say a word -- there , I 'm gone ! ''
`` That child ! ''
sighed the mother protestingly , as she heard Juliet 's flying feet on the stairs .
`` What a thing for a bride to do ! ''
Juliet , with her white silken skirts caught up above grasses and dust , ran light-footedly through the green lowland fields and up the hill , treading for the first time the faint old field-path between the two homes , so long disused that it was now barely visible in its fringing grasses and star-dust of buttercups .
Where it ran into the spruce grove was a tiny gate which Miss Corona had always kept in good repair , albeit it was never used .
Juliet pushed up the rusty hasp and ran through .
Miss Corona was sitting alone in her shadowy parlour , hanging over a few of the bride roses with falling tears , when something tall and beautiful and white , came in like a blessing and knelt by her chair .
`` Cousin Corona , '' said a somewhat breathless bride , `` I have come to thank you for your roses and ask you to forgive us all for the old quarrel . ''
`` Dear child , '' said Miss Corona out of her amazement , `` there is nothing to forgive .
I 've loved you all and longed for you .
Dear child , you have brought me great happiness . ''
`` And you must come to my wedding , '' cried Juliet .
`` Oh , you must -- or I shall think you have not really forgiven us .
You would never refuse the request of a bride , Cousin Corona .
We are queens on our wedding day , you know . ''
`` Oh , it 's not that , dear child -- but I 'm not dressed -- I -- '' `` I 'll help you dress .
And I wo n't go back without you .
The guests and the minister must wait if necessary -- yes , even Romney must wait .
Oh , I want you to meet Romney .
Come , dear . ''
And Miss Corona went .
Charlotta and the bride got her into her grey silk and did her hair , and in a very short time she and Juliet were hurrying down the old field-path .
In the hollow Meredith Gordon met them .
`` Cousin Meredith , '' said Miss Corona tremulously .
`` Dear Corona . ''
He took both her hands in his , and kissed her heartily .
`` Forgive me for misunderstanding you so long .
I thought you hated us all . ''
Turning to Juliet , he said with a fatherly smile , `` What a terrible girl it is for having its own way !
Who ever heard of a Gordon bride doing such an unconventional thing ?
There , scamper off to the house before your guests come .
Laura has made your roses up into what she calls ' a dream of a bouquet , ' I 'll take Cousin Corona up more leisurely . ''
`` Oh , I knew that something beautiful was going to happen when the old rose-tree bloomed , '' murmured Miss Corona happily .
The Josephs ' Christmas The month before Christmas was always the most exciting and mysterious time in the Joseph household .
Such scheming and planning , such putting of curly heads together in corners , such counting of small hoards , such hiding and smuggling of things out of sight , as went on among the little Josephs !
There were a good many of them , and very few of the pennies ; hence the reason for so much contriving and consulting .
From fourteen-year-old Mollie down to four-year-old Lennie there were eight small Josephs in all in the little log house on the prairie ; so that when each little Joseph wanted to give a Christmas box to each of the other little Josephs , and something to Father and Mother Joseph besides , it is no wonder that they had to cudgel their small brains for ways and means thereof .
Father and Mother were always discreetly blind and silent through December .
No questions were asked no matter what queer things were done .
Many secret trips to the little store at the railway station two miles away were ignored , and no little Joseph was called to account because he or she looked terribly guilty when somebody suddenly came into the room .
The air was simply charged with secrets .
Sister Mollie was the grand repository of these ; all the little Josephs came to her for advice and assistance .
It was Mollie who for troubled small brothers and sisters did such sums in division as this : How can I get a ten-cent present for Emmy and a fifteen-cent one for Jimmy out of eighteen cents ?
Or , how can seven sticks of candy be divided among eight people so that each shall have one ?
It was Mollie who advised regarding the purchase of ribbon and crepe paper .
It was Mollie who put the finishing touches to most of the little gifts .
In short , all through December Mollie was weighed down under an avalanche of responsibility .
It speaks volumes for her sagacity and skill that she never got things mixed up or made any such terrible mistake as letting one little Joseph find out what another was going to give him .
`` Dead '' secrecy was the keystone of all plans and confidences .
During this particular December the planning and contriving had been more difficult and the results less satisfactory than usual .
The Josephs were poor at any time , but this winter they were poorer than ever .
The crops had failed in the summer , and as a consequence the family were , as Jimmy said , `` on short commons . ''
But they made the brave best of their small resources , and on Christmas Eve every little Joseph went to bed with a clear conscience , for was there not on the corner table in the kitchen a small mountain of tiny -- sometimes very tiny -- gifts labelled with the names of recipients and givers , and worth their weight in gold if love and good wishes count for anything ?
It was beginning to snow when the small small Josephs went to bed , and when the big small Josephs climbed the stairs it was snowing thickly .
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph sat before the fire and listened to the wind howling about the house .
`` I 'm glad I 'm not driving over the prairie tonight , '' said Mr. Joseph .
`` It 's quite a storm .
I hope it will be fine tomorrow , for the children 's sake .
They 've set their hearts on having a sleigh ride , and it will be too bad if they ca n't have it when it 's about all the Christmas they 'll have this year .
Mary , this is the first Christmas since we came west that we could n't afford some little extras for them , even if 't was only a box of nuts and candy . ''
Mrs. Joseph sighed over Jimmy 's worn jacket which she was mending .
Then she smiled .
`` Never mind , John .
Things will be better next Christmas , we 'll hope .
The children will not mind , bless their hearts .
Look at all the little knick-knacks they 've made for each other .
Last week when I was over at Taunton , Mr. Fisher had his store all gayified up , ' as Jim says , with Christmas presents .
I did feel that I 'd ask nothing better than to go in and buy all the lovely things I wanted , just for once , and give them to the children tomorrow morning .
They 've never had anything really nice for Christmas .
But there !
We 've all got each other and good health and spirits , and a Christmas would n't be much without those if we had all the presents in the world . ''
Mr. Joseph nodded .
`` That 's so .
I do n't want to grumble ; but I tell you I did want to get Maggie a ` real live doll , ' as she calls it .
She never has had anything but homemade dolls , and that small heart of hers is set on a real one .
There was one at Fisher 's store today -- a big beauty with real hair , and eyes that opened and shut .
Just fancy Maggie 's face if she saw such a Christmas box as that tomorrow morning . ''
`` Do n't let 's fancy it , '' laughed Mrs. Joseph , `` it is only aggravating .
Talking of candy reminds me that I made a big plateful of taffy for the children today .
It 's all the ` Christmassy ' I could give them .
I 'll get it out and put it on the table along with the children 's presents .
That ca n't be someone at the door ! ''
`` It is , though , '' said Mr. Joseph as he strode to the door and flung it open .
Two snowed-up figures were standing on the porch .
As they stepped in , the Josephs recognized one of them as Mr. Ralston , a wealthy merchant in a small town fifteen miles away .
`` Late hour for callers , is n't it ? ''
said Mr. Ralston .
`` The fact is , our horse has about given out , and the storm is so bad that we ca n't proceed .
This is my wife , and we are on our way to spend Christmas with my brother 's family at Lindsay .
Can you take us in for the night , Mr. Joseph ? ''
`` Certainly , and welcome ! ''
exclaimed Mr. Joseph heartily , `` if you do n't mind a shakedown by the kitchen fire for the night .
My , Mrs. Ralston , '' as his wife helped her off with her things , `` but you are snowed up !
I 'll see to putting your horse away , Mr. Ralston .
This way , if you please . ''
When the two men came stamping into the house again Mrs. Ralston and Mrs. Joseph were sitting at the fire , the former with a steaming hot cup of tea in her hand .
Mr. Ralston put the big basket he was carrying down on a bench in the corner .
`` Thought I 'd better bring our Christmas flummery in , '' he said .
`` You see , Mrs. Joseph , my brother has a big family , so we are taking them a lot of Santa Claus stuff .
Mrs. Ralston packed this basket , and goodness knows what she put in it , but she half cleaned out my store .
The eyes of the Lindsay youngsters will dance tomorrow -- that is , if we ever get there . ''
Mrs. Joseph gave a little sigh in spite of herself , and looked wistfully at the heap of gifts on the corner table .
How meagre and small they did look , to be sure , beside that bulgy basket with its cover suggestively tied down .
Mrs. Ralston looked too .
`` Santa Claus seems to have visited you already , '' she said with a smile .
The Josephs laughed .
`` Our Santa Claus is somewhat out of pocket this year , '' said Mr. Joseph frankly .
`` Those are the little things the small folks here have made for each other .
They 've been a month at it , and I 'm always kind of relieved when Christmas is over and there are no more mysterious doings .
We 're in such cramped quarters here that you ca n't move without stepping on somebody 's secret . ''
A shakedown was spread in the kitchen for the unexpected guests , and presently the Ralstons found themselves alone .
Mrs. Ralston went over to the Christmas table and looked at the little gifts half tenderly and half pityingly .
`` They 're not much like the contents of our basket , are they ? ''
she said , as she touched the calendar Jimmie had made for Mollie out of cardboard and autumn leaves and grasses .
`` Just what I was thinking , '' returned her husband , `` and I was thinking of something else , too .
I 've a notion that I 'd like to see some of the things in our basket right here on this table . ''
`` I 'd like to see them all , '' said Mrs. Ralston promptly .
`` Let 's just leave them here , Edward .
Roger 's family will have plenty of presents without them , and for that matter we can send them ours when we go back home . ''
`` Just as you say , '' agreed Mr. Ralston .
`` I like the idea of giving the small folk of this household a rousing good Christmas for once .
They 're poor I know , and I dare say pretty well pinched this year like most of the farmers hereabout after the crop failure . ''
Mrs. Ralston untied the cover of the big basket .
Then the two of them , moving as stealthily as if engaged in a burglary , transferred the contents to the table .
Mr. Ralston got out a small pencil and a note book , and by dint of comparing the names attached to the gifts on the table they managed to divide theirs up pretty evenly among the little Josephs .
When all was done Mrs. Ralston said , `` Now , I 'm going to spread that tablecloth carelessly over the table .
We will be going before daylight , probably , and in the hurry of getting off I hope that Mr. and Mrs. Joseph will not notice the difference till we 're gone . ''
It fell out as Mrs. Ralston had planned .
The dawn broke fine and clear over a vast white world .
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph were early astir ; breakfast for the storm-stayed travellers was cooked and eaten by lamplight ; then the horse and sleigh were brought to the door and Mr. Ralston carried out his empty basket .
`` I expect the trail will be heavy , '' he said , `` but I guess we 'd get to Lindsay in time for dinner , anyway .
Much obliged for your kindness , Mr. Joseph .
When you and Mrs. Joseph come to town we shall hope to have a chance to return it .
Good-bye and a merry Christmas to you all . ''
When Mrs. Joseph went back to the kitchen her eyes fell on the heaped-up table in the corner .
`` Why-y ! ''
she said , and snatched off the cover .
One look she gave , and then this funny little mother began to cry ; but they were happy tears .
Mr. Joseph came too , and looked and whistled .
There really seemed to be everything on that table that the hearts of children could desire -- three pairs of skates , a fur cap and collar , a dainty workbasket , half a dozen gleaming new books , a writing desk , a roll of stuff that looked like a new dress , a pair of fur-topped kid gloves just Mollie 's size , and a china cup and saucer .
All these were to be seen at the first glance ; and in one corner of the table was a big box filled with candies and nuts and raisins , and in the other a doll with curling golden hair and brown eyes , dressed in `` real '' clothes and with all her wardrobe in a trunk beside her .
Pinned to her dress was a leaf from Mr. Ralston 's notebook with Maggie 's name written on it .
`` Well , this is Christmas with a vengeance , '' said Mr. Joseph .
`` The children will go wild with delight , '' said his wife happily .
They pretty nearly did when they all came scrambling down the stairs a little later .
Such a Christmas had never been known in the Joseph household before .
Maggie clasped her doll with shining eyes , Mollie looked at the workbasket that her housewifely little heart had always longed for , studious Jimmy beamed over the books , and Ted and Hal whooped with delight over the skates .
And as for the big box of good things , why , everybody appreciated that .
That Christmas was one to date from in that family .
I 'm glad to be able to say , too , that even in the heyday of their delight and surprise over their wonderful presents , the little Josephs did not forget to appreciate the gifts they had prepared for each other .
Mollie thought her calendar just too pretty for anything , and Jimmy was sure the new red mittens which Maggie had knitted for him with her own chubby wee fingers , were the very nicest , gayest mittens a boy had ever worn .
Mrs. Joseph 's taffy was eaten too .
Not a scrap of it was left .
As Ted said loyally , `` It was just as good as the candy in the box and had more ` chew ' to it besides . ''
The Magical Bond of the Sea A late September wind from the northwest was sweeping over the waters of Racicot Harbour .
It blew in , strong with the tang of the salt seas , past the grim lighthouse rock on the one hand and the sandbars on the other , up the long , narrow funnel of darkly blue water , until it whistled among the masts of the boats at anchor and among the stovepipe chimneys of the fishing village .
It was a wind that sang and piped and keened of many things -- but what it sang to each listener was only what was in that listener 's heart .
And Nora Shelley , standing at the door of her father 's bleached cottage on the grey sands , heard a new strain in it .
The wind had sung often to her of the outer world she longed for , but there had never been the note of fulfilment in it before .
There 's a new life beyond , Nora , whistled the wind .
A good life -- and it 's yours for the taking .
You have but to put out your hand and all you 've wished for will be in your grasp .
Nora leaned out from the door to meet the wind .
She loved that northwest gale ; it was a staunch old friend of hers .
Very slim and straight was Nora , with a skin as white as the foam flakes crisping over the sands , and eyes of the tremulous , haunting blue that deepens on the water after a fair sunset .
But her hair was as black as midnight , and her lips blossomed out with a ripe redness against the uncoloured purity of her face .
She was far and away the most beautiful of the harbour girls , but hardly the most popular .
Men and women alike thought her proud .
Even her friends felt themselves called upon to make excuses for her unlikeness to themselves .
Nora had dosed the door behind her to shut in the voices .
She wanted to be alone with the wind while she made her decision .
Before her the sandy shingle , made firm by a straggling growth of some pale sea-ivy , sloped down to the sapphire cup of the harbour .
Around her were the small , uncouth houses of the village -- no smaller or more uncouth than the one which was her home -- with children playing noisily on the paths between them .
The mackerel boats curtsied and nodded outside ; beyond them the sharp tip of Sandy Point was curdled white with seagulls .
Down at the curve of the cove a group of men were laughing and talking loudly in front of French Joe 's fish-house .
This was the life that she had always known .
Across the harbour , on a fir-fringed headland , stood Dalveigh .
John Cameron , childless millionaire , had built a summer cottage on that point two years ago , and given it the name of the old ancestral estate in Scotland .
To the Racicot fishing folk the house and grounds were as a dream of enchantment made real .
Few of them had ever seen anything like it .
Nora Shelley knew Dalveigh well .
She had been the Camerons ' guest many times that summer , finding in the luxury and beauty of their surroundings something that entered with a strange aptness into her own nature .
It was as if it were hers by right of fitness .
And this was the life that might be hers , did she so choose .
In reality , her choice was already made , and she knew it .
But it pleased her to pretend for a little time that it was not , and to dally tenderly with-the old loves and emotions that tugged at her heart and clamoured to be remembered .
Within , in the low-ceilinged living room , with its worn , uneven floor and its blackened walls hung with fish nets and oilskins , four people were sitting .
John Cameron and his wife were given the seats of honour in the middle of the room .
Mrs. Cameron was a handsome , well-dressed woman , with an expression that was discontented and , at times , petulant .
Yet her face had a good deal of plain common sense in it , and not even the most critical of the Racicot folks could say that she `` put on airs . ''
Her husband was a small , white-haired man , with a fresh , young-looking face .
He was popular in Racicot , for he mingled freely with the sailors and fishermen .
Moreover , Dalveigh was an excellent market for fresh mackerel .
Nathan Shelley , in his favourite corner behind the stove , sat lurching forward with his hands on his knees .
He had laid aside his pipe out of deference to Mrs. Cameron , and it was hard for him to think without it .
He wished his wife would go to work ; it seemed uncanny to see her idle .
She had sat idle only once that he remembered -- the day they had brought Ned Shelley in , dank and dripping , after the August storm ten years before .
Mrs. Shelley sat by the crooked , small-paned window and looked out down the harbour .
The coat she had been patching for her husband when the Camerons came still lay in her lap , and she had folded her hands upon it .
She was a big woman , slow of speech and manner , with a placid , handsome face -- a face that had not visibly stirred even when she had heard the Camerons ' proposition .
They wanted Nora -- these rich people who had so much in life wanted the blossom of girlhood that had never bloomed for them .
John Cameron pleaded his cause well .
`` We will look on her as our own , '' he said at last .
`` We have grown to love her this summer .
She is beautiful and clever -- she has a right to more than Racicot can give her .
You have other children -- we are childless .
And we do not take her from you utterly .
You will see her every summer when we come to Dalveigh . ''
`` It wo n't be the same thing quite , '' said Nathan Shelley drily .
`` She 'll belong to your life then -- not ours .
And no matter how many young ones folks has , they do n't want to lose none of 'em .
But I dunno as we ought to let our feelings stand in Nora 's light .
She 's clever , and she 's been hankering for more 'n we can ever give her .
I was the same way once .
Lord , how I raged at Racicot !
I broke away finally -- went to a city and got work .
But it was n't no use .
I 'd left it too long .
The sea had got into my blood .
I toughed it out for two years , and then I had to come back .
I did n't want to , mark you , but I had to come .
Been here ever since .
But maybe ` twill be different with the girl .
She 's younger than I was ; if the hankering for the sea and the life of the shore has n't got into her too deep , maybe she 'll be able to cut loose for good .
But you do n't know how the sea calls to one of its own . ''
Cameron smiled .
He thought that this dry old salt was a bit of a poet in his own way .
Very likely Nora got her ability and originality from him .
There did not seem to be a great deal in the phlegmatic , good-looking mother .
`` What say , wife ? ''
asked Shelley at last .
His wife had said in her slow way , `` Leave it to Nora , '' and to Nora it was left .
When she came in at last , her face stung to radiant beauty by the northwest wind , she found it hard to tell them after all .
She looked at her mother appealingly .
`` Is it go or stay , girl , '' demanded her father brusquely .
`` I think I 'll go , '' said Nora slowly .
Then , catching sight of her mother 's face , she ran to her and flung her arms about her .
`` But I 'll never forget you , Mother , '' she cried .
`` I 'll love you always -- you and Father . ''
Her mother loosened the clinging arms and pushed her gently towards the Camerons .
`` Go to them , '' she said calmly .
`` You belong to them now . ''
The news spread quickly over Racicot .
Before night everyone on the harbour shore knew that the Camerons were going to adopt Nora Shelley and take her away with them .
There was much surprise and more envy .
The shore women tossed their heads .
`` Reckon Nora is in great feather , '' they said .
`` She always did think herself better than anyone else .
Nate Shelley and his wife spoiled her ridiculous .
Wonder what Rob Fletcher thinks of it ? ''
Nora asked her brother to tell the news to Rob Fletcher himself , but Merran Andrews was before him .
She was at Rob before he had fairly landed , when the fishing boats came in at sunset .
`` Have you heard the news , Rob ?
Nora 's going away to be a fine lady .
The Camerons have been daft about her all summer , and now they are going to adopt her . ''
Merran wanted Rob herself .
He was a big , handsome fellow , and well-off -- the pick of the harbour men in every way .
He had slighted her for Nora , and it pleased her to stab him now , though she meant to be nice to him later on .
He turned white under his tan , but he did not choose to make a book of his heart for Merran 's bold black eyes to read .
`` It 's a great thing for her , '' he answered calmly .
`` She was meant for better things than can be found at Racicot . ''
`` She was always too good for common folks , if that is what you mean , '' said Merran spitefully .
Nora and Rob did not meet until the next evening , when she rowed herself home from Dalveigh .
He was at the shore to tie up her boat and help her out .
They walked up the sands together in the heart of the autumn sunset , with the northwest wind whistling in their ears and the great star of the lighthouse gleaming wanly out against the golden sky .
Nora felt uncomfortable , and resented it .
Rob Fletcher was nothing to her ; he never had been anything but the good friend to whom she told her strange thoughts and longings .
Why should her heart ache over him ?
She wished he would talk , but he strode along in silence , with his fine head drooping a little .
`` I suppose you have heard that I am going away , Rob ? ''
she said at last .
He nodded .
`` Yes , I 've heard it from a hundred mouths , more or less , '' he answered , not looking at her .
`` It 's a splendid thing for me , is n't it ? ''
dared Nora .
`` Well , I do n't know , '' he said slowly .
`` Looking at it from the outside , it seems so .
But from the inside it may n't look the same .
Do you think you 'll be able to cut twenty years of a life out of your heart without any pain ? ''
`` Oh , I 'll be homesick , if that is what you mean , '' said Nora petulantly .
`` Of course I 'll be that at first .
I expect it -- but people get over that .
And it is not as if I were going away for good .
I 'll be back next summer -- every summer . ''
`` It 'll be different , '' said Rob stubbornly , thinking as old Nathan Shelley had thought .
`` You 'll be a fine lady -- oh , all the better for that perhaps -- but you 'll not be the same .
No , no , the new life will change you ; not all at once , maybe , but in the end .
You 'll be one of them , not one of us .
But will you be happy ?
That 's the question I 'm asking . ''
In anyone else Nora would have resented this .
But she never felt angry with Rob .
`` I think I shall be , '' she said thoughtfully .
`` And , anyway , I must go .
It does n't seem as if I could help myself if I wanted to .
Something -- out beyond there -- is calling me , always has been calling me ever since I was a tiny girl and found out there was a big world far away from Racicot .
And it always seemed to me that I would find a way to it some day .
That was why I kept going to school long after the other girls stopped .
Mother thought I 'd better stop home ; she said too much book learning would make me discontented and too different from the people I had to live along .
But Father let me go ; he understood ; he said I was like him when he was young .
I learned everything and read everything I could .
It seems to me as if I had been walking along a narrow pathway all my life .
And now it seems as if a gate were opened before me and I can pass through into a wider world .
It is n't the luxury and the pleasure or the fine house and dresses that tempt me , though the people here think so -- even Mother thinks so .
But it is not .
It 's just that something seems to be in my grasp that I 've always longed for , and I must go -- Rob , I must go . ''
`` Yes , if you feel like that you must go , '' he answered , looking down at her troubled face gently .
`` And it 's best for you to go , Nora .
I believe that , and I 'm not so selfish as not to be able to hope that you 'll find all you long for .
But it will change you all the more if it is so .
Nora !
Nora !
Whatever am I going to do without you ! ''
The sudden passion bursting out in his tone frightened her .
`` Do n't , Rob , do n't !
And you wo n't miss me long .
There 's many another . ''
`` No , there is n't .
Do n't fling me that dry bone of comfort .
There 's no other , and never has been any other -- none but you , Nora , and well you know it . ''
`` I 'm sorry , '' she said faintly .
`` You need n't be , '' said Rob grimly .
`` After all , I 'd rather love you than not , hurt as it will .
I never had much hope of getting you to listen to me , so there 's no great disappointment there .
You 're too good for me -- I 've always known that .
A girl that is fit to mate with the Camerons is far above Rob Fletcher , fisherman . ''
`` I never had such a thought , '' protested Nora .
`` I know it , '' he said , casing himself up in his quietness again .
`` But it 's so -- and now I 've got to lose you .
But there 'll never be any other for me , Nora . ''
He left her at her father 's door .
She watched his stalwart figure out of sight around the point , and raged to find tears in her eyes and a bitter yearning in her heart .
For a moment she repented -- she would stay -- she could not go .
Then over the harbour flashed out the lights of Dalveigh .
The life behind them glittered , allured , beckoned .
Nay , she must go on -- she had made her choice .
There was no turning back now .
* * * * * Nora Shelley went away with the Camerons , and Dalveigh was deserted .
Winter came down on Racicot Harbour , and the colony of fisher folk at its head gave themselves over to the idleness of the season -- a time for lounging and gossipping and long hours of lazy contentment smoking in the neighbours ' chimney corners , when tales were told of the sea and the fishing .
The Harbour laid itself out to be sociable in winter .
There was no time for that in summer .
People had to work eighteen hours out of the twenty-four then .
In the winter there was spare time to laugh and quarrel , woo and wed and -- were a man so minded -- dream , as did Rob Fletcher in his loneliness .
In a Racicot winter much was made of small things .
The arrival of Nora Shelley 's weekly letter to her father and mother was an event in the village .
The post-mistress in the Cove store spread the news that it had come , and that night the Shelley kitchen would be crowded .
Isobel Shelley , Nora 's younger sister , read the letter aloud by virtue of having gone to school long enough to be able to pronounce the words and tell where the places named were situated .
The Camerons had spent the autumn in New York and had then gone south for the winter .
Nora wrote freely of her new life .
In the beginning she admitted great homesickness , but after the first few letters she made no further mention of that .
She wrote little of herself , but she described fully the places she had visited , the people she had met , the wonderful things she had seen .
She sent affectionate messages to all her old friends and asked after all her old interests .
But the letters came to be more and more like those of a stranger and one apart from the Racicot life , and the father and mother felt it .
`` She 's changing , '' muttered old Nathan .
`` It had to be so -- it 's well for her that it is so -- but it hurts .
She ai n't ours any more .
We 've lost the girl , wife , lost her forever . ''
Rob Fletcher always came and listened to the letters in silence while the others buzzed and commented .
Rob , so the Harbour folk said , was much changed .
He had grown unsociable and preferred to stay home and read books rather than go a-visiting as did others .
The Harbour folk shook their heads over this .
There was something wrong with a man who read books when there was a plenty of other amusements .
Jacob Radnor had read books all one winter and had drowned himself in the spring -- jumped overboard from his dory at the herring nets .
And that was what came of books , mark you .
The Camerons came later to Dalveigh the next summer , on account of John Cameron 's health , which was not good .
It was the first of August before a host of servants came to put Dalveigh in habitable order , and a week later the family came .
They brought a houseful of guests with them .
At sunset on the day of her arrival Nora Shelley looked out cross the harbour to the fishing village .
She was tired after her journey , and she had not meant to go over until the morning , but now she knew she must go at once .
Her mother was over there ; the old life called to her ; the northwest wind swept up the channel and whistled alluringly to her at the window of her luxurious room .
It brought to her the tang of the salt wastes and filled her heart with a great , bitter-sweet yearning .
She was more beautiful than ever .
In the year that had passed she had blossomed out to a gracious fulfilment of womanhood .
Even the Camerons had wondered at her swift adaptation to her new surroundings .
She seemed to have put Racicot behind her as one puts by an old garment .
In everything she had held her own royally .
Her adopted parents were proud of her beauty and her nameless , untamed charm .
They had lavished every indulgence upon her .
In those few short months she had lived more keenly and fully than in all her life before .
The Nora Shelley who went away was not , so it would seem , the Nora Shelley who came back .
But when she looked from her window to the waves and saw the star of the lighthouse and the blaze of the sunset in the window of the fishing-houses and heard the summons of the wind , something broke loose in her soul and overwhelmed her , like a wave of the sea .
She must go at once -- at once -- at once .
Not a moment could she wait .
She was dressed for dinner , but with tingling fingers she threw off her costly gown and put on her dark travelling suit again .
She left her hair as it was and knotted a crimson scarf about her head .
She would slip away quietly to the boathouse , get Davy to launch the little sailboat for her -- and then for a fleet skim over the harbour before that glorious wind !
She hoped not to be seen , but Mrs. Cameron met her in the hall .
`` Nora ! ''
she said in astonishment .
`` Oh , I must go , Aunty !
I must go ! ''
the girl cried feverishly .
She was afraid Mrs. Cameron would try to prevent her going , and all at once she knew that she could not bear that .
`` Must go ?
Where ?
Dinner is almost ready , and -- '' `` Oh , I do n't want any dinner .
I 'm going home -- I will sail over . ''
`` My dear child , do n't be foolish .
It 's too late to go over the harbour tonight .
They wo n't be expecting you .
Wait until the morning . ''
`` No -- oh , you do n't understand .
I must go -- I must !
My mother is over there . ''
Something in the girl 's last sentence or the tone in which it was uttered brought a look of pain to Mrs. Cameron 's face .
But she made no further attempt to dissuade her .
`` Well , if you must .
But you can not go alone -- no , Nora , I can not allow it .
The wind is too high and it is too late for you to go over by yourself .
Clark Bryant will take you . ''
Nora would have protested but she knew it would be in vain .
She submitted somewhat sullenly and walked down to the shore in silence .
Clark Bryant strode beside her , humouring her mood .
He was a tall , stout man , with an ugly , clever , sarcastic face .
He was as clever as he looked , and was one of the younger millionaires whom John Cameron drew around him in the development of his huge financial schemes .
Bryant was in love with Nora .
This was why the Camerons had asked him to join their August house party at Dalveigh , and why he had accepted .
It had occurred to Nora that this was the case , but as yet she had never troubled to think the situation over seriously .
She liked Clark Bryant well enough , but just at the moment he was in the way .
She did not want to take him over to Racicot -- just why she could not have explained .
There was in her no snobbish shame of her humble home .
But he did not belong there ; he was an alien , and she wished to go back to it for the first time alone .
At the boathouse Davy launched the small sailboat and Nora took the tiller .
She knew every inch of the harbour .
As the sail filled before the wind and the boat sprang across the upcurling waves , her brief sullenness fell away from her .
She no longer resented Clark Bryant 's presence -- she forgot it .
He was no more to her than the mast by which he stood .
The spell of the sea and the wind surged into her heart and filled it with wild happiness and measureless content .
Over yonder , where the lights gleamed on the darkening shore under the high-sprung arch of pale golden sky , was home .
How the wind whistled to welcome her back !
The lash of it against her face -- the flick of salt spray on her lips -- the swing of the boat as it cut through the racing crests -- how glorious it all was !
Clark Bryant watched her , understanding all at once that he was nothing to her , that he had no part or lot in her heart .
He was as one forgotten and left behind .
And how lovely , how desirable she was !
He had never seen her look so beautiful .
The shawl had slipped down to her shoulders and her head rose out of it like some magnificent flower out of a crimson calyx .
The masses of her black hair lifted from her face in the rush of the wind and swayed back again like rich shadows .
Her lips were stung scarlet with the sea 's sharp caresses , and her eyes , large and splendid , looked past him unseeing to the harbour lights of Racicot .
When they swung in by the wharf Nora sprang from the boat before Bryant had time to moor it .
Pausing for an instant , she called down to him , carelessly , `` Do n't wait for me .
I shall not go back tonight . ''
Then she caught her shawl around her head and almost ran up the wharf and along the shore .
No one was abroad , for it was supper hour in Racicot .
In the Shelley kitchen the family was gathered around the table , when the door was flung open and Nora stood on the threshold .
For a moment they gazed at her as at an apparition .
They had not known the precise day of her coming and were not aware of the Camerons ' arrival at Dalveigh .
`` It 's the girl herself .
It 's Nora , '' said old Nathan , rising from his bench .
`` Mother ! ''
cried Nora .
She ran across the room and buried her face in her mother 's breast , sobbing .
When the news spread , the Racicot people crowded in to see Nora until the house was full .
They spent a noisy , merry , whole-hearted evening of the old sort .
The men smoked and most of the women knitted while they talked .
They were pleased to find that Nora did not put on any airs .
Old Jonas Myers bluntly told her that he did n't see as her year among rich folks had done her much good , after all .
`` You 're just the same as when you went away , '' he said .
`` They have n't made a fine lady of you .
Folks here thought you 'd be something wonderful . ''
Nora laughed .
She was glad that they did not find her changed .
Old Nathan chuckled in his dry way .
There was a difference in the girl , and he saw it , though the neighbours did not , but it was not the difference he had feared .
His daughter was not utterly taken from him yet .
Nora sat by her mother and was happy .
But as the evening wore away she grew very quiet , and watched the door with something piteous in her eyes .
Old Nathan noticed it and thought she was tired .
He gave the curious neighbours a good-natured hint , and they presently withdrew .
When they had all gone Nora went out to the door alone .
The wind had died down and the shore , gemmed with its twinkling lights , was very still , for it was too late an hour for Racicot folk to be abroad in the mackerel season .
The moon was rising and the harbour was a tossing expanse of silver waves .
The mellow light fell on a tall figure lurking at the angle of the road that led past the Shelley cottage .
Nora saw and recognized it .
She flew down the sandy slope with outstretched hands .
`` Rob -- Rob ! ''
`` Nora ! ''
he said huskily , holding out his hand .
But she flung herself on his breast and clung to him , half laughing , half crying .
`` Oh , Rob !
I 've been looking for you all the evening .
Every time there was a step I said to myself , ` That is Rob , now . '
And when the door opened to let in another , my heart died within me .
I dared not even ask after you for fear of what they might tell me .
Why did n't you come ? ''
`` I did n't know that I 'd be welcome , '' he whispered , holding her closer to him .
`` I 've been hanging about thinking to get a glimpse of you unbeknown .
I thought maybe you would n't want to see me tonight . ''
`` Not want to see you !
Oh , Rob , this evening at Dalveigh , when I looked across to Racicot , it was you I thought of before all -- even before Mother . ''
She drew back and looked at him with her soul in her eyes .
`` What a splendid fellow you are -- how handsome you are , Rob ! ''
she cried .
All the reserve of womanhood fell away from her in the inrush of emotions .
For the moment she was a child again , telling out her thoughts with all a child 's frankness .
`` I 've been in a dream this past year -- a lovely dream -- a fair dream , but only a dream , after all .
And now I 've wakened .
And you are part of the wakening -- the best part !
Oh , to think I never knew before ! ''
`` Knew what , my girl ? ''
He had her close against his heart now ; the breath of her lips mingled with his , but he would not kiss her yet .
`` That I loved you , '' she whispered back .
`` Oh , Rob , you are all the world to me .
I belong to you and the sea .
But I never knew it until I crossed the harbour tonight .
Then I knew -- it came to me all at once , like a flood of understanding .
I knew I could never go away again -- that I must stay here forever where I could hear that call of wind and waves .
The new life was good -- good -- but it could not go deep enough .
And when you did not come I knew what was in my heart for you as well . ''
* * * * * That night Nora lay beside her sisters in the tiny room that looked out on the harbour .
The younger girls slept soundly , but Nora kept awake to listen to the laughter of the wind outside , and con over what she and Rob had said to each other .
There was no blot on her happiness save a sorry wonder what the Camerons would say when they knew .
`` They will think me ungrateful and fickle , '' she sighed .
`` They do n't know that I ca n't help it even if I would .
They will never understand . ''
Nor did they .
When Nora told them that she was going back to Racicot , they laughed at her kindly at first , treating it as the passing whim of a homesick girl .
Later , when they came to understand that she meant it , they were grieved and angry .
There were scenes of pleading and tears and reproaches .
Nora cried bitterly in Mrs. Cameron 's arms , but stood rock-firm .
She could never go back to them -- never .
They appealed to Nathan Shelley finally , but he refused to say anything .
`` It ca n't be altered , '' he told them .
`` The sea has called her and she 'll listen to naught else .
I 'm sorry enough for the girl 's own sake .
It would have been better for her if she could have cut loose from it all and lived your life , I dare say .
But you 've made a fair trial and it 's of no use .
I know what 's in her heart -- it was in mine once -- and I 'll say no word of rebuke to her .
She 's free to go or stay as she chooses -- just as free as she was last year . ''
Mrs. Cameron made one more appeal to Nora .
She told the girl bitterly that she was ungrateful .
`` I 'm not that , '' said Nora with quivering lips .
`` I love you , and I 'm grateful to you .
But your life is n't for me , after all .
I thought it was -- I longed so for it .
And I loved it , too -- I love it yet .
But there 's something stronger in me that holds me here . ''
`` I do n't think you realize what you are doing , Nora .
You have been a little homesick and you are glad to be back .
But after we have gone and you must settle into the old Racicot life again , you will not be contented .
You will find that your life with us will have unfitted you for this .
There will be no real place for you here -- nothing for you to do .
You will be as a stranger here . ''
`` Oh , no .
I am going to marry Rob Fletcher , '' said Nora proudly .
`` Marry Rob Fletcher !
And you might have married Clark Bryant , Nora ! ''
Nora shook her head .
`` That could never have been .
I thought it might once -- but I know better now .
You see , I love Rob . ''
There did not seem to be anything more to say after that .
Mrs. Cameron did not try to say anything .
She went away in sorrow .
Nora cried bitterly after she had gone .
But there were no tears in her eyes that night when she walked on the shore with Rob Fletcher .
The wind whistled around them , and the stars came out in the great ebony dome of the sky over the harbour .
Laughter and song of the fishing folk were behind them , and the deep , solemn call of the sea before .
Over the harbour gleamed the score of lights at Dalveigh .
Rob looked from them to Nora .
`` Do you think you 'll ever regret yon life , my girl ? ''
`` Never , Rob .
It seems to me now like a beautiful garment put on for a holiday and worn easily and pleasantly for a time .
But I 've put it off now , and put on workaday clothes again .
It is only a week since I left Dalveigh , but it seems long ago .
Listen to the wind , Rob !
It is singing of the good days to be for you and me . ''
He bent over and kissed her .
`` My own dear lass ! ''
he said softly .
The Martyrdom of Estella Estella was waiting under the poplars at the gate for Spencer Morgan .
She was engaged to him , and he always came to see her on Saturday and Wednesday evenings .
It was after sunset , and the air was mellow and warm-hued .
The willow trees along the walk and the tall birches in the background stood out darkly distinct against the lemon-tinted sky .
The breath of mint floated out from the garden , and the dew was falling heavily .
Estella leaned against the gate , listening for the sound of wheels and dreamily watching the light shining out from the window of Vivienne LeMar 's room .
The blind was up and she could see Miss LeMar writing at her table .
Her profile was clear and distinct against the lamplight .
Estella reflected without the least envy that Miss LeMar was very beautiful .
She had never seen anyone who was really beautiful before -- beautiful with the loveliness of the heroines in the novels she sometimes read or the pictures she had seen .
Estella Bowes was not pretty .
She was a nice-looking girl , with clear eyes , rosy cheeks , and a pervading air of the content and happiness her life had always known .
She was an orphan and lived with her uncle and aunt .
In the summer they sometimes took a boarder for a month or two , and this summer Miss LeMar had come .
She had been with them about a week .
She was an actress from the city and had around her all the glamour of a strange , unknown life .
Nothing was known about her .
The Boweses liked her well enough as a boarder .
Estella admired and held her in awe .
She wondered what Spencer would think of this beautiful woman .
He had not yet seen her .
It was quite dark when he came .
Estella opened the gate for him , but he got out of his buggy and walked up the lane beside her with his arm about her .
Miss LeMar 's light had removed to the parlour where she was singing , accompanying herself on the cottage organ .
Estella felt annoyed .
The parlour was considered her private domain on Wednesday and Saturday night , but Miss LeMar did not know that .
`` Who is singing ? ''
asked Spencer .
`` What a voice she has ! ''
`` That 's our new boarder , Miss LeMar , '' answered Estella .
`` She 's an actress and sings and does everything .
She is awfully pretty , Spencer . ''
`` Yes ? ''
said the young man indifferently .
He was not in the least interested in the Boweses ' new boarder .
Indeed , he considered her advent a nuisance .
He pressed Estella closer to him , and when they reached the garden gate he kissed her .
Estella always remembered that moment afterwards .
She was so supremely happy .
Spencer went off to put up his horse , and Estella waited for him on the porch steps , wondering if any other girl in the world could be quite so happy as she was , or love anyone as much as she loved Spencer .
She did not see how it could be possible , because there was only one Spencer .
When Spencer came back she took him into the parlour , half shyly , half proudly .
He was a handsome fellow , with a magnificent physique .
Miss LeMar stopped singing and turned around on the organ stool as they entered .
The little room was flooded with a mellow light from the pink-globed lamp on the table , and in the soft , shadowy radiance she was as beautiful as a dream .
She wore a dress of crepe , cut low in the neck .
Estella had never seen anyone dressed so before .
To her it seemed immodest .
She introduced Spencer .
He bowed awkwardly and sat stiffly down by the window with his eyes riveted on Miss LeMar 's face .
Estella , catching a glimpse of herself in the old-fashioned mirror above the mantel , suddenly felt a cold chill of dissatisfaction .
Her figure had never seemed to her so stout and stiff , her brown hair so dull and prim , her complexion so muddy , her features so commonplace .
She wished Miss LeMar would go out of the room .
Vivienne LeMar watched the two faces before her ; a hard gleam , half mockery , half malice , flashed into her eyes and a smile crept about her lips .
She looked straight in Spencer Morgan 's honest blue eyes and read there the young man 's dazzled admiration .
There was contempt in the look she turned on Estella .
`` You were singing when we came in , '' said Spencer .
