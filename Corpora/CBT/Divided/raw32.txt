`` Do you s ` pose Anne will ever get married now ? ''
speculated Davy anxiously .
`` When Dorcas Sloane got married last summer she said if she 'd had enough money to live on she 'd never have been bothered with a man , but even a widower with eight children was better 'n living with a sister-in-law . ''
`` Davy Keith , do hold your tongue , '' said Mrs. Rachel severely .
`` The way you talk is scandalous for a small boy , that 's what . ''
Chapter XIX An Interlude `` To think that this is my twentieth birthday , and that I 've left my teens behind me forever , '' said Anne , who was curled up on the hearth-rug with Rusty in her lap , to Aunt Jamesina who was reading in her pet chair .
They were alone in the living room .
Stella and Priscilla had gone to a committee meeting and Phil was upstairs adorning herself for a party .
`` I suppose you feel kind of , sorry '' said Aunt Jamesina .
`` The teens are such a nice part of life .
I 'm glad I 've never gone out of them myself . ''
Anne laughed .
`` You never will , Aunty .
You 'll be eighteen when you should be a hundred .
Yes , I 'm sorry , and a little dissatisfied as well .
Miss Stacy told me long ago that by the time I was twenty my character would be formed , for good or evil .
I do n't feel that it 's what it should be .
It 's full of flaws . ''
`` So 's everybody 's , '' said Aunt Jamesina cheerfully .
`` Mine 's cracked in a hundred places .
Your Miss Stacy likely meant that when you are twenty your character would have got its permanent bent in one direction or ` tother , and would go on developing in that line .
Do n't worry over it , Anne .
Do your duty by God and your neighbor and yourself , and have a good time .
That 's my philosophy and it 's always worked pretty well .
Where 's Phil off to tonight ? ''
`` She 's going to a dance , and she 's got the sweetest dress for it -- creamy yellow silk and cobwebby lace .
It just suits those brown tints of hers . ''
`` There 's magic in the words ` silk ' and ` lace , ' is n't there ? ''
said Aunt Jamesina .
`` The very sound of them makes me feel like skipping off to a dance .
And YELLOW silk .
It makes one think of a dress of sunshine .
I always wanted a yellow silk dress , but first my mother and then my husband would n't hear of it .
The very first thing I 'm going to do when I get to heaven is to get a yellow silk dress . ''
Amid Anne 's peal of laughter Phil came downstairs , trailing clouds of glory , and surveyed herself in the long oval mirror on the wall .
`` A flattering looking glass is a promoter of amiability , '' she said .
`` The one in my room does certainly make me green .
Do I look pretty nice , Anne ? ''
`` Do you really know how pretty you are , Phil ? ''
asked Anne , in honest admiration .
`` Of course I do .
What are looking glasses and men for ?
That was n't what I meant .
Are all my ends tucked in ?
Is my skirt straight ?
And would this rose look better lower down ?
I 'm afraid it 's too high -- it will make me look lop-sided .
But I hate things tickling my ears . ''
`` Everything is just right , and that southwest dimple of yours is lovely . ''
`` Anne , there 's one thing in particular I like about you -- you 're so ungrudging .
There is n't a particle of envy in you . ''
`` Why should she be envious ? ''
demanded Aunt Jamesina .
`` She 's not quite as goodlooking as you , maybe , but she 's got a far handsomer nose . ''
`` I know it , '' conceded Phil .
`` My nose always has been a great comfort to me , '' confessed Anne .
`` And I love the way your hair grows on your forehead , Anne .
And that one wee curl , always looking as if it were going to drop , but never dropping , is delicious .
But as for noses , mine is a dreadful worry to me .
I know by the time I 'm forty it will be Byrney .
What do you think I 'll look like when I 'm forty , Anne ? ''
`` Like an old , matronly , married woman , '' teased Anne .
`` I wo n't , '' said Phil , sitting down comfortably to wait for her escort .
`` Joseph , you calico beastie , do n't you dare jump on my lap .
I wo n't go to a dance all over cat hairs .
No , Anne , I WO N'T look matronly .
But no doubt I 'll be married . ''
`` To Alec or Alonzo ? ''
asked Anne .
`` To one of them , I suppose , '' sighed Phil , `` if I can ever decide which . ''
`` It should n't be hard to decide , '' scolded Aunt Jamesina .
`` I was born a see-saw Aunty , and nothing can ever prevent me from teetering . ''
`` You ought to be more levelheaded , Philippa . ''
`` It 's best to be levelheaded , of course , '' agreed Philippa , `` but you miss lots of fun .
As for Alec and Alonzo , if you knew them you 'd understand why it 's difficult to choose between them .
They 're equally nice . ''
`` Then take somebody who is nicer '' suggested Aunt Jamesina .
`` There 's that Senior who is so devoted to you -- Will Leslie .
He has such nice , large , mild eyes . ''
`` They 're a little bit too large and too mild -- like a cow 's , '' said Phil cruelly .
`` What do you say about George Parker ? ''
`` There 's nothing to say about him except that he always looks as if he had just been starched and ironed . ''
`` Marr Holworthy then .
You ca n't find a fault with him . ''
`` No , he would do if he was n't poor .
I must marry a rich man , Aunt Jamesina .
That -- and good looks -- is an indispensable qualification .
I 'd marry Gilbert Blythe if he were rich . ''
`` Oh , would you ? ''
said Anne , rather viciously .
`` We do n't like that idea a little bit , although we do n't want Gilbert ourselves , oh , no , '' mocked Phil .
`` But do n't let 's talk of disagreeable subjects .
I 'll have to marry sometime , I suppose , but I shall put off the evil day as long as I can . ''
`` You must n't marry anybody you do n't love , Phil , when all 's said and done , '' said Aunt Jamesina . ''
` Oh , hearts that loved in the good old way Have been out o ' the fashion this many a day . ' ''
trilled Phil mockingly .
`` There 's the carriage .
I fly -- Bi-bi , you two old-fashioned darlings . ''
When Phil had gone Aunt Jamesina looked solemnly at Anne .
`` That girl is pretty and sweet and goodhearted , but do you think she is quite right in her mind , by spells , Anne ? ''
`` Oh , I do n't think there 's anything the matter with Phil 's mind , '' said Anne , hiding a smile .
`` It 's just her way of talking . ''
Aunt Jamesina shook her head .
`` Well , I hope so , Anne .
I do hope so , because I love her .
But I ca n't understand her -- she beats me .
She is n't like any of the girls I ever knew , or any of the girls I was myself . ''
`` How many girls were you , Aunt Jimsie ? ''
`` About half a dozen , my dear . ''
Chapter XX Gilbert Speaks `` This has been a dull , prosy day , '' yawned Phil , stretching herself idly on the sofa , having previously dispossessed two exceedingly indignant cats .
Anne looked up from Pickwick Papers .
Now that spring examinations were over she was treating herself to Dickens .
`` It has been a prosy day for us , '' she said thoughtfully , `` but to some people it has been a wonderful day .
Some one has been rapturously happy in it .
Perhaps a great deed has been done somewhere today -- or a great poem written -- or a great man born .
And some heart has been broken , Phil . ''
`` Why did you spoil your pretty thought by tagging that last sentence on , honey ? ''
grumbled Phil .
`` I do n't like to think of broken hearts -- or anything unpleasant . ''
`` Do you think you 'll be able to shirk unpleasant things all your life , Phil ? ''
`` Dear me , no .
Am I not up against them now ?
You do n't call Alec and Alonzo pleasant things , do you , when they simply plague my life out ? ''
`` You never take anything seriously , Phil . ''
`` Why should I ?
There are enough folks who do .
The world needs people like me , Anne , just to amuse it .
It would be a terrible place if EVERYBODY were intellectual and serious and in deep , deadly earnest .
MY mission is , as Josiah Allen says , ` to charm and allure . '
Confess now .
Has n't life at Patty 's Place been really much brighter and pleasanter this past winter because I 've been here to leaven you ? ''
`` Yes , it has , '' owned Anne .
`` And you all love me -- even Aunt Jamesina , who thinks I 'm stark mad .
So why should I try to be different ?
Oh , dear , I 'm so sleepy .
I was awake until one last night , reading a harrowing ghost story .
I read it in bed , and after I had finished it do you suppose I could get out of bed to put the light out ?
No !
And if Stella had not fortunately come in late that lamp would have burned good and bright till morning .
When I heard Stella I called her in , explained my predicament , and got her to put out the light .
If I had got out myself to do it I knew something would grab me by the feet when I was getting in again .
By the way , Anne , has Aunt Jamesina decided what to do this summer ? ''
`` Yes , she 's going to stay here .
I know she 's doing it for the sake of those blessed cats , although she says it 's too much trouble to open her own house , and she hates visiting . ''
`` What are you reading ? ''
`` Pickwick . ''
`` That 's a book that always makes me hungry , '' said Phil .
`` There 's so much good eating in it .
The characters seem always to be reveling on ham and eggs and milk punch .
I generally go on a cupboard rummage after reading Pickwick .
The mere thought reminds me that I 'm starving .
Is there any tidbit in the pantry , Queen Anne ? ''
`` I made a lemon pie this morning .
You may have a piece of it . ''
Phil dashed out to the pantry and Anne betook herself to the orchard in company with Rusty .
It was a moist , pleasantly-odorous night in early spring .
The snow was not quite all gone from the park ; a little dingy bank of it yet lay under the pines of the harbor road , screened from the influence of April suns .
It kept the harbor road muddy , and chilled the evening air .
But grass was growing green in sheltered spots and Gilbert had found some pale , sweet arbutus in a hidden corner .
He came up from the park , his hands full of it .
Anne was sitting on the big gray boulder in the orchard looking at the poem of a bare , birchen bough hanging against the pale red sunset with the very perfection of grace .
She was building a castle in air -- a wondrous mansion whose sunlit courts and stately halls were steeped in Araby 's perfume , and where she reigned queen and chatelaine .
She frowned as she saw Gilbert coming through the orchard .
Of late she had managed not to be left alone with Gilbert .
But he had caught her fairly now ; and even Rusty had deserted her .
Gilbert sat down beside her on the boulder and held out his Mayflowers .
`` Do n't these remind you of home and our old schoolday picnics , Anne ? ''
Anne took them and buried her face in them .
`` I 'm in Mr. Silas Sloane 's barrens this very minute , '' she said rapturously .
`` I suppose you will be there in reality in a few days ? ''
`` No , not for a fortnight .
I 'm going to visit with Phil in Bolingbroke before I go home .
You 'll be in Avonlea before I will . ''
`` No , I shall not be in Avonlea at all this summer , Anne .
I 've been offered a job in the Daily News office and I 'm going to take it . ''
`` Oh , '' said Anne vaguely .
She wondered what a whole Avonlea summer would be like without Gilbert .
Somehow she did not like the prospect .
`` Well , '' she concluded flatly , `` it is a good thing for you , of course . ''
`` Yes , I 've been hoping I would get it .
It will help me out next year . ''
`` You must n't work too HARD , '' said Anne , without any very clear idea of what she was saying .
She wished desperately that Phil would come out .
`` You 've studied very constantly this winter .
Is n't this a delightful evening ?
Do you know , I found a cluster of white violets under that old twisted tree over there today ?
I felt as if I had discovered a gold mine . ''
`` You are always discovering gold mines , '' said Gilbert -- also absently .
`` Let us go and see if we can find some more , '' suggested Anne eagerly .
`` I 'll call Phil and -- '' `` Never mind Phil and the violets just now , Anne , '' said Gilbert quietly , taking her hand in a clasp from which she could not free it .
`` There is something I want to say to you . ''
`` Oh , do n't say it , '' cried Anne , pleadingly .
`` Do n't -- PLEASE , Gilbert . ''
`` I must .
Things ca n't go on like this any longer .
Anne , I love you .
You know I do .
I -- I ca n't tell you how much .
Will you promise me that some day you 'll be my wife ? ''
`` I -- I ca n't , '' said Anne miserably .
`` Oh , Gilbert -- you -- you 've spoiled everything . ''
`` Do n't you care for me at all ? ''
Gilbert asked after a very dreadful pause , during which Anne had not dared to look up .
`` Not -- not in that way .
I do care a great deal for you as a friend .
But I do n't love you , Gilbert . ''
`` But ca n't you give me some hope that you will -- yet ? ''
`` No , I ca n't , '' exclaimed Anne desperately .
`` I never , never can love you -- in that way -- Gilbert .
You must never speak of this to me again . ''
There was another pause -- so long and so dreadful that Anne was driven at last to look up .
Gilbert 's face was white to the lips .
And his eyes -- but Anne shuddered and looked away .
There was nothing romantic about this .
Must proposals be either grotesque or -- horrible ?
Could she ever forget Gilbert 's face ?
`` Is there anybody else ? ''
he asked at last in a low voice .
`` No -- no , '' said Anne eagerly .
`` I do n't care for any one like THAT -- and I LIKE you better than anybody else in the world , Gilbert .
And we must -- we must go on being friends , Gilbert . ''
Gilbert gave a bitter little laugh .
`` Friends !
Your friendship ca n't satisfy me , Anne .
I want your love -- and you tell me I can never have that . ''
`` I 'm sorry .
Forgive me , Gilbert , '' was all Anne could say .
Where , oh , where were all the gracious and graceful speeches wherewith , in imagination , she had been wont to dismiss rejected suitors ?
Gilbert released her hand gently .
`` There is n't anything to forgive .
There have been times when I thought you did care .
I 've deceived myself , that 's all .
Goodbye , Anne . ''
Anne got herself to her room , sat down on her window seat behind the pines , and cried bitterly .
She felt as if something incalculably precious had gone out of her life .
It was Gilbert 's friendship , of course .
Oh , why must she lose it after this fashion ?
`` What is the matter , honey ? ''
asked Phil , coming in through the moonlit gloom .
Anne did not answer .
At that moment she wished Phil were a thousand miles away .
`` I suppose you 've gone and refused Gilbert Blythe .
You are an idiot , Anne Shirley ! ''
`` Do you call it idiotic to refuse to marry a man I do n't love ? ''
said Anne coldly , goaded to reply .
`` You do n't know love when you see it .
You 've tricked something out with your imagination that you think love , and you expect the real thing to look like that .
There , that 's the first sensible thing I 've ever said in my life .
I wonder how I managed it ? ''
`` Phil , '' pleaded Anne , `` please go away and leave me alone for a little while .
My world has tumbled into pieces .
I want to reconstruct it . ''
`` Without any Gilbert in it ? ''
said Phil , going .
A world without any Gilbert in it !
Anne repeated the words drearily .
Would it not be a very lonely , forlorn place ?
Well , it was all Gilbert 's fault .
He had spoiled their beautiful comradeship .
She must just learn to live without it .
Chapter XXI Roses of Yesterday The fortnight Anne spent in Bolingbroke was a very pleasant one , with a little under current of vague pain and dissatisfaction running through it whenever she thought about Gilbert .
There was not , however , much time to think about him .
`` Mount Holly , '' the beautiful old Gordon homestead , was a very gay place , overrun by Phil 's friends of both sexes .
There was quite a bewildering succession of drives , dances , picnics and boating parties , all expressively lumped together by Phil under the head of `` jamborees '' ; Alec and Alonzo were so constantly on hand that Anne wondered if they ever did anything but dance attendance on that will-o ' - the-wisp of a Phil .
They were both nice , manly fellows , but Anne would not be drawn into any opinion as to which was the nicer .
`` And I depended so on you to help me make up my mind which of them I should promise to marry , '' mourned Phil .
`` You must do that for yourself .
You are quite expert at making up your mind as to whom other people should marry , '' retorted Anne , rather caustically .
`` Oh , that 's a very different thing , '' said Phil , truly .
But the sweetest incident of Anne 's sojourn in Bolingbroke was the visit to her birthplace -- the little shabby yellow house in an out-of-the-way street she had so often dreamed about .
She looked at it with delighted eyes , as she and Phil turned in at the gate .
`` It 's almost exactly as I 've pictured it , '' she said .
`` There is no honeysuckle over the windows , but there is a lilac tree by the gate , and -- yes , there are the muslin curtains in the windows .
How glad I am it is still painted yellow . ''
A very tall , very thin woman opened the door .
`` Yes , the Shirleys lived here twenty years ago , '' she said , in answer to Anne 's question .
`` They had it rented .
I remember 'em .
They both died of fever at onct .
It was turrible sad .
They left a baby .
I guess it 's dead long ago .
It was a sickly thing .
Old Thomas and his wife took it -- as if they had n't enough of their own . ''
`` It did n't die , '' said Anne , smiling .
`` I was that baby . ''
`` You do n't say so !
Why , you have grown , '' exclaimed the woman , as if she were much surprised that Anne was not still a baby .
`` Come to look at you , I see the resemblance .
You 're complected like your pa .
He had red hair .
But you favor your ma in your eyes and mouth .
She was a nice little thing .
My darter went to school to her and was nigh crazy about her .
They was buried in the one grave and the School Board put up a tombstone to them as a reward for faithful service .
Will you come in ? ''
`` Will you let me go all over the house ? ''
asked Anne eagerly .
`` Laws , yes , you can if you like .
` Two n't take you long -- there ai n't much of it .
I keep at my man to build a new kitchen , but he ai n't one of your hustlers .
The parlor 's in there and there 's two rooms upstairs .
Just prowl about yourselves .
I 've got to see to the baby .
The east room was the one you were born in .
I remember your ma saying she loved to see the sunrise ; and I mind hearing that you was born just as the sun was rising and its light on your face was the first thing your ma saw . ''
Anne went up the narrow stairs and into that little east room with a full heart .
It was as a shrine to her .
Here her mother had dreamed the exquisite , happy dreams of anticipated motherhood ; here that red sunrise light had fallen over them both in the sacred hour of birth ; here her mother had died .
Anne looked about her reverently , her eyes with tears .
It was for her one of the jeweled hours of life that gleam out radiantly forever in memory .
`` Just to think of it -- mother was younger than I am now when I was born , '' she whispered .
When Anne went downstairs the lady of the house met her in the hall .
She held out a dusty little packet tied with faded blue ribbon .
`` Here 's a bundle of old letters I found in that closet upstairs when I came here , '' she said .
`` I dunno what they are -- I never bothered to look in 'em , but the address on the top one is ` Miss Bertha Willis , ' and that was your ma 's maiden name .
You can take 'em if you 'd keer to have 'em . ''
`` Oh , thank you -- thank you , '' cried Anne , clasping the packet rapturously .
`` That was all that was in the house , '' said her hostess .
`` The furniture was all sold to pay the doctor bills , and Mrs. Thomas got your ma 's clothes and little things .
I reckon they did n't last long among that drove of Thomas youngsters .
They was destructive young animals , as I mind 'em . ''
`` I have n't one thing that belonged to my mother , '' said Anne , chokily .
`` I -- I can never thank you enough for these letters . ''
`` You 're quite welcome .
Laws , but your eyes is like your ma 's .
She could just about talk with hers .
Your father was sorter homely but awful nice .
I mind hearing folks say when they was married that there never was two people more in love with each other -- Pore creatures , they did n't live much longer ; but they was awful happy while they was alive , and I s ` pose that counts for a good deal . ''
Anne longed to get home to read her precious letters ; but she made one little pilgrimage first .
She went alone to the green corner of the `` old '' Bolingbroke cemetery where her father and mother were buried , and left on their grave the white flowers she carried .
Then she hastened back to Mount Holly , shut herself up in her room , and read the letters .
Some were written by her father , some by her mother .
There were not many -- only a dozen in all -- for Walter and Bertha Shirley had not been often separated during their courtship .
The letters were yellow and faded and dim , blurred with the touch of passing years .
No profound words of wisdom were traced on the stained and wrinkled pages , but only lines of love and trust .
The sweetness of forgotten things clung to them -- the far-off , fond imaginings of those long-dead lovers .
Bertha Shirley had possessed the gift of writing letters which embodied the charming personality of the writer in words and thoughts that retained their beauty and fragrance after the lapse of time .
The letters were tender , intimate , sacred .
To Anne , the sweetest of all was the one written after her birth to the father on a brief absence .
It was full of a proud young mother 's accounts of `` baby '' -- her cleverness , her brightness , her thousand sweetnesses .
`` I love her best when she is asleep and better still when she is awake , '' Bertha Shirley had written in the postscript .
Probably it was the last sentence she had ever penned .
The end was very near for her .
`` This has been the most beautiful day of my life , '' Anne said to Phil that night .
`` I 've FOUND my father and mother .
Those letters have made them REAL to me .
I 'm not an orphan any longer .
I feel as if I had opened a book and found roses of yesterday , sweet and beloved , between its leaves . ''
Chapter XXII Spring and Anne Return to Green Gables The firelight shadows were dancing over the kitchen walls at Green Gables , for the spring evening was chilly ; through the open east window drifted in the subtly sweet voices of the night .
Marilla was sitting by the fire -- at least , in body .
In spirit she was roaming olden ways , with feet grown young .
Of late Marilla had thus spent many an hour , when she thought she should have been knitting for the twins .
`` I suppose I 'm growing old , '' she said .
Yet Marilla had changed but little in the past nine years , save to grow something thinner , and even more angular ; there was a little more gray in the hair that was still twisted up in the same hard knot , with two hairpins -- WERE they the same hairpins ?
-- still stuck through it .
But her expression was very different ; the something about the mouth which had hinted at a sense of humor had developed wonderfully ; her eyes were gentler and milder , her smile more frequent and tender .
Marilla was thinking of her whole past life , her cramped but not unhappy childhood , the jealously hidden dreams and the blighted hopes of her girlhood , the long , gray , narrow , monotonous years of dull middle life that followed .
And the coming of Anne -- the vivid , imaginative , impetuous child with her heart of love , and her world of fancy , bringing with her color and warmth and radiance , until the wilderness of existence had blossomed like the rose .
Marilla felt that out of her sixty years she had lived only the nine that had followed the advent of Anne .
And Anne would be home tomorrow night .
The kitchen door opened .
Marilla looked up expecting to see Mrs. Lynde .
Anne stood before her , tall and starry-eyed , with her hands full of Mayflowers and violets .
`` Anne Shirley ! ''
exclaimed Marilla .
For once in her life she was surprised out of her reserve ; she caught her girl in her arms and crushed her and her flowers against her heart , kissing the bright hair and sweet face warmly .
`` I never looked for you till tomorrow night .
How did you get from Carmody ? ''
`` Walked , dearest of Marillas .
Have n't I done it a score of times in the Queen 's days ?
The mailman is to bring my trunk tomorrow ; I just got homesick all at once , and came a day earlier .
And oh !
I 've had such a lovely walk in the May twilight ; I stopped by the barrens and picked these Mayflowers ; I came through Violet-Vale ; it 's just a big bowlful of violets now -- the dear , sky-tinted things .
Smell them , Marilla -- drink them in . ''
Marilla sniffed obligingly , but she was more interested in Anne than in drinking violets .
`` Sit down , child .
You must be real tired .
I 'm going to get you some supper . ''
`` There 's a darling moonrise behind the hills tonight , Marilla , and oh , how the frogs sang me home from Carmody !
I do love the music of the frogs .
It seems bound up with all my happiest recollections of old spring evenings .
And it always reminds me of the night I came here first .
Do you remember it , Marilla ? ''
`` Well , yes , '' said Marilla with emphasis .
`` I 'm not likely to forget it ever . ''
`` They used to sing so madly in the marsh and brook that year .
I would listen to them at my window in the dusk , and wonder how they could seem so glad and so sad at the same time .
Oh , but it 's good to be home again !
Redmond was splendid and Bolingbroke delightful -- but Green Gables is HOME . ''
`` Gilbert is n't coming home this summer , I hear , '' said Marilla .
`` No . ''
Something in Anne 's tone made Marilla glance at her sharply , but Anne was apparently absorbed in arranging her violets in a bowl .
`` See , are n't they sweet ? ''
she went on hurriedly .
`` The year is a book , is n't it , Marilla ?
Spring 's pages are written in Mayflowers and violets , summer 's in roses , autumn 's in red maple leaves , and winter in holly and evergreen . ''
`` Did Gilbert do well in his examinations ? ''
persisted Marilla .
`` Excellently well .
He led his class .
But where are the twins and Mrs. Lynde ? ''
`` Rachel and Dora are over at Mr. Harrison 's .
Davy is down at Boulters ' .
I think I hear him coming now . ''
Davy burst in , saw Anne , stopped , and then hurled himself upon her with a joyful yell .
`` Oh , Anne , ai n't I glad to see you !
Say , Anne , I 've grown two inches since last fall .
Mrs. Lynde measured me with her tape today , and say , Anne , see my front tooth .
It 's gone .
Mrs. Lynde tied one end of a string to it and the other end to the door , and then shut the door .
I sold it to Milty for two cents .
Milty 's collecting teeth . ''
`` What in the world does he want teeth for ? ''
asked Marilla .
`` To make a necklace for playing Indian Chief , '' explained Davy , climbing upon Anne 's lap .
`` He 's got fifteen already , and everybody 's else 's promised , so there 's no use in the rest of us starting to collect , too .
I tell you the Boulters are great business people . ''
`` Were you a good boy at Mrs. Boulter 's ? ''
asked Marilla severely .
`` Yes ; but say , Marilla , I 'm tired of being good . ''
`` You 'd get tired of being bad much sooner , Davy-boy , '' said Anne .
`` Well , it 'd be fun while it lasted , would n't it ? ''
persisted Davy .
`` I could be sorry for it afterwards , could n't I ? ''
`` Being sorry would n't do away with the consequences of being bad , Davy .
Do n't you remember the Sunday last summer when you ran away from Sunday School ?
You told me then that being bad was n't worth while .
What were you and Milty doing today ? ''
`` Oh , we fished and chased the cat , and hunted for eggs , and yelled at the echo .
There 's a great echo in the bush behind the Boulter barn .
Say , what is echo , Anne ; I want to know . ''
`` Echo is a beautiful nymph , Davy , living far away in the woods , and laughing at the world from among the hills . ''
`` What does she look like ? ''
`` Her hair and eyes are dark , but her neck and arms are white as snow .
No mortal can ever see how fair she is .
She is fleeter than a deer , and that mocking voice of hers is all we can know of her .
You can hear her calling at night ; you can hear her laughing under the stars .
But you can never see her .
She flies afar if you follow her , and laughs at you always just over the next hill . ''
`` Is that true , Anne ?
Or is it a whopper ? ''
demanded Davy staring .
`` Davy , '' said Anne despairingly , `` have n't you sense enough to distinguish between a fairytale and a falsehood ? ''
`` Then what is it that sasses back from the Boulter bush ?
I want to know , '' insisted Davy .
`` When you are a little older , Davy , I 'll explain it all to you . ''
The mention of age evidently gave a new turn to Davy 's thoughts for after a few moments of reflection , he whispered solemnly : `` Anne , I 'm going to be married . ''
`` When ? ''
asked Anne with equal solemnity .
`` Oh , not until I 'm grown-up , of course . ''
`` Well , that 's a relief , Davy .
Who is the lady ? ''
`` Stella Fletcher ; she 's in my class at school .
And say , Anne , she 's the prettiest girl you ever saw .
If I die before I grow up you 'll keep an eye on her , wo n't you ? ''
`` Davy Keith , do stop talking such nonsense , '' said Marilla severely . ''
'T is n't nonsense , '' protested Davy in an injured tone .
`` She 's my promised wife , and if I was to die she 'd be my promised widow , would n't she ?
And she has n't got a soul to look after her except her old grandmother . ''
`` Come and have your supper , Anne , '' said Marilla , `` and do n't encourage that child in his absurd talk . ''
Chapter XXIII Paul Can not Find the Rock People Life was very pleasant in Avonlea that summer , although Anne , amid all her vacation joys , was haunted by a sense of `` something gone which should be there . ''
She would not admit , even in her inmost reflections , that this was caused by Gilbert 's absence .
But when she had to walk home alone from prayer meetings and A.V.I.S. pow-wows , while Diana and Fred , and many other gay couples , loitered along the dusky , starlit country roads , there was a queer , lonely ache in her heart which she could not explain away .
Gilbert did not even write to her , as she thought he might have done .
She knew he wrote to Diana occasionally , but she would not inquire about him ; and Diana , supposing that Anne heard from him , volunteered no information .
Gilbert 's mother , who was a gay , frank , light-hearted lady , but not overburdened with tact , had a very embarrassing habit of asking Anne , always in a painfully distinct voice and always in the presence of a crowd , if she had heard from Gilbert lately .
Poor Anne could only blush horribly and murmur , `` not very lately , '' which was taken by all , Mrs. Blythe included , to be merely a maidenly evasion .
Apart from this , Anne enjoyed her summer .
Priscilla came for a merry visit in June ; and , when she had gone , Mr. and Mrs. Irving , Paul and Charlotta the Fourth came `` home '' for July and August .
Echo Lodge was the scene of gaieties once more , and the echoes over the river were kept busy mimicking the laughter that rang in the old garden behind the spruces .
`` Miss Lavendar '' had not changed , except to grow even sweeter and prettier .
Paul adored her , and the companionship between them was beautiful to see .
`` But I do n't call her ` mother ' just by itself , '' he explained to Anne .
`` You see , THAT name belongs just to my own little mother , and I ca n't give it to any one else .
You know , teacher .
But I call her ` Mother Lavendar ' and I love her next best to father .
I -- I even love her a LITTLE better than you , teacher . ''
`` Which is just as it ought to be , '' answered Anne .
Paul was thirteen now and very tall for his years .
His face and eyes were as beautiful as ever , and his fancy was still like a prism , separating everything that fell upon it into rainbows .
He and Anne had delightful rambles to wood and field and shore .
Never were there two more thoroughly `` kindred spirits . ''
Charlotta the Fourth had blossomed out into young ladyhood .
She wore her hair now in an enormous pompador and had discarded the blue ribbon bows of auld lang syne , but her face was as freckled , her nose as snubbed , and her mouth and smiles as wide as ever .
`` You do n't think I talk with a Yankee accent , do you , Miss Shirley , ma'am ? ''
she demanded anxiously .
`` I do n't notice it , Charlotta . ''
`` I 'm real glad of that .
They said I did at home , but I thought likely they just wanted to aggravate me .
I do n't want no Yankee accent .
Not that I 've a word to say against the Yankees , Miss Shirley , ma'am .
They 're real civilized .
But give me old P.E. Island every time . ''
Paul spent his first fortnight with his grandmother Irving in Avonlea .
Anne was there to meet him when he came , and found him wild with eagerness to get to the shore -- Nora and the Golden Lady and the Twin Sailors would be there .
He could hardly wait to eat his supper .
Could he not see Nora 's elfin face peering around the point , watching for him wistfully ?
But it was a very sober Paul who came back from the shore in the twilight .
`` Did n't you find your Rock People ? ''
asked Anne .
Paul shook his chestnut curls sorrowfully .
`` The Twin Sailors and the Golden Lady never came at all , '' he said .
`` Nora was there -- but Nora is not the same , teacher .
She is changed . ''
`` Oh , Paul , it is you who are changed , '' said Anne .
`` You have grown too old for the Rock People .
They like only children for playfellows .
I am afraid the Twin Sailors will never again come to you in the pearly , enchanted boat with the sail of moonshine ; and the Golden Lady will play no more for you on her golden harp .
Even Nora will not meet you much longer .
You must pay the penalty of growing-up , Paul .
You must leave fairyland behind you . ''
`` You two talk as much foolishness as ever you did , '' said old Mrs. Irving , half-indulgently , half-reprovingly .
`` Oh , no , we do n't , '' said Anne , shaking her head gravely .
`` We are getting very , very wise , and it is such a pity .
We are never half so interesting when we have learned that language is given us to enable us to conceal our thoughts . ''
`` But it is n't -- it is given us to exchange our thoughts , '' said Mrs. Irving seriously .
She had never heard of Tallyrand and did not understand epigrams .
Anne spent a fortnight of halcyon days at Echo Lodge in the golden prime of August .
While there she incidentally contrived to hurry Ludovic Speed in his leisurely courting of Theodora Dix , as related duly in another chronicle of her history .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- Arnold Sherman , an elderly friend of the Irvings , was there at the same time , and added not a little to the general pleasantness of life .

`` What a nice play-time this has been , '' said Anne .
`` I feel like a giant refreshed .
And it 's only a fortnight more till I go back to Kingsport , and Redmond and Patty 's Place .
Patty 's Place is the dearest spot , Miss Lavendar .
I feel as if I had two homes -- one at Green Gables and one at Patty 's Place .
But where has the summer gone ?
It does n't seem a day since I came home that spring evening with the Mayflowers .
When I was little I could n't see from one end of the summer to the other .
It stretched before me like an unending season .
Now , '' tis a handbreadth , 't is a tale . ' ''
`` Anne , are you and Gilbert Blythe as good friends as you used to be ? ''
asked Miss Lavendar quietly .
`` I am just as much Gilbert 's friend as ever I was , Miss Lavendar . ''
Miss Lavendar shook her head .
`` I see something 's gone wrong , Anne .
I 'm going to be impertinent and ask what .
Have you quarrelled ? ''
`` No ; it 's only that Gilbert wants more than friendship and I ca n't give him more . ''
`` Are you sure of that , Anne ? ''
`` Perfectly sure . ''
`` I 'm very , very sorry . ''
`` I wonder why everybody seems to think I ought to marry Gilbert Blythe , '' said Anne petulantly .
`` Because you were made and meant for each other , Anne -- that is why .
You need n't toss that young head of yours .
It 's a fact . ''
Chapter XXIV Enter Jonas `` PROSPECT POINT , `` August 20th .
`` Dear Anne -- spelled -- with -- an -- E , '' wrote Phil , `` I must prop my eyelids open long enough to write you .
I 've neglected you shamefully this summer , honey , but all my other correspondents have been neglected , too .
I have a huge pile of letters to answer , so I must gird up the loins of my mind and hoe in .
Excuse my mixed metaphors .
I 'm fearfully sleepy .
Last night Cousin Emily and I were calling at a neighbor 's .
There were several other callers there , and as soon as those unfortunate creatures left , our hostess and her three daughters picked them all to pieces .
I knew they would begin on Cousin Emily and me as soon as the door shut behind us .
When we came home Mrs. Lilly informed us that the aforesaid neighbor 's hired boy was supposed to be down with scarlet fever .
You can always trust Mrs. Lilly to tell you cheerful things like that .
I have a horror of scarlet fever .
I could n't sleep when I went to bed for thinking of it .
I tossed and tumbled about , dreaming fearful dreams when I did snooze for a minute ; and at three I wakened up with a high fever , a sore throat , and a raging headache .
I knew I had scarlet fever ; I got up in a panic and hunted up Cousin Emily 's ` doctor book ' to read up the symptoms .
Anne , I had them all .
So I went back to bed , and knowing the worst , slept like a top the rest of the night .
Though why a top should sleep sounder than anything else I never could understand .
But this morning I was quite well , so it could n't have been the fever .
I suppose if I did catch it last night it could n't have developed so soon .
I can remember that in daytime , but at three o'clock at night I never can be logical .
`` I suppose you wonder what I 'm doing at Prospect Point .
Well , I always like to spend a month of summer at the shore , and father insists that I come to his second-cousin Emily 's ` select boardinghouse ' at Prospect Point .
So a fortnight ago I came as usual .
And as usual old ` Uncle Mark Miller ' brought me from the station with his ancient buggy and what he calls his ` generous purpose ' horse .
He is a nice old man and gave me a handful of pink peppermints .
Peppermints always seem to me such a religious sort of candy -- I suppose because when I was a little girl Grandmother Gordon always gave them to me in church .
Once I asked , referring to the smell of peppermints , ` Is that the odor of sanctity ? '
I did n't like to eat Uncle Mark 's peppermints because he just fished them loose out of his pocket , and had to pick some rusty nails and other things from among them before he gave them to me .
But I would n't hurt his dear old feelings for anything , so I carefully sowed them along the road at intervals .
When the last one was gone , Uncle Mark said , a little rebukingly , ` Ye should n't a ` et all them candies to onct , Miss Phil .
You 'll likely have the stummick-ache . '
`` Cousin Emily has only five boarders besides myself -- four old ladies and one young man .
My right-hand neighbor is Mrs. Lilly .
She is one of those people who seem to take a gruesome pleasure in detailing all their many aches and pains and sicknesses .
You can not mention any ailment but she says , shaking her head , ` Ah , I know too well what that is ' -- and then you get all the details .
Jonas declares he once spoke of locomotor ataxia in hearing and she said she knew too well what that was .
She suffered from it for ten years and was finally cured by a traveling doctor .
`` Who is Jonas ?
Just wait , Anne Shirley .
You 'll hear all about Jonas in the proper time and place .
He is not to be mixed up with estimable old ladies .
`` My left-hand neighbor at the table is Mrs. Phinney .
She always speaks with a wailing , dolorous voice -- you are nervously expecting her to burst into tears every moment .
She gives you the impression that life to her is indeed a vale of tears , and that a smile , never to speak of a laugh , is a frivolity truly reprehensible .
She has a worse opinion of me than Aunt Jamesina , and she does n't love me hard to atone for it , as Aunty J. does , either .
`` Miss Maria Grimsby sits cati-corner from me .
The first day I came I remarked to Miss Maria that it looked a little like rain -- and Miss Maria laughed .
I said the road from the station was very pretty -- and Miss Maria laughed .
I said there seemed to be a few mosquitoes left yet -- and Miss Maria laughed .
I said that Prospect Point was as beautiful as ever -- and Miss Maria laughed .
If I were to say to Miss Maria , ` My father has hanged himself , my mother has taken poison , my brother is in the penitentiary , and I am in the last stages of consumption , ' Miss Maria would laugh .
She ca n't help it -- she was born so ; but is very sad and awful .
`` The fifth old lady is Mrs. Grant .
She is a sweet old thing ; but she never says anything but good of anybody and so she is a very uninteresting conversationalist .
`` And now for Jonas , Anne .
`` That first day I came I saw a young man sitting opposite me at the table , smiling at me as if he had known me from my cradle .
I knew , for Uncle Mark had told me , that his name was Jonas Blake , that he was a Theological Student from St. Columbia , and that he had taken charge of the Point Prospect Mission Church for the summer .
`` He is a very ugly young man -- really , the ugliest young man I 've ever seen .
He has a big , loose-jointed figure with absurdly long legs .
His hair is tow-color and lank , his eyes are green , and his mouth is big , and his ears -- but I never think about his ears if I can help it .
`` He has a lovely voice -- if you shut your eyes he is adorable -- and he certainly has a beautiful soul and disposition .
`` We were good chums right way .
Of course he is a graduate of Redmond , and that is a link between us .
We fished and boated together ; and we walked on the sands by moonlight .
He did n't look so homely by moonlight and oh , he was nice .
Niceness fairly exhaled from him .
The old ladies -- except Mrs. Grant -- do n't approve of Jonas , because he laughs and jokes -- and because he evidently likes the society of frivolous me better than theirs .
`` Somehow , Anne , I do n't want him to think me frivolous .
This is ridiculous .
Why should I care what a tow-haired person called Jonas , whom I never saw before thinks of me ?
`` Last Sunday Jonas preached in the village church .
I went , of course , but I could n't realize that Jonas was going to preach .
The fact that he was a minister -- or going to be one -- persisted in seeming a huge joke to me .
`` Well , Jonas preached .
And , by the time he had preached ten minutes , I felt so small and insignificant that I thought I must be invisible to the naked eye .
Jonas never said a word about women and he never looked at me .
But I realized then and there what a pitiful , frivolous , small-souled little butterfly I was , and how horribly different I must be from Jonas ' ideal woman .
SHE would be grand and strong and noble .
He was so earnest and tender and true .
He was everything a minister ought to be .
I wondered how I could ever have thought him ugly -- but he really is !
-- with those inspired eyes and that intellectual brow which the roughly-falling hair hid on week days .
`` It was a splendid sermon and I could have listened to it forever , and it made me feel utterly wretched .
Oh , I wish I was like YOU , Anne .
`` He caught up with me on the road home , and grinned as cheerfully as usual .
But his grin could never deceive me again .
I had seen the REAL Jonas .
I wondered if he could ever see the REAL PHIL -- whom NOBODY , not even you , Anne , has ever seen yet . ''
` Jonas , ' I said -- I forgot to call him Mr. Blake .
Was n't it dreadful ?
But there are times when things like that do n't matter -- ` Jonas , you were born to be a minister .
You COULD N'T be anything else . ' ''
` No , I could n't , ' he said soberly . '
I tried to be something else for a long time -- I did n't want to be a minister .
But I came to see at last that it was the work given me to do -- and God helping me , I shall try to do it . '
`` His voice was low and reverent .
I thought that he would do his work and do it well and nobly ; and happy the woman fitted by nature and training to help him do it .
SHE would be no feather , blown about by every fickle wind of fancy .
SHE would always know what hat to put on .
Probably she would have only one .
Ministers never have much money .
But she would n't mind having one hat or none at all , because she would have Jonas .
`` Anne Shirley , do n't you dare to say or hint or think that I 've fallen in love with Mr. Blake .
Could I care for a lank , poor , ugly theologue -- named Jonas ?
As Uncle Mark says , ` It 's impossible , and what 's more it 's improbable . '
`` Good night , PHIL . ''
`` P.S. .
It is impossible -- but I am horribly afraid it 's true .
I 'm happy and wretched and scared .
HE can NEVER care for me , I know .
Do you think I could ever develop into a passable minister 's wife , Anne ?
And WOULD they expect me to lead in prayer ?
P G. '' Chapter XXV Enter Prince Charming `` I 'm contrasting the claims of indoors and out , '' said Anne , looking from the window of Patty 's Place to the distant pines of the park .
`` I 've an afternoon to spend in sweet doing nothing , Aunt Jimsie .
Shall I spend it here where there is a cosy fire , a plateful of delicious russets , three purring and harmonious cats , and two impeccable china dogs with green noses ?
Or shall I go to the park , where there is the lure of gray woods and of gray water lapping on the harbor rocks ? ''
`` If I was as young as you , I 'd decide in favor of the park , '' said Aunt Jamesina , tickling Joseph 's yellow ear with a knitting needle .
`` I thought that you claimed to be as young as any of us , Aunty , '' teased Anne .
`` Yes , in my soul .
But I 'll admit my legs are n't as young as yours .
You go and get some fresh air , Anne .
You look pale lately . ''
`` I think I 'll go to the park , '' said Anne restlessly .
`` I do n't feel like tame domestic joys today .
I want to feel alone and free and wild .
The park will be empty , for every one will be at the football match . ''
`` Why did n't you go to it ? '' ''
` Nobody axed me , sir , she said ' -- at least , nobody but that horrid little Dan Ranger .
I would n't go anywhere with him ; but rather than hurt his poor little tender feelings I said I was n't going to the game at all .
I do n't mind .
I 'm not in the mood for football today somehow . ''
`` You go and get some fresh air , '' repeated Aunt Jamesina , `` but take your umbrella , for I believe it 's going to rain .
I 've rheumatism in my leg . ''
`` Only old people should have rheumatism , Aunty . ''
`` Anybody is liable to rheumatism in her legs , Anne .
It 's only old people who should have rheumatism in their souls , though .
Thank goodness , I never have .
When you get rheumatism in your soul you might as well go and pick out your coffin . ''
It was November -- the month of crimson sunsets , parting birds , deep , sad hymns of the sea , passionate wind-songs in the pines .
Anne roamed through the pineland alleys in the park and , as she said , let that great sweeping wind blow the fogs out of her soul .
Anne was not wont to be troubled with soul fog .
But , somehow , since her return to Redmond for this third year , life had not mirrored her spirit back to her with its old , perfect , sparkling clearness .
Outwardly , existence at Patty 's Place was the same pleasant round of work and study and recreation that it had always been .
On Friday evenings the big , fire-lighted livingroom was crowded by callers and echoed to endless jest and laughter , while Aunt Jamesina smiled beamingly on them all .
The `` Jonas '' of Phil 's letter came often , running up from St. Columbia on the early train and departing on the late .
He was a general favorite at Patty 's Place , though Aunt Jamesina shook her head and opined that divinity students were not what they used to be .
`` He 's VERY nice , my dear , '' she told Phil , `` but ministers ought to be graver and more dignified . ''
`` Ca n't a man laugh and laugh and be a Christian still ? ''
demanded Phil .
`` Oh , MEN -- yes .
But I was speaking of MINISTERS , my dear , '' said Aunt Jamesina rebukingly .
`` And you should n't flirt so with Mr. Blake -- you really should n't . ''
`` I 'm not flirting with him , '' protested Phil .
Nobody believed her , except Anne .
The others thought she was amusing herself as usual , and told her roundly that she was behaving very badly .
`` Mr. Blake is n't of the Alec-and-Alonzo type , Phil , '' said Stella severely .
`` He takes things seriously .
You may break his heart . ''
`` Do you really think I could ? ''
asked Phil .
`` I 'd love to think so . ''
`` Philippa Gordon !
I never thought you were utterly unfeeling .
The idea of you saying you 'd love to break a man 's heart ! ''
`` I did n't say so , honey .
Quote me correctly .
I said I 'd like to think I COULD break it .
I would like to know I had the POWER to do it . ''
`` I do n't understand you , Phil .
You are leading that man on deliberately -- and you know you do n't mean anything by it . ''
`` I mean to make him ask me to marry him if I can , '' said Phil calmly .
`` I give you up , '' said Stella hopelessly .
Gilbert came occasionally on Friday evenings .
He seemed always in good spirits , and held his own in the jests and repartee that flew about .
He neither sought nor avoided Anne .
When circumstances brought them in contact he talked to her pleasantly and courteously , as to any newly-made acquaintance .
The old camaraderie was gone entirely .
Anne felt it keenly ; but she told herself she was very glad and thankful that Gilbert had got so completely over his disappointment in regard to her .
She had really been afraid , that April evening in the orchard , that she had hurt him terribly and that the wound would be long in healing .
Now she saw that she need not have worried .
Men have died and the worms have eaten them but not for love .
Gilbert evidently was in no danger of immediate dissolution .
He was enjoying life , and he was full of ambition and zest .
For him there was to be no wasting in despair because a woman was fair and cold .
Anne , as she listened to the ceaseless badinage that went on between him and Phil , wondered if she had only imagined that look in his eyes when she had told him she could never care for him .
There were not lacking those who would gladly have stepped into Gilbert 's vacant place .
But Anne snubbed them without fear and without reproach .
If the real Prince Charming was never to come she would have none of a substitute .
So she sternly told herself that gray day in the windy park .
Suddenly the rain of Aunt Jamesina 's prophecy came with a swish and rush .
Anne put up her umbrella and hurried down the slope .
As she turned out on the harbor road a savage gust of wind tore along it .
Instantly her umbrella turned wrong side out .
Anne clutched at it in despair .
And then -- there came a voice close to her .
`` Pardon me -- may I offer you the shelter of my umbrella ? ''
Anne looked up .
Tall and handsome and distinguished-looking -- dark , melancholy , inscrutable eyes -- melting , musical , sympathetic voice -- yes , the very hero of her dreams stood before her in the flesh .
He could not have more closely resembled her ideal if he had been made to order .
`` Thank you , '' she said confusedly .
`` We 'd better hurry over to that little pavillion on the point , '' suggested the unknown .
`` We can wait there until this shower is over .
It is not likely to rain so heavily very long . ''
The words were very commonplace , but oh , the tone !
And the smile which accompanied them !
Anne felt her heart beating strangely .
Together they scurried to the pavilion and sat breathlessly down under its friendly roof .
Anne laughingly held up her false umbrella .
`` It is when my umbrella turns inside out that I am convinced of the total depravity of inanimate things , '' she said gaily .
The raindrops sparkled on her shining hair ; its loosened rings curled around her neck and forehead .
Her cheeks were flushed , her eyes big and starry .
Her companion looked down at her admiringly .
She felt herself blushing under his gaze .
Who could he be ?
Why , there was a bit of the Redmond white and scarlet pinned to his coat lapel .
Yet she had thought she knew , by sight at least , all the Redmond students except the Freshmen .
And this courtly youth surely was no Freshman .
`` We are schoolmates , I see , '' he said , smiling at Anne 's colors .
`` That ought to be sufficient introduction .
My name is Royal Gardner .
And you are the Miss Shirley who read the Tennyson paper at the Philomathic the other evening , are n't you ? ''
`` Yes ; but I can not place you at all , '' said Anne , frankly .
`` Please , where DO you belong ? ''
`` I feel as if I did n't belong anywhere yet .
I put in my Freshman and Sophomore years at Redmond two years ago .
I 've been in Europe ever since .
Now I 've come back to finish my Arts course . ''
`` This is my Junior year , too , '' said Anne .
`` So we are classmates as well as collegemates .
I am reconciled to the loss of the years that the locust has eaten , '' said her companion , with a world of meaning in those wonderful eyes of his .
The rain came steadily down for the best part of an hour .
But the time seemed really very short .
When the clouds parted and a burst of pale November sunshine fell athwart the harbor and the pines Anne and her companion walked home together .
By the time they had reached the gate of Patty 's Place he had asked permission to call , and had received it .
Anne went in with cheeks of flame and her heart beating to her fingertips .
Rusty , who climbed into her lap and tried to kiss her , found a very absent welcome .
Anne , with her soul full of romantic thrills , had no attention to spare just then for a crop-eared pussy cat .
That evening a parcel was left at Patty 's Place for Miss Shirley .
It was a box containing a dozen magnificent roses .
Phil pounced impertinently on the card that fell from it , read the name and the poetical quotation written on the back .
`` Royal Gardner ! ''
she exclaimed .
`` Why , Anne , I did n't know you were acquainted with Roy Gardner ! ''
`` I met him in the park this afternoon in the rain , '' explained Anne hurriedly .
`` My umbrella turned inside out and he came to my rescue with his . ''
`` Oh ! ''
Phil peered curiously at Anne .
`` And is that exceedingly commonplace incident any reason why he should send us longstemmed roses by the dozen , with a very sentimental rhyme ?
Or why we should blush divinest rosy-red when we look at his card ?
Anne , thy face betrayeth thee . ''
`` Do n't talk nonsense , Phil .
Do you know Mr. Gardner ? ''
`` I 've met his two sisters , and I know of him .
So does everybody worthwhile in Kingsport .
The Gardners are among the richest , bluest , of Bluenoses .
Roy is adorably handsome and clever .
Two years ago his mother 's health failed and he had to leave college and go abroad with her -- his father is dead .
He must have been greatly disappointed to have to give up his class , but they say he was perfectly sweet about it .
Fee -- fi -- fo -- fum , Anne .
I smell romance .
Almost do I envy you , but not quite .
After all , Roy Gardner is n't Jonas . ''
`` You goose ! ''
said Anne loftily .
But she lay long awake that night , nor did she wish for sleep .
Her waking fancies were more alluring than any vision of dreamland .
Had the real Prince come at last ?
Recalling those glorious dark eyes which had gazed so deeply into her own , Anne was very strongly inclined to think he had .
Chapter XXVI Enter Christine The girls at Patty 's Place were dressing for the reception which the Juniors were giving for the Seniors in February .
Anne surveyed herself in the mirror of the blue room with girlish satisfaction .
She had a particularly pretty gown on .
Originally it had been only a simple little slip of cream silk with a chiffon overdress .
But Phil had insisted on taking it home with her in the Christmas holidays and embroidering tiny rosebuds all over the chiffon .
Phil 's fingers were deft , and the result was a dress which was the envy of every Redmond girl .
Even Allie Boone , whose frocks came from Paris , was wont to look with longing eyes on that rosebud concoction as Anne trailed up the main staircase at Redmond in it .
Anne was trying the effect of a white orchid in her hair .
Roy Gardner had sent her white orchids for the reception , and she knew no other Redmond girl would have them that night -- when Phil came in with admiring gaze .
`` Anne , this is certainly your night for looking handsome .
Nine nights out of ten I can easily outshine you .
The tenth you blossom out suddenly into something that eclipses me altogether .
How do you manage it ? ''
`` It 's the dress , dear .
Fine feathers . '' ''
'T is n't .
The last evening you flamed out into beauty you wore your old blue flannel shirtwaist that Mrs. Lynde made you .
If Roy had n't already lost head and heart about you he certainly would tonight .
But I do n't like orchids on you , Anne .
No ; it is n't jealousy .
Orchids do n't seem to BELONG to you .
They 're too exotic -- too tropical -- too insolent .
Do n't put them in your hair , anyway . ''
`` Well , I wo n't .
I admit I 'm not fond of orchids myself .
I do n't think they 're related to me .
Roy does n't often send them -- he knows I like flowers I can live with .
Orchids are only things you can visit with . ''
`` Jonas sent me some dear pink rosebuds for the evening -- but -- he is n't coming himself .
He said he had to lead a prayer-meeting in the slums !
I do n't believe he wanted to come .
Anne , I 'm horribly afraid Jonas does n't really care anything about me .
And I 'm trying to decide whether I 'll pine away and die , or go on and get my B.A. and be sensible and useful . ''
`` You could n't possibly be sensible and useful , Phil , so you 'd better pine away and die , '' said Anne cruelly .
`` Heartless Anne ! ''
`` Silly Phil !
You know quite well that Jonas loves you . ''
`` But -- he wo n't TELL me so .
And I ca n't MAKE him .
He LOOKS it , I 'll admit .
But speak-to-me-only-with-thine-eyes is n't a really reliable reason for embroidering doilies and hemstitching tablecloths .
I do n't want to begin such work until I 'm really engaged .
It would be tempting Fate . ''
`` Mr. Blake is afraid to ask you to marry him , Phil .
He is poor and ca n't offer you a home such as you 've always had .
You know that is the only reason he has n't spoken long ago . ''
`` I suppose so , '' agreed Phil dolefully .
`` Well '' -- brightening up -- `` if he WO N'T ask me to marry him I 'll ask him , that 's all .
So it 's bound to come right .
I wo n't worry .
By the way , Gilbert Blythe is going about constantly with Christine Stuart .
Did you know ? ''
Anne was trying to fasten a little gold chain about her throat .
She suddenly found the clasp difficult to manage .
WHAT was the matter with it -- or with her fingers ?
`` No , '' she said carelessly .
`` Who is Christine Stuart ? ''
`` Ronald Stuart 's sister .
She 's in Kingsport this winter studying music .
I have n't seen her , but they say she 's very pretty and that Gilbert is quite crazy over her .
How angry I was when you refused Gilbert , Anne .
But Roy Gardner was foreordained for you .
I can see that now .
You were right , after all . ''
Anne did not blush , as she usually did when the girls assumed that her eventual marriage to Roy Gardner was a settled thing .
All at once she felt rather dull .
Phil 's chatter seemed trivial and the reception a bore .
She boxed poor Rusty 's ears .
`` Get off that cushion instantly , you cat , you !
Why do n't you stay down where you belong ? ''
Anne picked up her orchids and went downstairs , where Aunt Jamesina was presiding over a row of coats hung before the fire to warm .
Roy Gardner was waiting for Anne and teasing the Sarah-cat while he waited .
The Sarah-cat did not approve of him .
She always turned her back on him .
But everybody else at Patty 's Place liked him very much .
Aunt Jamesina , carried away by his unfailing and deferential courtesy , and the pleading tones of his delightful voice , declared he was the nicest young man she ever knew , and that Anne was a very fortunate girl .
Such remarks made Anne restive .
Roy 's wooing had certainly been as romantic as girlish heart could desire , but -- she wished Aunt Jamesina and the girls would not take things so for granted .
When Roy murmured a poetical compliment as he helped her on with her coat , she did not blush and thrill as usual ; and he found her rather silent in their brief walk to Redmond .
He thought she looked a little pale when she came out of the coeds ' dressing room ; but as they entered the reception room her color and sparkle suddenly returned to her .
She turned to Roy with her gayest expression .
He smiled back at her with what Phil called `` his deep , black , velvety smile . ''
Yet she really did not see Roy at all .
She was acutely conscious that Gilbert was standing under the palms just across the room talking to a girl who must be Christine Stuart .
She was very handsome , in the stately style destined to become rather massive in middle life .
A tall girl , with large dark-blue eyes , ivory outlines , and a gloss of darkness on her smooth hair .
`` She looks just as I 've always wanted to look , '' thought Anne miserably .
`` Rose-leaf complexion -- starry violet eyes -- raven hair -- yes , she has them all .
It 's a wonder her name is n't Cordelia Fitzgerald into the bargain !
But I do n't believe her figure is as good as mine , and her nose certainly is n't . ''
Anne felt a little comforted by this conclusion .
Chapter XXVII Mutual Confidences March came in that winter like the meekest and mildest of lambs , bringing days that were crisp and golden and tingling , each followed by a frosty pink twilight which gradually lost itself in an elfland of moonshine .
Over the girls at Patty 's Place was falling the shadow of April examinations .
They were studying hard ; even Phil had settled down to text and notebooks with a doggedness not to be expected of her .
`` I 'm going to take the Johnson Scholarship in Mathematics , '' she announced calmly .
`` I could take the one in Greek easily , but I 'd rather take the mathematical one because I want to prove to Jonas that I 'm really enormously clever . ''
`` Jonas likes you better for your big brown eyes and your crooked smile than for all the brains you carry under your curls , '' said Anne .
`` When I was a girl it was n't considered lady-like to know anything about Mathematics , '' said Aunt Jamesina .
`` But times have changed .
I do n't know that it 's all for the better .
Can you cook , Phil ? ''
`` No , I never cooked anything in my life except a gingerbread and it was a failure -- flat in the middle and hilly round the edges .
You know the kind .
But , Aunty , when I begin in good earnest to learn to cook do n't you think the brains that enable me to win a mathematical scholarship will also enable me to learn cooking just as well ? ''
`` Maybe , '' said Aunt Jamesina cautiously .
`` I am not decrying the higher education of women .
My daughter is an M.A. .
She can cook , too .
But I taught her to cook BEFORE I let a college professor teach her Mathematics . ''
In mid-March came a letter from Miss Patty Spofford , saying that she and Miss Maria had decided to remain abroad for another year .
`` So you may have Patty 's Place next winter , too , '' she wrote .
`` Maria and I are going to run over Egypt .
I want to see the Sphinx once before I die . ''
`` Fancy those two dames ` running over Egypt ' !
I wonder if they 'll look up at the Sphinx and knit , '' laughed Priscilla .
`` I 'm so glad we can keep Patty 's Place for another year , '' said Stella .
`` I was afraid they 'd come back .
And then our jolly little nest here would be broken up -- and we poor callow nestlings thrown out on the cruel world of boardinghouses again . ''
`` I 'm off for a tramp in the park , '' announced Phil , tossing her book aside .
`` I think when I am eighty I 'll be glad I went for a walk in the park tonight . ''
`` What do you mean ? ''
asked Anne .
`` Come with me and I 'll tell you , honey . ''
They captured in their ramble all the mysteries and magics of a March evening .
Very still and mild it was , wrapped in a great , white , brooding silence -- a silence which was yet threaded through with many little silvery sounds which you could hear if you hearkened as much with your soul as your ears .
The girls wandered down a long pineland aisle that seemed to lead right out into the heart of a deep-red , overflowing winter sunset .
`` I 'd go home and write a poem this blessed minute if I only knew how , '' declared Phil , pausing in an open space where a rosy light was staining the green tips of the pines .
`` It 's all so wonderful here -- this great , white stillness , and those dark trees that always seem to be thinking . '' ''
` The woods were God 's first temples , ' '' quoted Anne softly .
`` One ca n't help feeling reverent and adoring in such a place .
I always feel so near Him when I walk among the pines . ''
`` Anne , I 'm the happiest girl in the world , '' confessed Phil suddenly .
`` So Mr. Blake has asked you to marry him at last ? ''
said Anne calmly .
`` Yes .
And I sneezed three times while he was asking me .
Was n't that horrid ?
But I said ` yes ' almost before he finished -- I was so afraid he might change his mind and stop .
I 'm besottedly happy .
I could n't really believe before that Jonas would ever care for frivolous me . ''
`` Phil , you 're not really frivolous , '' said Anne gravely . ''
` Way down underneath that frivolous exterior of yours you 've got a dear , loyal , womanly little soul .
Why do you hide it so ? ''
`` I ca n't help it , Queen Anne .
You are right -- I 'm not frivolous at heart .
But there 's a sort of frivolous skin over my soul and I ca n't take it off .
As Mrs. Poyser says , I 'd have to be hatched over again and hatched different before I could change it .
But Jonas knows the real me and loves me , frivolity and all .
And I love him .
I never was so surprised in my life as I was when I found out I loved him .
I 'd never thought it possible to fall in love with an ugly man .
Fancy me coming down to one solitary beau .
And one named Jonas !
But I mean to call him Jo .
That 's such a nice , crisp little name .
I could n't nickname Alonzo . ''
`` What about Alec and Alonzo ? ''
`` Oh , I told them at Christmas that I never could marry either of them .
It seems so funny now to remember that I ever thought it possible that I might .
They felt so badly I just cried over both of them -- howled .
But I knew there was only one man in the world I could ever marry .
I had made up my own mind for once and it was real easy , too .
It 's very delightful to feel so sure , and know it 's your own sureness and not somebody else 's . ''
`` Do you suppose you 'll be able to keep it up ? ''
`` Making up my mind , you mean ?
I do n't know , but Jo has given me a splendid rule .
He says , when I 'm perplexed , just to do what I would wish I had done when I shall be eighty .
Anyhow , Jo can make up his mind quickly enough , and it would be uncomfortable to have too much mind in the same house . ''
`` What will your father and mother say ? ''
`` Father wo n't say much .
He thinks everything I do right .
But mother WILL talk .
Oh , her tongue will be as Byrney as her nose .
But in the end it will be all right . ''
`` You 'll have to give up a good many things you 've always had , when you marry Mr. Blake , Phil . ''
`` But I 'll have HIM .
I wo n't miss the other things .
We 're to be married a year from next June .
Jo graduates from St. Columbia this spring , you know .
Then he 's going to take a little mission church down on Patterson Street in the slums .
Fancy me in the slums !
But I 'd go there or to Greenland 's icy mountains with him . ''
`` And this is the girl who would NEVER marry a man who was n't rich , '' commented Anne to a young pine tree .
`` Oh , do n't cast up the follies of my youth to me .
I shall be poor as gaily as I 've been rich .
You 'll see .
I 'm going to learn how to cook and make over dresses .
I 've learned how to market since I 've lived at Patty 's Place ; and once I taught a Sunday School class for a whole summer .
Aunt Jamesina says I 'll ruin Jo 's career if I marry him .
But I wo n't .
I know I have n't much sense or sobriety , but I 've got what is ever so much better -- the knack of making people like me .
There is a man in Bolingbroke who lisps and always testifies in prayer-meeting .
He says , ` If you ca n't thine like an electric thtar thine like a candlethtick . '
I 'll be Jo 's little candlestick . ''
`` Phil , you 're incorrigible .
Well , I love you so much that I ca n't make nice , light , congratulatory little speeches .
But I 'm heart-glad of your happiness . ''
`` I know .
Those big gray eyes of yours are brimming over with real friendship , Anne .
Some day I 'll look the same way at you .
You 're going to marry Roy , are n't you , Anne ? ''
`` My dear Philippa , did you ever hear of the famous Betty Baxter , who ` refused a man before he 'd axed her ' ?
I am not going to emulate that celebrated lady by either refusing or accepting any one before he ` axes ' me . ''
`` All Redmond knows that Roy is crazy about you , '' said Phil candidly .
`` And you DO love him , do n't you , Anne ? ''
`` I -- I suppose so , '' said Anne reluctantly .
She felt that she ought to be blushing while making such a confession ; but she was not ; on the other hand , she always blushed hotly when any one said anything about Gilbert Blythe or Christine Stuart in her hearing .
Gilbert Blythe and Christine Stuart were nothing to her -- absolutely nothing .
But Anne had given up trying to analyze the reason of her blushes .
As for Roy , of course she was in love with him -- madly so .
How could she help it ?
Was he not her ideal ?
Who could resist those glorious dark eyes , and that pleading voice ?
Were not half the Redmond girls wildly envious ?
And what a charming sonnet he had sent her , with a box of violets , on her birthday !
Anne knew every word of it by heart .
It was very good stuff of its kind , too .
Not exactly up to the level of Keats or Shakespeare -- even Anne was not so deeply in love as to think that .
But it was very tolerable magazine verse .
And it was addressed to HER -- not to Laura or Beatrice or the Maid of Athens , but to her , Anne Shirley .
To be told in rhythmical cadences that her eyes were stars of the morning -- that her cheek had the flush it stole from the sunrise -- that her lips were redder than the roses of Paradise , was thrillingly romantic .
Gilbert would never have dreamed of writing a sonnet to her eyebrows .
But then , Gilbert could see a joke .
She had once told Roy a funny story -- and he had not seen the point of it .
She recalled the chummy laugh she and Gilbert had had together over it , and wondered uneasily if life with a man who had no sense of humor might not be somewhat uninteresting in the long run .
But who could expect a melancholy , inscrutable hero to see the humorous side of things ?
It would be flatly unreasonable .
Chapter XXVIII A June Evening `` I wonder what it would be like to live in a world where it was always June , '' said Anne , as she came through the spice and bloom of the twilit orchard to the front door steps , where Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were sitting , talking over Mrs. Samson Coates ' funeral , which they had attended that day .
Dora sat between them , diligently studying her lessons ; but Davy was sitting tailor-fashion on the grass , looking as gloomy and depressed as his single dimple would let him .
`` You 'd get tired of it , '' said Marilla , with a sigh .
`` I daresay ; but just now I feel that it would take me a long time to get tired of it , if it were all as charming as today .
Everything loves June .
Davy-boy , why this melancholy November face in blossom-time ? ''
`` I 'm just sick and tired of living , '' said the youthful pessimist .
`` At ten years ?
Dear me , how sad ! ''
`` I 'm not making fun , '' said Davy with dignity .
`` I 'm dis -- dis -- discouraged '' -- bringing out the big word with a valiant effort .
`` Why and wherefore ? ''
asked Anne , sitting down beside him . ''
'Cause the new teacher that come when Mr. Holmes got sick give me ten sums to do for Monday .
It 'll take me all day tomorrow to do them .
It is n't fair to have to work Saturdays .
Milty Boulter said he would n't do them , but Marilla says I 've got to .
I do n't like Miss Carson a bit . ''
`` Do n't talk like that about your teacher , Davy Keith , '' said Mrs. Rachel severely .
`` Miss Carson is a very fine girl .
There is no nonsense about her . ''
`` That does n't sound very attractive , '' laughed Anne .
`` I like people to have a little nonsense about them .
But I 'm inclined to have a better opinion of Miss Carson than you have .
I saw her in prayer-meeting last night , and she has a pair of eyes that ca n't always look sensible .
Now , Davy-boy , take heart of grace .
` Tomorrow will bring another day ' and I 'll help you with the sums as far as in me lies .
Do n't waste this lovely hour ` twixt light and dark worrying over arithmetic . ''
`` Well , I wo n't , '' said Davy , brightening up .
`` If you help me with the sums I 'll have 'em done in time to go fishing with Milty .
I wish old Aunt Atossa 's funeral was tomorrow instead of today .
I wanted to go to it 'cause Milty said his mother said Aunt Atossa would be sure to rise up in her coffin and say sarcastic things to the folks that come to see her buried .
But Marilla said she did n't . ''
`` Poor Atossa laid in her coffin peaceful enough , '' said Mrs. Lynde solemnly .
`` I never saw her look so pleasant before , that 's what .
Well , there were n't many tears shed over her , poor old soul .
The Elisha Wrights are thankful to be rid of her , and I ca n't say I blame them a mite . ''
`` It seems to me a most dreadful thing to go out of the world and not leave one person behind you who is sorry you are gone , '' said Anne , shuddering .
`` Nobody except her parents ever loved poor Atossa , that 's certain , not even her husband , '' averred Mrs. Lynde .
`` She was his fourth wife .
He 'd sort of got into the habit of marrying .
He only lived a few years after he married her .
The doctor said he died of dyspepsia , but I shall always maintain that he died of Atossa 's tongue , that 's what .
Poor soul , she always knew everything about her neighbors , but she never was very well acquainted with herself .
Well , she 's gone anyhow ; and I suppose the next excitement will be Diana 's wedding . ''
`` It seems funny and horrible to think of Diana 's being married , '' sighed Anne , hugging her knees and looking through the gap in the Haunted Wood to the light that was shining in Diana 's room .
`` I do n't see what 's horrible about it , when she 's doing so well , '' said Mrs. Lynde emphatically .
`` Fred Wright has a fine farm and he is a model young man . ''
`` He certainly is n't the wild , dashing , wicked , young man Diana once wanted to marry , '' smiled Anne .
`` Fred is extremely good . ''
`` That 's just what he ought to be .
Would you want Diana to marry a wicked man ?
Or marry one yourself ? ''
`` Oh , no .
I would n't want to marry anybody who was wicked , but I think I 'd like it if he COULD be wicked and WOULD N'T .
Now , Fred is HOPELESSLY good . ''
`` You 'll have more sense some day , I hope , '' said Marilla .
Marilla spoke rather bitterly .
She was grievously disappointed .
She knew Anne had refused Gilbert Blythe .
Avonlea gossip buzzed over the fact , which had leaked out , nobody knew how .
Perhaps Charlie Sloane had guessed and told his guesses for truth .
Perhaps Diana had betrayed it to Fred and Fred had been indiscreet .
At all events it was known ; Mrs. Blythe no longer asked Anne , in public or private , if she had heard lately from Gilbert , but passed her by with a frosty bow .
Anne , who had always liked Gilbert 's merry , young-hearted mother , was grieved in secret over this .
Marilla said nothing ; but Mrs. Lynde gave Anne many exasperated digs about it , until fresh gossip reached that worthy lady , through the medium of Moody Spurgeon MacPherson 's mother , that Anne had another `` beau '' at college , who was rich and handsome and good all in one .
After that Mrs. Rachel held her tongue , though she still wished in her inmost heart that Anne had accepted Gilbert .
Riches were all very well ; but even Mrs. Rachel , practical soul though she was , did not consider them the one essential .
If Anne `` liked '' the Handsome Unknown better than Gilbert there was nothing more to be said ; but Mrs. Rachel was dreadfully afraid that Anne was going to make the mistake of marrying for money .
Marilla knew Anne too well to fear this ; but she felt that something in the universal scheme of things had gone sadly awry .
`` What is to be , will be , '' said Mrs. Rachel gloomily , `` and what is n't to be happens sometimes .
I ca n't help believing it 's going to happen in Anne 's case , if Providence does n't interfere , that 's what . ''
Mrs. Rachel sighed .
She was afraid Providence would n't interfere ; and she did n't dare to .
Anne had wandered down to the Dryad 's Bubble and was curled up among the ferns at the root of the big white birch where she and Gilbert had so often sat in summers gone by .
He had gone into the newspaper office again when college closed , and Avonlea seemed very dull without him .
He never wrote to her , and Anne missed the letters that never came .
To be sure , Roy wrote twice a week ; his letters were exquisite compositions which would have read beautifully in a memoir or biography .
Anne felt herself more deeply in love with him than ever when she read them ; but her heart never gave the queer , quick , painful bound at sight of his letters which it had given one day when Mrs. Hiram Sloane had handed her out an envelope addressed in Gilbert 's black , upright handwriting .
Anne had hurried home to the east gable and opened it eagerly -- to find a typewritten copy of some college society report -- `` only that and nothing more . ''
Anne flung the harmless screed across her room and sat down to write an especially nice epistle to Roy .
Diana was to be married in five more days .
The gray house at Orchard Slope was in a turmoil of baking and brewing and boiling and stewing , for there was to be a big , old-timey wedding .
Anne , of course , was to be bridesmaid , as had been arranged when they were twelve years old , and Gilbert was coming from Kingsport to be best man .
Anne was enjoying the excitement of the various preparations , but under it all she carried a little heartache .
She was , in a sense , losing her dear old chum ; Diana 's new home would be two miles from Green Gables , and the old constant companionship could never be theirs again .
Anne looked up at Diana 's light and thought how it had beaconed to her for many years ; but soon it would shine through the summer twilights no more .
Two big , painful tears welled up in her gray eyes .
`` Oh , '' she thought , `` how horrible it is that people have to grow up -- and marry -- and CHANGE ! ''
Chapter XXIX Diana 's Wedding `` After all , the only real roses are the pink ones , '' said Anne , as she tied white ribbon around Diana 's bouquet in the westward-looking gable at Orchard Slope .
`` They are the flowers of love and faith . ''
Diana was standing nervously in the middle of the room , arrayed in her bridal white , her black curls frosted over with the film of her wedding veil .
Anne had draped that veil , in accordance with the sentimental compact of years before .
`` It 's all pretty much as I used to imagine it long ago , when I wept over your inevitable marriage and our consequent parting , '' she laughed .
`` You are the bride of my dreams , Diana , with the ` lovely misty veil ' ; and I am YOUR bridesmaid .
But , alas !
I have n't the puffed sleeves -- though these short lace ones are even prettier .
Neither is my heart wholly breaking nor do I exactly hate Fred . ''
`` We are not really parting , Anne , '' protested Diana .
`` I 'm not going far away .
We 'll love each other just as much as ever .
We 've always kept that ` oath ' of friendship we swore long ago , have n't we ? ''
`` Yes .
We 've kept it faithfully .
We 've had a beautiful friendship , Diana .
We 've never marred it by one quarrel or coolness or unkind word ; and I hope it will always be so .
But things ca n't be quite the same after this .
You 'll have other interests .
I 'll just be on the outside .
But ` such is life ' as Mrs. Rachel says .
Mrs. Rachel has given you one of her beloved knitted quilts of the ` tobacco stripe ' pattern , and she says when I am married she 'll give me one , too . ''
`` The mean thing about your getting married is that I wo n't be able to be your bridesmaid , '' lamented Diana .
`` I 'm to be Phil 's bridesmaid next June , when she marries Mr. Blake , and then I must stop , for you know the proverb ` three times a bridesmaid , never a bride , ' '' said Anne , peeping through the window over the pink and snow of the blossoming orchard beneath .
`` Here comes the minister , Diana . ''
`` Oh , Anne , '' gasped Diana , suddenly turning very pale and beginning to tremble .
`` Oh , Anne -- I 'm so nervous -- I ca n't go through with it -- Anne , I know I 'm going to faint . ''
`` If you do I 'll drag you down to the rainwater hogshed and drop you in , '' said Anne unsympathetically .
`` Cheer up , dearest .
Getting married ca n't be so very terrible when so many people survive the ceremony .
See how cool and composed I am , and take courage . ''
`` Wait till your turn comes , Miss Anne .
Oh , Anne , I hear father coming upstairs .
Give me my bouquet .
Is my veil right ?
Am I very pale ? ''
`` You look just lovely .
Di , darling , kiss me good-bye for the last time .
Diana Barry will never kiss me again . ''
`` Diana Wright will , though .
There , mother 's calling .
Come . ''
Following the simple , old-fashioned way in vogue then , Anne went down to the parlor on Gilbert 's arm .
They met at the top of the stairs for the first time since they had left Kingsport , for Gilbert had arrived only that day .
Gilbert shook hands courteously .
He was looking very well , though , as Anne instantly noted , rather thin .
He was not pale ; there was a flush on his cheek that had burned into it as Anne came along the hall towards him , in her soft , white dress with lilies-of-the-valley in the shining masses of her hair .
As they entered the crowded parlor together a little murmur of admiration ran around the room .
`` What a fine-looking pair they are , '' whispered the impressible Mrs. Rachel to Marilla .
Fred ambled in alone , with a very red face , and then Diana swept in on her father 's arm .
She did not faint , and nothing untoward occurred to interrupt the ceremony .
Feasting and merry-making followed ; then , as the evening waned , Fred and Diana drove away through the moonlight to their new home , and Gilbert walked with Anne to Green Gables .
Something of their old comradeship had returned during the informal mirth of the evening .
Oh , it was nice to be walking over that well-known road with Gilbert again !
The night was so very still that one should have been able to hear the whisper of roses in blossom -- the laughter of daisies -- the piping of grasses -- many sweet sounds , all tangled up together .
The beauty of moonlight on familiar fields irradiated the world .
`` Ca n't we take a ramble up Lovers ' Lane before you go in ? ''
asked Gilbert as they crossed the bridge over the Lake of Shining Waters , in which the moon lay like a great , drowned blossom of gold .
Anne assented readily .
Lovers ' Lane was a veritable path in a fairyland that night -- a shimmering , mysterious place , full of wizardry in the white-woven enchantment of moonlight .
There had been a time when such a walk with Gilbert through Lovers ' Lane would have been far too dangerous .
But Roy and Christine had made it very safe now .
Anne found herself thinking a good deal about Christine as she chatted lightly to Gilbert .
She had met her several times before leaving Kingsport , and had been charmingly sweet to her .
Christine had also been charmingly sweet .
Indeed , they were a most cordial pair .
But for all that , their acquaintance had not ripened into friendship .
Evidently Christine was not a kindred spirit .
`` Are you going to be in Avonlea all summer ? ''
asked Gilbert .
`` No .
I 'm going down east to Valley Road next week .
Esther Haythorne wants me to teach for her through July and August .
They have a summer term in that school , and Esther is n't feeling well .
So I 'm going to substitute for her .
In one way I do n't mind .
Do you know , I 'm beginning to feel a little bit like a stranger in Avonlea now ?
It makes me sorry -- but it 's true .
It 's quite appalling to see the number of children who have shot up into big boys and girls -- really young men and women -- these past two years .
Half of my pupils are grown up .
It makes me feel awfully old to see them in the places you and I and our mates used to fill . ''
Anne laughed and sighed .
She felt very old and mature and wise -- which showed how young she was .
She told herself that she longed greatly to go back to those dear merry days when life was seen through a rosy mist of hope and illusion , and possessed an indefinable something that had passed away forever .
Where was it now -- the glory and the dream ? ''
` So wags the world away , ' '' quoted Gilbert practically , and a trifle absently .
Anne wondered if he were thinking of Christine .
Oh , Avonlea was going to be so lonely now -- with Diana gone !
Chapter XXX Mrs. Skinner 's Romance Anne stepped off the train at Valley Road station and looked about to see if any one had come to meet her .
She was to board with a certain Miss Janet Sweet , but she saw no one who answered in the least to her preconception of that lady , as formed from Esther 's letter .
The only person in sight was an elderly woman , sitting in a wagon with mail bags piled around her .
Two hundred would have been a charitable guess at her weight ; her face was as round and red as a harvest-moon and almost as featureless .
She wore a tight , black , cashmere dress , made in the fashion of ten years ago , a little dusty black straw hat trimmed with bows of yellow ribbon , and faded black lace mits .
`` Here , you , '' she called , waving her whip at Anne .
`` Are you the new Valley Road schoolma'am ? ''
`` Yes . ''
`` Well , I thought so .
Valley Road is noted for its good-looking schoolma'ams , just as Millersville is noted for its humly ones .
Janet Sweet asked me this morning if I could bring you out .
I said , ` Sartin I kin , if she do n't mind being scrunched up some .
This rig of mine 's kinder small for the mail bags and I 'm some heftier than Thomas ! '
Just wait , miss , till I shift these bags a bit and I 'll tuck you in somehow .
It 's only two miles to Janet 's .
Her next-door neighbor 's hired boy is coming for your trunk tonight .
My name is Skinner -- Amelia Skinner . ''
Anne was eventually tucked in , exchanging amused smiles with herself during the process .
`` Jog along , black mare , '' commanded Mrs. Skinner , gathering up the reins in her pudgy hands .
`` This is my first trip on the mail rowte .
Thomas wanted to hoe his turnips today so he asked me to come .
So I jest sot down and took a standing-up snack and started .
I sorter like it .
O ' course it 's rather tejus .
Part of the time I sits and thinks and the rest I jest sits .
Jog along , black mare .
I want to git home airly .
Thomas is terrible lonesome when I 'm away .
You see , we have n't been married very long . ''
`` Oh ! ''
said Anne politely .
`` Just a month .
Thomas courted me for quite a spell , though .
It was real romantic . ''
Anne tried to picture Mrs. Skinner on speaking terms with romance and failed .
`` Oh ? ''
she said again .
`` Yes .
Y ` see , there was another man after me .
Jog along , black mare .
I 'd been a widder so long folks had given up expecting me to marry again .
But when my darter -- she 's a schoolma'am like you -- went out West to teach I felt real lonesome and was n't nowise sot against the idea .
Bime-by Thomas began to come up and so did the other feller -- William Obadiah Seaman , his name was .
For a long time I could n't make up my mind which of them to take , and they kep ' coming and coming , and I kep ' worrying .
Y ` see , W.O. was rich -- he had a fine place and carried considerable style .
He was by far the best match .
Jog along , black mare . ''
`` Why did n't you marry him ? ''
asked Anne .
`` Well , y ` see , he did n't love me , '' answered Mrs. Skinner , solemnly .
Anne opened her eyes widely and looked at Mrs. Skinner .
But there was not a glint of humor on that lady 's face .
Evidently Mrs. Skinner saw nothing amusing in her own case .
`` He 'd been a widder-man for three yers , and his sister kept house for him .
Then she got married and he just wanted some one to look after his house .
It was worth looking after , too , mind you that .
It 's a handsome house .
Jog along , black mare .
As for Thomas , he was poor , and if his house did n't leak in dry weather it was about all that could be said for it , though it looks kind of pictureaskew .
But , y ` see , I loved Thomas , and I did n't care one red cent for W.O. .
So I argued it out with myself .
` Sarah Crowe , ' say I -- my first was a Crowe -- ` you can marry your rich man if you like but you wo n't be happy .
Folks ca n't get along together in this world without a little bit of love .
You 'd just better tie up to Thomas , for he loves you and you love him and nothing else ai n't going to do you . '
Jog along , black mare .
So I told Thomas I 'd take him .
All the time I was getting ready I never dared drive past W.O. 's place for fear the sight of that fine house of his would put me in the swithers again .
But now I never think of it at all , and I 'm just that comfortable and happy with Thomas .
Jog along , black mare . ''
`` How did William Obadiah take it ? ''
queried Anne .
`` Oh , he rumpussed a bit .
But he 's going to see a skinny old maid in Millersville now , and I guess she 'll take him fast enough .
She 'll make him a better wife than his first did .
W.O. never wanted to marry her .
He just asked her to marry him 'cause his father wanted him to , never dreaming but that she 'd say ` no . '
But mind you , she said ` yes . '
There was a predicament for you .
Jog along , black mare .
She was a great housekeeper , but most awful mean .
She wore the same bonnet for eighteen years .
Then she got a new one and W.O. met her on the road and did n't know her .
Jog along , black mare .
I feel that I 'd a narrer escape .
I might have married him and been most awful miserable , like my poor cousin , Jane Ann .
Jane Ann married a rich man she did n't care anything about , and she has n't the life of a dog .
She come to see me last week and says , says she , ` Sarah Skinner , I envy you .
I 'd rather live in a little hut on the side of the road with a man I was fond of than in my big house with the one I 've got . '
Jane Ann 's man ai n't such a bad sort , nuther , though he 's so contrary that he wears his fur coat when the thermometer 's at ninety .
The only way to git him to do anything is to coax him to do the opposite .
But there ai n't any love to smooth things down and it 's a poor way of living .
Jog along , black mare .
There 's Janet 's place in the hollow -- ` Wayside , ' she calls it .
Quite pictureaskew , ai n't it ?
I guess you 'll be glad to git out of this , with all them mail bags jamming round you . ''
`` Yes , but I have enjoyed my drive with you very much , '' said Anne sincerely .
`` Git away now ! ''
said Mrs. Skinner , highly flattered .
`` Wait till I tell Thomas that .
He always feels dretful tickled when I git a compliment .
Jog along , black mare .
Well , here we are .
I hope you 'll git on well in the school , miss .
There 's a short cut to it through the ma ` sh back of Janet 's .
If you take that way be awful keerful .
If you once got stuck in that black mud you 'd be sucked right down and never seen or heard tell of again till the day of judgment , like Adam Palmer 's cow .
Jog along , black mare . ''
Chapter XXXI Anne to Philippa `` Anne Shirley to Philippa Gordon , greeting .
`` Well-beloved , it 's high time I was writing you .
Here am I , installed once more as a country ` schoolma'am ' at Valley Road , boarding at ` Wayside , ' the home of Miss Janet Sweet .
Janet is a dear soul and very nicelooking ; tall , but not over-tall ; stoutish , yet with a certain restraint of outline suggestive of a thrifty soul who is not going to be overlavish even in the matter of avoirdupois .
She has a knot of soft , crimpy , brown hair with a thread of gray in it , a sunny face with rosy cheeks , and big , kind eyes as blue as forget-me-nots .
Moreover , she is one of those delightful , old-fashioned cooks who do n't care a bit if they ruin your digestion as long as they can give you feasts of fat things .
`` I like her ; and she likes me -- principally , it seems , because she had a sister named Anne who died young . ''
` I 'm real glad to see you , ' she said briskly , when I landed in her yard .
` My , you do n't look a mite like I expected .
I was sure you 'd be dark -- my sister Anne was dark .
And here you 're redheaded ! '
`` For a few minutes I thought I was n't going to like Janet as much as I had expected at first sight .
Then I reminded myself that I really must be more sensible than to be prejudiced against any one simply because she called my hair red .
Probably the word ` auburn ' was not in Janet 's vocabulary at all . ''
` Wayside ' is a dear sort of little spot .
The house is small and white , set down in a delightful little hollow that drops away from the road .
Between road and house is an orchard and flower-garden all mixed up together .
The front door walk is bordered with quahog clam-shells -- ` cow-hawks , ' Janet calls them ; there is Virginia Creeper over the porch and moss on the roof .
My room is a neat little spot ` off the parlor ' -- just big enough for the bed and me .
Over the head of my bed there is a picture of Robby Burns standing at Highland Mary 's grave , shadowed by an enormous weeping willow tree .
Robby 's face is so lugubrious that it is no wonder I have bad dreams .
Why , the first night I was here I dreamed I COULD N'T LAUGH .
`` The parlor is tiny and neat .
Its one window is so shaded by a huge willow that the room has a grotto-like effect of emerald gloom .
There are wonderful tidies on the chairs , and gay mats on the floor , and books and cards carefully arranged on a round table , and vases of dried grass on the mantel-piece .
Between the vases is a cheerful decoration of preserved coffin plates -- five in all , pertaining respectively to Janet 's father and mother , a brother , her sister Anne , and a hired man who died here once !
If I go suddenly insane some of these days ` know all men by these presents ' that those coffin-plates have caused it .
`` But it 's all delightful and I said so .
Janet loved me for it , just as she detested poor Esther because Esther had said so much shade was unhygienic and had objected to sleeping on a feather bed .
Now , I glory in feather-beds , and the more unhygienic and feathery they are the more I glory .
Janet says it is such a comfort to see me eat ; she had been so afraid I would be like Miss Haythorne , who would n't eat anything but fruit and hot water for breakfast and tried to make Janet give up frying things .
Esther is really a dear girl , but she is rather given to fads .
The trouble is that she has n't enough imagination and HAS a tendency to indigestion .
`` Janet told me I could have the use of the parlor when any young men called !
I do n't think there are many to call .
I have n't seen a young man in Valley Road yet , except the next-door hired boy -- Sam Toliver , a very tall , lank , tow-haired youth .
He came over one evening recently and sat for an hour on the garden fence , near the front porch where Janet and I were doing fancy-work .
The only remarks he volunteered in all that time were , ` Hev a peppermint , miss !
Dew now-fine thing for carARRH , peppermints , ' and , ` Powerful lot o ' jump-grasses round here ternight .
Yep . '
`` But there is a love affair going on here .
It seems to be my fortune to be mixed up , more or less actively , with elderly love affairs .
Mr. and Mrs. Irving always say that I brought about their marriage .
Mrs. Stephen Clark of Carmody persists in being most grateful to me for a suggestion which somebody else would probably have made if I had n't .
I do really think , though , that Ludovic Speed would never have got any further along than placid courtship if I had not helped him and Theodora Dix out .
`` In the present affair I am only a passive spectator .
I 've tried once to help things along and made an awful mess of it .
So I shall not meddle again .
I 'll tell you all about it when we meet . ''
Chapter XXXII Tea with Mrs. Douglas On the first Thursday night of Anne 's sojourn in Valley Road Janet asked her to go to prayer-meeting .
Janet blossomed out like a rose to attend that prayer-meeting .
She wore a pale-blue , pansy-sprinkled muslin dress with more ruffles than one would ever have supposed economical Janet could be guilty of , and a white leghorn hat with pink roses and three ostrich feathers on it .
Anne felt quite amazed .
Later on , she found out Janet 's motive in so arraying herself -- a motive as old as Eden .
Valley Road prayer-meetings seemed to be essentially feminine .
There were thirty-two women present , two half-grown boys , and one solitary man , beside the minister .
Anne found herself studying this man .
He was not handsome or young or graceful ; he had remarkably long legs -- so long that he had to keep them coiled up under his chair to dispose of them -- and he was stoop-shouldered .
His hands were big , his hair wanted barbering , and his moustache was unkempt .
But Anne thought she liked his face ; it was kind and honest and tender ; there was something else in it , too -- just what , Anne found it hard to define .
She finally concluded that this man had suffered and been strong , and it had been made manifest in his face .
There was a sort of patient , humorous endurance in his expression which indicated that he would go to the stake if need be , but would keep on looking pleasant until he really had to begin squirming .
When prayer-meeting was over this man came up to Janet and said , `` May I see you home , Janet ? ''
Janet took his arm -- `` as primly and shyly as if she were no more than sixteen , having her first escort home , '' Anne told the girls at Patty 's Place later on .
`` Miss Shirley , permit me to introduce Mr. Douglas , '' she said stiffly .
Mr. Douglas nodded and said , `` I was looking at you in prayer-meeting , miss , and thinking what a nice little girl you were . ''
Such a speech from ninety-nine people out of a hundred would have annoyed Anne bitterly ; but the way in which Mr. Douglas said it made her feel that she had received a very real and pleasing compliment .
She smiled appreciatively at him and dropped obligingly behind on the moonlit road .
So Janet had a beau !
Anne was delighted .
Janet would make a paragon of a wife -- cheery , economical , tolerant , and a very queen of cooks .
It would be a flagrant waste on Nature 's part to keep her a permanent old maid .
`` John Douglas asked me to take you up to see his mother , '' said Janet the next day .
`` She 's bed-rid a lot of the time and never goes out of the house .
But she 's powerful fond of company and always wants to see my boarders .
Can you go up this evening ? ''
Anne assented ; but later in the day Mr. Douglas called on his mother 's behalf to invite them up to tea on Saturday evening .
`` Oh , why did n't you put on your pretty pansy dress ? ''
asked Anne , when they left home .
It was a hot day , and poor Janet , between her excitement and her heavy black cashmere dress , looked as if she were being broiled alive .
`` Old Mrs. Douglas would think it terrible frivolous and unsuitable , I 'm afraid .
John likes that dress , though , '' she added wistfully .
The old Douglas homestead was half a mile from `` Wayside '' cresting a windy hill .
The house itself was large and comfortable , old enough to be dignified , and girdled with maple groves and orchards .
There were big , trim barns behind it , and everything bespoke prosperity .
Whatever the patient endurance in Mr. Douglas ' face had meant it had n't , so Anne reflected , meant debts and duns .
John Douglas met them at the door and took them into the sitting-room , where his mother was enthroned in an armchair .
Anne had expected old Mrs. Douglas to be tall and thin , because Mr. Douglas was .
Instead , she was a tiny scrap of a woman , with soft pink cheeks , mild blue eyes , and a mouth like a baby 's .
Dressed in a beautiful , fashionably-made black silk dress , with a fluffy white shawl over her shoulders , and her snowy hair surmounted by a dainty lace cap , she might have posed as a grandmother doll .
`` How do you do , Janet dear ? ''
she said sweetly .
`` I am so glad to see you again , dear . ''
She put up her pretty old face to be kissed .
`` And this is our new teacher .
I 'm delighted to meet you .
My son has been singing your praises until I 'm half jealous , and I 'm sure Janet ought to be wholly so . ''
Poor Janet blushed , Anne said something polite and conventional , and then everybody sat down and made talk .
It was hard work , even for Anne , for nobody seemed at ease except old Mrs. Douglas , who certainly did not find any difficulty in talking .
She made Janet sit by her and stroked her hand occasionally .
Janet sat and smiled , looking horribly uncomfortable in her hideous dress , and John Douglas sat without smiling .
At the tea table Mrs. Douglas gracefully asked Janet to pour the tea .
Janet turned redder than ever but did it .
Anne wrote a description of that meal to Stella .
`` We had cold tongue and chicken and strawberry preserves , lemon pie and tarts and chocolate cake and raisin cookies and pound cake and fruit cake -- and a few other things , including more pie -- caramel pie , I think it was .
After I had eaten twice as much as was good for me , Mrs. Douglas sighed and said she feared she had nothing to tempt my appetite . ''
` I 'm afraid dear Janet 's cooking has spoiled you for any other , ' she said sweetly .
` Of course nobody in Valley Road aspires to rival HER .
WO N'T you have another piece of pie , Miss Shirley ?
You have n't eaten ANYTHING . '
`` Stella , I had eaten a helping of tongue and one of chicken , three biscuits , a generous allowance of preserves , a piece of pie , a tart , and a square of chocolate cake ! ''
After tea Mrs. Douglas smiled benevolently and told John to take `` dear Janet '' out into the garden and get her some roses .
`` Miss Shirley will keep me company while you are out -- wo n't you ? ''
she said plaintively .
She settled down in her armchair with a sigh .
`` I am a very frail old woman , Miss Shirley .
For over twenty years I 've been a great sufferer .
For twenty long , weary years I 've been dying by inches . ''
`` How painful ! ''
said Anne , trying to be sympathetic and succeeding only in feeling idiotic .
`` There have been scores of nights when they 've thought I could never live to see the dawn , '' went on Mrs. Douglas solemnly .
`` Nobody knows what I 've gone through -- nobody can know but myself .
Well , it ca n't last very much longer now .
My weary pilgrimage will soon be over , Miss Shirley .
It is a great comfort to me that John will have such a good wife to look after him when his mother is gone -- a great comfort , Miss Shirley . ''
`` Janet is a lovely woman , '' said Anne warmly .
`` Lovely !
A beautiful character , '' assented Mrs. Douglas .
`` And a perfect housekeeper -- something I never was .
My health would not permit it , Miss Shirley .
I am indeed thankful that John has made such a wise choice .
I hope and believe that he will be happy .
He is my only son , Miss Shirley , and his happiness lies very near my heart . ''
`` Of course , '' said Anne stupidly .
For the first time in her life she was stupid .
Yet she could not imagine why .
She seemed to have absolutely nothing to say to this sweet , smiling , angelic old lady who was patting her hand so kindly .
`` Come and see me soon again , dear Janet , '' said Mrs. Douglas lovingly , when they left .
`` You do n't come half often enough .
But then I suppose John will be bringing you here to stay all the time one of these days . ''
Anne , happening to glance at John Douglas , as his mother spoke , gave a positive start of dismay .
He looked as a tortured man might look when his tormentors gave the rack the last turn of possible endurance .
She felt sure he must be ill and hurried poor blushing Janet away .
`` Is n't old Mrs. Douglas a sweet woman ? ''
asked Janet , as they went down the road .
`` M -- m , '' answered Anne absently .
She was wondering why John Douglas had looked so .
`` She 's been a terrible sufferer , '' said Janet feelingly .
`` She takes terrible spells .
It keeps John all worried up .
He 's scared to leave home for fear his mother will take a spell and nobody there but the hired girl . ''
Chapter XXXIII `` He Just Kept Coming and Coming '' Three days later Anne came home from school and found Janet crying .
Tears and Janet seemed so incongruous that Anne was honestly alarmed .
`` Oh , what is the matter ? ''
she cried anxiously .
`` I 'm -- I 'm forty today , '' sobbed Janet .
`` Well , you were nearly that yesterday and it did n't hurt , '' comforted Anne , trying not to smile .
`` But -- but , '' went on Janet with a big gulp , `` John Douglas wo n't ask me to marry him . ''
`` Oh , but he will , '' said Anne lamely .
`` You must give him time , Janet `` Time ! ''
said Janet with indescribable scorn .
`` He has had twenty years .
How much time does he want ? ''
`` Do you mean that John Douglas has been coming to see you for twenty years ? ''
`` He has .
And he has never so much as mentioned marriage to me .
And I do n't believe he ever will now .
I 've never said a word to a mortal about it , but it seems to me I 've just got to talk it out with some one at last or go crazy .
John Douglas begun to go with me twenty years ago , before mother died .
Well , he kept coming and coming , and after a spell I begun making quilts and things ; but he never said anything about getting married , only just kept coming and coming .
There was n't anything I could do .
Mother died when we 'd been going together for eight years .
I thought he maybe would speak out then , seeing as I was left alone in the world .
He was real kind and feeling , and did everything he could for me , but he never said marry .
And that 's the way it has been going on ever since .
People blame ME for it .
They say I wo n't marry him because his mother is so sickly and I do n't want the bother of waiting on her .
Why , I 'd LOVE to wait on John 's mother !
But I let them think so .
I 'd rather they 'd blame me than pity me !
It 's so dreadful humiliating that John wo n't ask me .
And WHY wo n't he ?
Seems to me if I only knew his reason I would n't mind it so much . ''
`` Perhaps his mother does n't want him to marry anybody , '' suggested Anne .
`` Oh , she does .
She 's told me time and again that she 'd love to see John settled before her time comes .
She 's always giving him hints -- you heard her yourself the other day .
I thought I 'd ha ' gone through the floor . ''
`` It 's beyond me , '' said Anne helplessly .
She thought of Ludovic Speed .
But the cases were not parallel .
John Douglas was not a man of Ludovic 's type .
`` You should show more spirit , Janet , '' she went on resolutely .
`` Why did n't you send him about his business long ago ? ''
`` I could n't , '' said poor Janet pathetically .
`` You see , Anne , I 've always been awful fond of John .
He might just as well keep coming as not , for there was never anybody else I 'd want , so it did n't matter . ''
`` But it might have made him speak out like a man , '' urged Anne .
Janet shook her head .
`` No , I guess not .
I was afraid to try , anyway , for fear he 'd think I meant it and just go .
I suppose I 'm a poor-spirited creature , but that is how I feel .
And I ca n't help it . ''
`` Oh , you COULD help it , Janet .
It is n't too late yet .
Take a firm stand .
Let that man know you are not going to endure his shillyshallying any longer .
I 'LL back you up . ''
`` I dunno , '' said Janet hopelessly .
`` I dunno if I could ever get up enough spunk .
Things have drifted so long .
But I 'll think it over . ''
Anne felt that she was disappointed in John Douglas .
She had liked him so well , and she had not thought him the sort of man who would play fast and loose with a woman 's feelings for twenty years .
He certainly should be taught a lesson , and Anne felt vindictively that she would enjoy seeing the process .
Therefore she was delighted when Janet told her , as they were going to prayer-meeting the next night , that she meant to show some `` sperrit . ''
`` I 'll let John Douglas see I 'm not going to be trodden on any longer . ''
`` You are perfectly right , '' said Anne emphatically .
When prayer-meeting was over John Douglas came up with his usual request .
Janet looked frightened but resolute .
`` No , thank you , '' she said icily .
`` I know the road home pretty well alone .
I ought to , seeing I 've been traveling it for forty years .
So you need n't trouble yourself , MR. Douglas . ''
Anne was looking at John Douglas ; and , in that brilliant moonlight , she saw the last twist of the rack again .
Without a word he turned and strode down the road .
`` Stop !
Stop ! ''
Anne called wildly after him , not caring in the least for the other dumbfounded onlookers .
`` Mr. Douglas , stop !
Come back . ''
John Douglas stopped but he did not come back .
Anne flew down the road , caught his arm and fairly dragged him back to Janet .
`` You must come back , '' she said imploringly .
`` It 's all a mistake , Mr. Douglas -- all my fault .
I made Janet do it .
She did n't want to -- but it 's all right now , is n't it , Janet ? ''
Without a word Janet took his arm and walked away .
Anne followed them meekly home and slipped in by the back door .
`` Well , you are a nice person to back me up , '' said Janet sarcastically .
`` I could n't help it , Janet , '' said Anne repentantly .
`` I just felt as if I had stood by and seen murder done .
I HAD to run after him . ''
`` Oh , I 'm just as glad you did .
When I saw John Douglas making off down that road I just felt as if every little bit of joy and happiness that was left in my life was going with him .
It was an awful feeling . ''
`` Did he ask you why you did it ? ''
asked Anne .
`` No , he never said a word about it , '' replied Janet dully .
Chapter XXXIV John Douglas Speaks at Last Anne was not without a feeble hope that something might come of it after all .
But nothing did .
John Douglas came and took Janet driving , and walked home from prayer-meeting with her , as he had been doing for twenty years , and as he seemed likely to do for twenty years more .
The summer waned .
Anne taught her school and wrote letters and studied a little .
Her walks to and from school were pleasant .
She always went by way of the swamp ; it was a lovely place -- a boggy soil , green with the greenest of mossy hillocks ; a silvery brook meandered through it and spruces stood erectly , their boughs a-trail with gray-green mosses , their roots overgrown with all sorts of woodland lovelinesses .
Nevertheless , Anne found life in Valley Road a little monotonous .
To be sure , there was one diverting incident .
She had not seen the lank , tow-headed Samuel of the peppermints since the evening of his call , save for chance meetings on the road .
But one warm August night he appeared , and solemnly seated himself on the rustic bench by the porch .
He wore his usual working habiliments , consisting of varipatched trousers , a blue jean shirt , out at the elbows , and a ragged straw hat .
He was chewing a straw and he kept on chewing it while he looked solemnly at Anne .
Anne laid her book aside with a sigh and took up her doily .
Conversation with Sam was really out of the question .
After a long silence Sam suddenly spoke .
`` I 'm leaving over there , '' he said abruptly , waving his straw in the direction of the neighboring house .
`` Oh , are you ? ''
said Anne politely .
`` Yep . ''
`` And where are you going now ? ''
`` Wall , I 've been thinking some of gitting a place of my own .
There 's one that 'd suit me over at Millersville .
But ef I rents it I 'll want a woman . ''
`` I suppose so , '' said Anne vaguely .
`` Yep . ''
There was another long silence .
Finally Sam removed his straw again and said , `` Will yeh hev me ? ''
`` Wh -- a -- t ! ''
gasped Anne .
`` Will yeh hev me ? ''
`` Do you mean -- MARRY you ? ''
queried poor Anne feebly .
`` Yep . ''
`` Why , I 'm hardly acquainted with you , '' cried Anne indignantly .
`` But yeh 'd git acquainted with me after we was married , '' said Sam .
Anne gathered up her poor dignity .
`` Certainly I wo n't marry you , '' she said haughtily .
`` Wall , yeh might do worse , '' expostulated Sam .
`` I 'm a good worker and I 've got some money in the bank . ''
`` Do n't speak of this to me again .
Whatever put such an idea into your head ? ''
said Anne , her sense of humor getting the better of her wrath .
It was such an absurd situation .
`` Yeh 're a likely-looking girl and hev a right-smart way o ' stepping , '' said Sam .
`` I do n't want no lazy woman .
Think it over .
I wo n't change my mind yit awhile .
Wall , I must be gitting .
Gotter milk the cows . ''
Anne 's illusions concerning proposals had suffered so much of late years that there were few of them left .
So she could laugh wholeheartedly over this one , not feeling any secret sting .
She mimicked poor Sam to Janet that night , and both of them laughed immoderately over his plunge into sentiment .
One afternoon , when Anne 's sojourn in Valley Road was drawing to a close , Alec Ward came driving down to `` Wayside '' in hot haste for Janet .
`` They want you at the Douglas place quick , '' he said .
`` I really believe old Mrs. Douglas is going to die at last , after pretending to do it for twenty years . ''
Janet ran to get her hat .
Anne asked if Mrs. Douglas was worse than usual .
`` She 's not half as bad , '' said Alec solemnly , `` and that 's what makes me think it 's serious .
Other times she 'd be screaming and throwing herself all over the place .
This time she 's lying still and mum .
When Mrs. Douglas is mum she is pretty sick , you bet . ''
`` You do n't like old Mrs. Douglas ? ''
said Anne curiously .
`` I like cats as IS cats .
I do n't like cats as is women , '' was Alec 's cryptic reply .
Janet came home in the twilight .
`` Mrs. Douglas is dead , '' she said wearily .
`` She died soon after I got there .
She just spoke to me once -- ' I suppose you 'll marry John now ? '
she said .
It cut me to the heart , Anne .
To think John 's own mother thought I would n't marry him because of her !
I could n't say a word either -- there were other women there .
I was thankful John had gone out . ''
Janet began to cry drearily .
But Anne brewed her a hot drink of ginger tea to her comforting .
To be sure , Anne discovered later on that she had used white pepper instead of ginger ; but Janet never knew the difference .
The evening after the funeral Janet and Anne were sitting on the front porch steps at sunset .
The wind had fallen asleep in the pinelands and lurid sheets of heat-lightning flickered across the northern skies .
Janet wore her ugly black dress and looked her very worst , her eyes and nose red from crying .
They talked little , for Janet seemed faintly to resent Anne 's efforts to cheer her up .
She plainly preferred to be miserable .
Suddenly the gate-latch clicked and John Douglas strode into the garden .
He walked towards them straight over the geranium bed .
Janet stood up .
So did Anne .
Anne was a tall girl and wore a white dress ; but John Douglas did not see her .
`` Janet , '' he said , `` will you marry me ? ''
The words burst out as if they had been wanting to be said for twenty years and MUST be uttered now , before anything else .
Janet 's face was so red from crying that it could n't turn any redder , so it turned a most unbecoming purple .
`` Why did n't you ask me before ? ''
she said slowly .
`` I could n't .
She made me promise not to -- mother made me promise not to .
Nineteen years ago she took a terrible spell .
We thought she could n't live through it .
She implored me to promise not to ask you to marry me while she was alive .
I did n't want to promise such a thing , even though we all thought she could n't live very long -- the doctor only gave her six months .
But she begged it on her knees , sick and suffering .
I had to promise . ''
`` What had your mother against me ? ''
cried Janet .
`` Nothing -- nothing .
She just did n't want another woman -- ANY woman -- there while she was living .
She said if I did n't promise she 'd die right there and I 'd have killed her .
So I promised .
And she 's held me to that promise ever since , though I 've gone on my knees to her in my turn to beg her to let me off . ''
`` Why did n't you tell me this ? ''
asked Janet chokingly .
`` If I 'd only KNOWN !
Why did n't you just tell me ? ''
`` She made me promise I would n't tell a soul , '' said John hoarsely .
`` She swore me to it on the Bible ; Janet , I 'd never have done it if I 'd dreamed it was to be for so long .
Janet , you 'll never know what I 've suffered these nineteen years .
I know I 've made you suffer , too , but you 'll marry me for all , wo n't you , Janet ?
Oh , Janet , wo n't you ?
I 've come as soon as I could to ask you . ''
At this moment the stupefied Anne came to her senses and realized that she had no business to be there .
She slipped away and did not see Janet until the next morning , when the latter told her the rest of the story .
`` That cruel , relentless , deceitful old woman ! ''
cried Anne .
`` Hush -- she 's dead , '' said Janet solemnly .
`` If she was n't -- but she IS .
So we must n't speak evil of her .
But I 'm happy at last , Anne .
And I would n't have minded waiting so long a bit if I 'd only known why . ''
`` When are you to be married ? ''
`` Next month .
Of course it will be very quiet .
I suppose people will talk terrible .
They 'll say I made enough haste to snap John up as soon as his poor mother was out of the way .
John wanted to let them know the truth but I said , ` No , John ; after all she was your mother , and we 'll keep the secret between us , and not cast any shadow on her memory .
I do n't mind what people say , now that I know the truth myself .
It do n't matter a mite .
Let it all be buried with the dead ' says I to him .
So I coaxed him round to agree with me . ''
`` You 're much more forgiving than I could ever be , '' Anne said , rather crossly .
`` You 'll feel differently about a good many things when you get to be my age , '' said Janet tolerantly .
`` That 's one of the things we learn as we grow older -- how to forgive .
It comes easier at forty than it did at twenty . ''
Chapter XXXV The Last Redmond Year Opens `` Here we are , all back again , nicely sunburned and rejoicing as a strong man to run a race , '' said Phil , sitting down on a suitcase with a sigh of pleasure .
`` Is n't it jolly to see this dear old Patty 's Place again -- and Aunty -- and the cats ?
Rusty has lost another piece of ear , has n't he ? ''
`` Rusty would be the nicest cat in the world if he had no ears at all , '' declared Anne loyally from her trunk , while Rusty writhed about her lap in a frenzy of welcome .
`` Are n't you glad to see us back , Aunty ? ''
demanded Phil .
`` Yes .
But I wish you 'd tidy things up , '' said Aunt Jamesina plaintively , looking at the wilderness of trunks and suitcases by which the four laughing , chattering girls were surrounded .
`` You can talk just as well later on .
Work first and then play used to be my motto when I was a girl . ''
`` Oh , we 've just reversed that in this generation , Aunty .
OUR motto is play your play and then dig in .
You can do your work so much better if you 've had a good bout of play first . ''
`` If you are going to marry a minister , '' said Aunt Jamesina , picking up Joseph and her knitting and resigning herself to the inevitable with the charming grace that made her the queen of housemothers , `` you will have to give up such expressions as ` dig in . ' ''
`` Why ? ''
moaned Phil .
`` Oh , why must a minister 's wife be supposed to utter only prunes and prisms ?
I sha n't .
Everybody on Patterson Street uses slang -- that is to say , metaphorical language -- and if I did n't they would think me insufferably proud and stuck up . ''
`` Have you broken the news to your family ? ''
asked Priscilla , feeding the Sarah-cat bits from her lunchbasket .
Phil nodded .
`` How did they take it ? ''
`` Oh , mother rampaged .
But I stood rockfirm -- even I , Philippa Gordon , who never before could hold fast to anything .
Father was calmer .
Father 's own daddy was a minister , so you see he has a soft spot in his heart for the cloth .
I had Jo up to Mount Holly , after mother grew calm , and they both loved him .
But mother gave him some frightful hints in every conversation regarding what she had hoped for me .
Oh , my vacation pathway has n't been exactly strewn with roses , girls dear .
But -- I 've won out and I 've got Jo .
Nothing else matters . ''
`` To you , '' said Aunt Jamesina darkly .
`` Nor to Jo , either , '' retorted Phil .
`` You keep on pitying him .
Why , pray ?
I think he 's to be envied .
He 's getting brains , beauty , and a heart of gold in ME . ''
`` It 's well we know how to take your speeches , '' said Aunt Jamesina patiently .
`` I hope you do n't talk like that before strangers .
What would they think ? ''
`` Oh , I do n't want to know what they think .
I do n't want to see myself as others see me .
I 'm sure it would be horribly uncomfortable most of the time .
I do n't believe Burns was really sincere in that prayer , either . ''
`` Oh , I daresay we all pray for some things that we really do n't want , if we were only honest enough to look into our hearts , '' owned Aunt Jamesina candidly .
`` I 've a notion that such prayers do n't rise very far .
I used to pray that I might be enabled to forgive a certain person , but I know now I really did n't want to forgive her .
When I finally got that I DID want to I forgave her without having to pray about it . ''
`` I ca n't picture you as being unforgiving for long , '' said Stella .
`` Oh , I used to be .
But holding spite does n't seem worth while when you get along in years . ''
`` That reminds me , '' said Anne , and told the tale of John and Janet .
`` And now tell us about that romantic scene you hinted so darkly at in one of your letters , '' demanded Phil .
Anne acted out Samuel 's proposal with great spirit .
The girls shrieked with laughter and Aunt Jamesina smiled .
`` It is n't in good taste to make fun of your beaux , '' she said severely ; `` but , '' she added calmly , `` I always did it myself . ''
`` Tell us about your beaux , Aunty , '' entreated Phil .
`` You must have had any number of them . ''
`` They 're not in the past tense , '' retorted Aunt Jamesina .
`` I 've got them yet .
There are three old widowers at home who have been casting sheep 's eyes at me for some time .
You children need n't think you own all the romance in the world . ''
`` Widowers and sheep 's eyes do n't sound very romantic , Aunty . ''
`` Well , no ; but young folks are n't always romantic either .
Some of my beaux certainly were n't .
I used to laugh at them scandalous , poor boys .
There was Jim Elwood -- he was always in a sort of day-dream -- never seemed to sense what was going on .
He did n't wake up to the fact that I 'd said ` no ' till a year after I 'd said it .
When he did get married his wife fell out of the sleigh one night when they were driving home from church and he never missed her .
Then there was Dan Winston .
He knew too much .
He knew everything in this world and most of what is in the next .
He could give you an answer to any question , even if you asked him when the Judgment Day was to be .
Milton Edwards was real nice and I liked him but I did n't marry him .
For one thing , he took a week to get a joke through his head , and for another he never asked me .
Horatio Reeve was the most interesting beau I ever had .
But when he told a story he dressed it up so that you could n't see it for frills .
I never could decide whether he was lying or just letting his imagination run loose . ''
`` And what about the others , Aunty ? ''
`` Go away and unpack , '' said Aunt Jamesina , waving Joseph at them by mistake for a needle .
`` The others were too nice to make fun of .
I shall respect their memory .
There 's a box of flowers in your room , Anne .
They came about an hour ago . ''
After the first week the girls of Patty 's Place settled down to a steady grind of study ; for this was their last year at Redmond and graduation honors must be fought for persistently .
Anne devoted herself to English , Priscilla pored over classics , and Philippa pounded away at Mathematics .
Sometimes they grew tired , sometimes they felt discouraged , sometimes nothing seemed worth the struggle for it .
In one such mood Stella wandered up to the blue room one rainy November evening .
Anne sat on the floor in a little circle of light cast by the lamp beside her , amid a surrounding snow of crumpled manuscript .
`` What in the world are you doing ? ''
`` Just looking over some old Story Club yarns .
I wanted something to cheer AND inebriate .
I 'd studied until the world seemed azure .
So I came up here and dug these out of my trunk .
They are so drenched in tears and tragedy that they are excruciatingly funny . ''
`` I 'm blue and discouraged myself , '' said Stella , throwing herself on the couch .
`` Nothing seems worthwhile .
My very thoughts are old .
I 've thought them all before .
What is the use of living after all , Anne ? ''
`` Honey , it 's just brain fag that makes us feel that way , and the weather .
A pouring rainy night like this , coming after a hard day 's grind , would squelch any one but a Mark Tapley .
You know it IS worthwhile to live . ''
`` Oh , I suppose so .
But I ca n't prove it to myself just now . ''
`` Just think of all the great and noble souls who have lived and worked in the world , '' said Anne dreamily .
`` Is n't it worthwhile to come after them and inherit what they won and taught ?
Is n't it worthwhile to think we can share their inspiration ?
And then , all the great souls that will come in the future ?
Is n't it worthwhile to work a little and prepare the way for them -- make just one step in their path easier ? ''
`` Oh , my mind agrees with you , Anne .
But my soul remains doleful and uninspired .
I 'm always grubby and dingy on rainy nights . ''
`` Some nights I like the rain -- I like to lie in bed and hear it pattering on the roof and drifting through the pines . ''
`` I like it when it stays on the roof , '' said Stella .
`` It does n't always .
I spent a gruesome night in an old country farmhouse last summer .
The roof leaked and the rain came pattering down on my bed .
There was no poetry in THAT .
I had to get up in the ` mirk midnight ' and chivy round to pull the bedstead out of the drip -- and it was one of those solid , old-fashioned beds that weigh a ton -- more or less .
And then that drip-drop , drip-drop kept up all night until my nerves just went to pieces .
You 've no idea what an eerie noise a great drop of rain falling with a mushy thud on a bare floor makes in the night .
It sounds like ghostly footsteps and all that sort of thing .
What are you laughing over , Anne ? ''
`` These stories .
As Phil would say they are killing -- in more senses than one , for everybody died in them .
What dazzlingly lovely heroines we had -- and how we dressed them !
`` Silks -- satins -- velvets -- jewels -- laces -- they never wore anything else .
Here is one of Jane Andrews ' stories depicting her heroine as sleeping in a beautiful white satin nightdress trimmed with seed pearls . ''
`` Go on , '' said Stella .
`` I begin to feel that life is worth living as long as there 's a laugh in it . ''
`` Here 's one I wrote .
My heroine is disporting herself at a ball ` glittering from head to foot with large diamonds of the first water . '
But what booted beauty or rich attire ?
` The paths of glory lead but to the grave . '
They must either be murdered or die of a broken heart .
There was no escape for them . ''
`` Let me read some of your stories . ''
`` Well , here 's my masterpiece .
Note its cheerful title -- ` My Graves . '
I shed quarts of tears while writing it , and the other girls shed gallons while I read it .
Jane Andrews ' mother scolded her frightfully because she had so many handkerchiefs in the wash that week .
It 's a harrowing tale of the wanderings of a Methodist minister 's wife .
I made her a Methodist because it was necessary that she should wander .
She buried a child every place she lived in .
There were nine of them and their graves were severed far apart , ranging from Newfoundland to Vancouver .
I described the children , pictured their several death beds , and detailed their tombstones and epitaphs .
I had intended to bury the whole nine but when I had disposed of eight my invention of horrors gave out and I permitted the ninth to live as a hopeless cripple . ''
While Stella read My Graves , punctuating its tragic paragraphs with chuckles , and Rusty slept the sleep of a just cat who has been out all night curled up on a Jane Andrews tale of a beautiful maiden of fifteen who went to nurse in a leper colony -- of course dying of the loathsome disease finally -- Anne glanced over the other manuscripts and recalled the old days at Avonlea school when the members of the Story Club , sitting under the spruce trees or down among the ferns by the brook , had written them .
What fun they had had !
How the sunshine and mirth of those olden summers returned as she read .
Not all the glory that was Greece or the grandeur that was Rome could weave such wizardry as those funny , tearful tales of the Story Club .
Among the manuscripts Anne found one written on sheets of wrapping paper .
A wave of laughter filled her gray eyes as she recalled the time and place of its genesis .
It was the sketch she had written the day she fell through the roof of the Cobb duckhouse on the Tory Road .
Anne glanced over it , then fell to reading it intently .
It was a little dialogue between asters and sweet-peas , wild canaries in the lilac bush , and the guardian spirit of the garden .
After she had read it , she sat , staring into space ; and when Stella had gone she smoothed out the crumpled manuscript .
`` I believe I will , '' she said resolutely .
Chapter XXXVI The Gardners ` Call `` Here is a letter with an Indian stamp for you , Aunt Jimsie , '' said Phil .
`` Here are three for Stella , and two for Pris , and a glorious fat one for me from Jo .
There 's nothing for you , Anne , except a circular . ''
Nobody noticed Anne 's flush as she took the thin letter Phil tossed her carelessly .
But a few minutes later Phil looked up to see a transfigured Anne .
`` Honey , what good thing has happened ? ''
`` The Youth 's Friend has accepted a little sketch I sent them a fortnight ago , '' said Anne , trying hard to speak as if she were accustomed to having sketches accepted every mail , but not quite succeeding .
`` Anne Shirley !
How glorious !
What was it ?
When is it to be published ?
Did they pay you for it ? ''
`` Yes ; they 've sent a check for ten dollars , and the editor writes that he would like to see more of my work .
Dear man , he shall .
It was an old sketch I found in my box .
I re-wrote it and sent it in -- but I never really thought it could be accepted because it had no plot , '' said Anne , recalling the bitter experience of Averil 's Atonement .
`` What are you going to do with that ten dollars , Anne ?
Let 's all go up town and get drunk , '' suggested Phil .
`` I AM going to squander it in a wild soulless revel of some sort , '' declared Anne gaily .
`` At all events it is n't tainted money -- like the check I got for that horrible Reliable Baking Powder story .
I spent IT usefully for clothes and hated them every time I put them on . ''
`` Think of having a real live author at Patty 's Place , '' said Priscilla .
`` It 's a great responsibility , '' said Aunt Jamesina solemnly .
`` Indeed it is , '' agreed Pris with equal solemnity .
`` Authors are kittle cattle .
You never know when or how they will break out .
Anne may make copy of us . ''
`` I meant that the ability to write for the Press was a great responsibility , '' said Aunt Jamesina severely , `` and I hope Anne realizes , it .
My daughter used to write stories before she went to the foreign field , but now she has turned her attention to higher things .
She used to say her motto was ` Never write a line you would be ashamed to read at your own funeral . '
You 'd better take that for yours , Anne , if you are going to embark in literature .
Though , to be sure , '' added Aunt Jamesina perplexedly , `` Elizabeth always used to laugh when she said it .
She always laughed so much that I do n't know how she ever came to decide on being a missionary .
I 'm thankful she did -- I prayed that she might -- but -- I wish she had n't . ''
Then Aunt Jamesina wondered why those giddy girls all laughed .
Anne 's eyes shone all that day ; literary ambitions sprouted and budded in her brain ; their exhilaration accompanied her to Jennie Cooper 's walking party , and not even the sight of Gilbert and Christine , walking just ahead of her and Roy , could quite subdue the sparkle of her starry hopes .
Nevertheless , she was not so rapt from things of earth as to be unable to notice that Christine 's walk was decidedly ungraceful .
`` But I suppose Gilbert looks only at her face .
So like a man , '' thought Anne scornfully .
`` Shall you be home Saturday afternoon ? ''
asked Roy .
`` Yes . ''
`` My mother and sisters are coming to call on you , '' said Roy quietly .
Something went over Anne which might be described as a thrill , but it was hardly a pleasant one .
She had never met any of Roy 's family ; she realized the significance of his statement ; and it had , somehow , an irrevocableness about it that chilled her .
`` I shall be glad to see them , '' she said flatly ; and then wondered if she really would be glad .
She ought to be , of course .
But would it not be something of an ordeal ?
Gossip had filtered to Anne regarding the light in which the Gardners viewed the `` infatuation '' of son and brother .
Roy must have brought pressure to bear in the matter of this call .
Anne knew she would be weighed in the balance .
From the fact that they had consented to call she understood that , willingly or unwillingly , they regarded her as a possible member of their clan .
`` I shall just be myself .
I shall not TRY to make a good impression , '' thought Anne loftily .
But she was wondering what dress she would better wear Saturday afternoon , and if the new style of high hair-dressing would suit her better than the old ; and the walking party was rather spoiled for her .
By night she had decided that she would wear her brown chiffon on Saturday , but would do her hair low .
Friday afternoon none of the girls had classes at Redmond .
Stella took the opportunity to write a paper for the Philomathic Society , and was sitting at the table in the corner of the living-room with an untidy litter of notes and manuscript on the floor around her .
Stella always vowed she never could write anything unless she threw each sheet down as she completed it .
Anne , in her flannel blouse and serge skirt , with her hair rather blown from her windy walk home , was sitting squarely in the middle of the floor , teasing the Sarah-cat with a wishbone .
Joseph and Rusty were both curled up in her lap .
A warm plummy odor filled the whole house , for Priscilla was cooking in the kitchen .
Presently she came in , enshrouded in a huge work-apron , with a smudge of flour on her nose , to show Aunt Jamesina the chocolate cake she had just iced .
At this auspicious moment the knocker sounded .
Nobody paid any attention to it save Phil , who sprang up and opened it , expecting a boy with the hat she had bought that morning .
On the doorstep stood Mrs. Gardner and her daughters .
Anne scrambled to her feet somehow , emptying two indignant cats out of her lap as she did so , and mechanically shifting her wishbone from her right hand to her left .
Priscilla , who would have had to cross the room to reach the kitchen door , lost her head , wildly plunged the chocolate cake under a cushion on the inglenook sofa , and dashed upstairs .
Stella began feverishly gathering up her manuscript .
Only Aunt Jamesina and Phil remained normal .
Thanks to them , everybody was soon sitting at ease , even Anne .
Priscilla came down , apronless and smudgeless , Stella reduced her corner to decency , and Phil saved the situation by a stream of ready small talk .
Mrs. Gardner was tall and thin and handsome , exquisitely gowned , cordial with a cordiality that seemed a trifle forced .
Aline Gardner was a younger edition of her mother , lacking the cordiality .
She endeavored to be nice , but succeeded only in being haughty and patronizing .
Dorothy Gardner was slim and jolly and rather tomboyish .
Anne knew she was Roy 's favorite sister and warmed to her .
She would have looked very much like Roy if she had had dreamy dark eyes instead of roguish hazel ones .
Thanks to her and Phil , the call really went off very well , except for a slight sense of strain in the atmosphere and two rather untoward incidents .
Rusty and Joseph , left to themselves , began a game of chase , and sprang madly into Mrs. Gardner 's silken lap and out of it in their wild career .
Mrs. Gardner lifted her lorgnette and gazed after their flying forms as if she had never seen cats before , and Anne , choking back slightly nervous laughter , apologized as best she could .
`` You are fond of cats ? ''
said Mrs. Gardner , with a slight intonation of tolerant wonder .
Anne , despite her affection for Rusty , was not especially fond of cats , but Mrs. Gardner 's tone annoyed her .
Inconsequently she remembered that Mrs. John Blythe was so fond of cats that she kept as many as her husband would allow .
`` They ARE adorable animals , are n't they ? ''
she said wickedly .
`` I have never liked cats , '' said Mrs. Gardner remotely .
`` I love them , '' said Dorothy .
`` They are so nice and selfish .
Dogs are TOO good and unselfish .
They make me feel uncomfortable .
But cats are gloriously human . ''
`` You have two delightful old china dogs there .
May I look at them closely ? ''
said Aline , crossing the room towards the fireplace and thereby becoming the unconscious cause of the other accident .
Picking up Magog , she sat down on the cushion under which was secreted Priscilla 's chocolate cake .
Priscilla and Anne exchanged agonized glances but could do nothing .
The stately Aline continued to sit on the cushion and discuss china dogs until the time of departure .
Dorothy lingered behind a moment to squeeze Anne 's hand and whisper impulsively .
`` I KNOW you and I are going to be chums .
Oh , Roy has told me all about you .
I 'm the only one of the family he tells things to , poor boy -- nobody COULD confide in mamma and Aline , you know .
What glorious times you girls must have here !
Wo n't you let me come often and have a share in them ? ''
`` Come as often as you like , '' Anne responded heartily , thankful that one of Roy 's sisters was likable .
She would never like Aline , so much was certain ; and Aline would never like her , though Mrs. Gardner might be won .
Altogether , Anne sighed with relief when the ordeal was over . ''
` Of all sad words of tongue or pen The saddest are it might have been , ' '' quoted Priscilla tragically , lifting the cushion .
`` This cake is now what you might call a flat failure .
And the cushion is likewise ruined .
Never tell me that Friday is n't unlucky . ''
`` People who send word they are coming on Saturday should n't come on Friday , '' said Aunt Jamesina .
`` I fancy it was Roy 's mistake , '' said Phil .
`` That boy is n't really responsible for what he says when he talks to Anne .
Where IS Anne ? ''
Anne had gone upstairs .
She felt oddly like crying .
But she made herself laugh instead .
Rusty and Joseph had been TOO awful !
And Dorothy WAS a dear .
Chapter XXXVII Full-fledged B.A. 's `` I wish I were dead , or that it were tomorrow night , '' groaned Phil .
`` If you live long enough both wishes will come true , '' said Anne calmly .
`` It 's easy for you to be serene .
You 're at home in Philosophy .
I 'm not -- and when I think of that horrible paper tomorrow I quail .
If I should fail in it what would Jo say ? ''
`` You wo n't fail .
How did you get on in Greek today ? ''
`` I do n't know .
Perhaps it was a good paper and perhaps it was bad enough to make Homer turn over in his grave .
I 've studied and mulled over notebooks until I 'm incapable of forming an opinion of anything .
How thankful little Phil will be when all this examinating is over . ''
`` Examinating ?
I never heard such a word . ''
`` Well , have n't I as good a right to make a word as any one else ? ''
demanded Phil .
`` Words are n't made -- they grow , '' said Anne .
`` Never mind -- I begin faintly to discern clear water ahead where no examination breakers loom .
Girls , do you -- can you realize that our Redmond Life is almost over ? ''
`` I ca n't , '' said Anne , sorrowfully .
`` It seems just yesterday that Pris and I were alone in that crowd of Freshmen at Redmond .
And now we are Seniors in our final examinations . '' ''
` Potent , wise , and reverend Seniors , ' '' quoted Phil .
`` Do you suppose we really are any wiser than when we came to Redmond ? ''
`` You do n't act as if you were by times , '' said Aunt Jamesina severely .
`` Oh , Aunt Jimsie , have n't we been pretty good girls , take us by and large , these three winters you 've mothered us ? ''
pleaded Phil .
`` You 've been four of the dearest , sweetest , goodest girls that ever went together through college , '' averred Aunt Jamesina , who never spoiled a compliment by misplaced economy .
`` But I mistrust you have n't any too much sense yet .
It 's not to be expected , of course .
Experience teaches sense .
You ca n't learn it in a college course .
You 've been to college four years and I never was , but I know heaps more than you do , young ladies . '' ''
` There are lots of things that never go by rule , There 's a powerful pile o ' knowledge That you never get at college , There are heaps of things you never learn at school , ' '' quoted Stella .
`` Have you learned anything at Redmond except dead languages and geometry and such trash ? ''
queried Aunt Jamesina .
`` Oh , yes .
I think we have , Aunty , '' protested Anne .
`` We 've learned the truth of what Professor Woodleigh told us last Philomathic , '' said Phil .
`` He said , ` Humor is the spiciest condiment in the feast of existence .
Laugh at your mistakes but learn from them , joke over your troubles but gather strength from them , make a jest of your difficulties but overcome them . '
Is n't that worth learning , Aunt Jimsie ? ''
`` Yes , it is , dearie .
When you 've learned to laugh at the things that should be laughed at , and not to laugh at those that should n't , you 've got wisdom and understanding . ''
`` What have you got out of your Redmond course , Anne ? ''
murmured Priscilla aside .
`` I think , '' said Anne slowly , `` that I really have learned to look upon each little hindrance as a jest and each great one as the foreshadowing of victory .
Summing up , I think that is what Redmond has given me . ''
`` I shall have to fall back on another Professor Woodleigh quotation to express what it has done for me , '' said Priscilla .
`` You remember that he said in his address , ` There is so much in the world for us all if we only have the eyes to see it , and the heart to love it , and the hand to gather it to ourselves -- so much in men and women , so much in art and literature , so much everywhere in which to delight , and for which to be thankful . '
I think Redmond has taught me that in some measure , Anne . ''
`` Judging from what you all , say '' remarked Aunt Jamesina , `` the sum and substance is that you can learn -- if you 've got natural gumption enough -- in four years at college what it would take about twenty years of living to teach you .
Well , that justifies higher education in my opinion .
It 's a matter I was always dubious about before . ''
`` But what about people who have n't natural gumption , Aunt Jimsie ? ''
`` People who have n't natural gumption never learn , '' retorted Aunt Jamesina , `` neither in college nor life .
If they live to be a hundred they really do n't know anything more than when they were born .
It 's their misfortune not their fault , poor souls .
But those of us who have some gumption should duly thank the Lord for it . ''
`` Will you please define what gumption is , Aunt Jimsie ? ''
asked Phil .
`` No , I wo n't , young woman .
Any one who has gumption knows what it is , and any one who has n't can never know what it is .
So there is no need of defining it . ''
The busy days flew by and examinations were over .
Anne took High Honors in English .
Priscilla took Honors in Classics , and Phil in Mathematics .
Stella obtained a good all-round showing .
Then came Convocation .
`` This is what I would once have called an epoch in my life , '' said Anne , as she took Roy 's violets out of their box and gazed at them thoughtfully .
She meant to carry them , of course , but her eyes wandered to another box on her table .
It was filled with lilies-of-the-valley , as fresh and fragrant as those which bloomed in the Green Gables yard when June came to Avonlea .
Gilbert Blythe 's card lay beside it .
Anne wondered why Gilbert should have sent her flowers for Convocation .
She had seen very little of him during the past winter .
He had come to Patty 's Place only one Friday evening since the Christmas holidays , and they rarely met elsewhere .
She knew he was studying very hard , aiming at High Honors and the Cooper Prize , and he took little part in the social doings of Redmond .
Anne 's own winter had been quite gay socially .
She had seen a good deal of the Gardners ; she and Dorothy were very intimate ; college circles expected the announcement of her engagement to Roy any day .
Anne expected it herself .
Yet just before she left Patty 's Place for Convocation she flung Roy 's violets aside and put Gilbert 's lilies-of-the-valley in their place .
She could not have told why she did it .
Somehow , old Avonlea days and dreams and friendships seemed very close to her in this attainment of her long-cherished ambitions .
She and Gilbert had once picturedout merrily the day on which they should be capped and gowned graduates in Arts .
The wonderful day had come and Roy 's violets had no place in it .
Only her old friend 's flowers seemed to belong to this fruition of old-blossoming hopes which he had once shared .
For years this day had beckoned and allured to her ; but when it came the one single , keen , abiding memory it left with her was not that of the breathless moment when the stately president of Redmond gave her cap and diploma and hailed her B.A. ; it was not of the flash in Gilbert 's eyes when he saw her lilies , nor the puzzled pained glance Roy gave her as he passed her on the platform .
It was not of Aline Gardner 's condescending congratulations , or Dorothy 's ardent , impulsive good wishes .
It was of one strange , unaccountable pang that spoiled this long-expected day for her and left in it a certain faint but enduring flavor of bitterness .
The Arts graduates gave a graduation dance that night .
When Anne dressed for it she tossed aside the pearl beads she usually wore and took from her trunk the small box that had come to Green Gables on Christmas day .
In it was a thread-like gold chain with a tiny pink enamel heart as a pendant .
On the accompanying card was written , `` With all good wishes from your old chum , Gilbert . ''
Anne , laughing over the memory the enamel heart conjured up the fatal day when Gilbert had called her `` Carrots '' and vainly tried to make his peace with a pink candy heart , had written him a nice little note of thanks .
But she had never worn the trinket .
Tonight she fastened it about her white throat with a dreamy smile .
She and Phil walked to Redmond together .
Anne walked in silence ; Phil chattered of many things .
Suddenly she said , `` I heard today that Gilbert Blythe 's engagement to Christine Stuart was to be announced as soon as Convocation was over .
Did you hear anything of it ? ''
`` No , '' said Anne .
`` I think it 's true , '' said Phil lightly .
Anne did not speak .
In the darkness she felt her face burning .
She slipped her hand inside her collar and caught at the gold chain .
One energetic twist and it gave way .
Anne thrust the broken trinket into her pocket .
Her hands were trembling and her eyes were smarting .
But she was the gayest of all the gay revellers that night , and told Gilbert unregretfully that her card was full when he came to ask her for a dance .
Afterwards , when she sat with the girls before the dying embers at Patty 's Place , removing the spring chilliness from their satin skins , none chatted more blithely than she of the day 's events .
`` Moody Spurgeon MacPherson called here tonight after you left , '' said Aunt Jamesina , who had sat up to keep the fire on .
`` He did n't know about the graduation dance .
That boy ought to sleep with a rubber band around his head to train his ears not to stick out .
I had a beau once who did that and it improved him immensely .
It was I who suggested it to him and he took my advice , but he never forgave me for it . ''
`` Moody Spurgeon is a very serious young man , '' yawned Priscilla .
`` He is concerned with graver matters than his ears .
He is going to be a minister , you know . ''
`` Well , I suppose the Lord does n't regard the ears of a man , '' said Aunt Jamesina gravely , dropping all further criticism of Moody Spurgeon .
Aunt Jamesina had a proper respect for the cloth even in the case of an unfledged parson .
Chapter XXXVIII False Dawn `` Just imagine -- this night week I 'll be in Avonlea -- delightful thought ! ''
said Anne , bending over the box in which she was packing Mrs. Rachel Lynde 's quilts .
`` But just imagine -- this night week I 'll be gone forever from Patty 's Place -- horrible thought ! ''
`` I wonder if the ghost of all our laughter will echo through the maiden dreams of Miss Patty and Miss Maria , '' speculated Phil .
Miss Patty and Miss Maria were coming home , after having trotted over most of the habitable globe .
`` We 'll be back the second week in May '' wrote Miss Patty .
`` I expect Patty 's Place will seem rather small after the Hall of the Kings at Karnak , but I never did like big places to live in .
And I 'll be glad enough to be home again .
When you start traveling late in life you 're apt to do too much of it because you know you have n't much time left , and it 's a thing that grows on you .
I 'm afraid Maria will never be contented again . ''
`` I shall leave here my fancies and dreams to bless the next comer , '' said Anne , looking around the blue room wistfully -- her pretty blue room where she had spent three such happy years .
She had knelt at its window to pray and had bent from it to watch the sunset behind the pines .
She had heard the autumn raindrops beating against it and had welcomed the spring robins at its sill .
She wondered if old dreams could haunt rooms -- if , when one left forever the room where she had joyed and suffered and laughed and wept , something of her , intangible and invisible , yet nonetheless real , did not remain behind like a voiceful memory .
`` I think , '' said Phil , `` that a room where one dreams and grieves and rejoices and lives becomes inseparably connected with those processes and acquires a personality of its own .
I am sure if I came into this room fifty years from now it would say ` Anne , Anne ' to me .
What nice times we 've had here , honey !
What chats and jokes and good chummy jamborees !
Oh , dear me !
I 'm to marry Jo in June and I know I will be rapturously happy .
But just now I feel as if I wanted this lovely Redmond life to go on forever . ''
`` I 'm unreasonable enough just now to wish that , too , '' admitted Anne .
`` No matter what deeper joys may come to us later on we 'll never again have just the same delightful , irresponsible existence we 've had here .
It 's over forever , Phil . ''
`` What are you going to do with Rusty ? ''
asked Phil , as that privileged pussy padded into the room .
`` I am going to take him home with me and Joseph and the Sarah-cat , '' announced Aunt Jamesina , following Rusty .
`` It would be a shame to separate those cats now that they have learned to live together .
It 's a hard lesson for cats and humans to learn . ''
`` I 'm sorry to part with Rusty , '' said Anne regretfully , `` but it would be no use to take him to Green Gables .
Marilla detests cats , and Davy would tease his life out .
Besides , I do n't suppose I 'll be home very long .
I 've been offered the principalship of the Summerside High School . ''
`` Are you going to accept it ? ''
asked Phil .
`` I -- I have n't decided yet , '' answered Anne , with a confused flush .
Phil nodded understandingly .
Naturally Anne 's plans could not be settled until Roy had spoken .
He would soon -- there was no doubt of that .
And there was no doubt that Anne would say `` yes '' when he said `` Will you please ? ''
Anne herself regarded the state of affairs with a seldom-ruffled complacency .
She was deeply in love with Roy .
True , it was not just what she had imagined love to be .
But was anything in life , Anne asked herself wearily , like one 's imagination of it ?
It was the old diamond disillusion of childhood repeated -- the same disappointment she had felt when she had first seen the chill sparkle instead of the purple splendor she had anticipated .
`` That 's not my idea of a diamond , '' she had said .
But Roy was a dear fellow and they would be very happy together , even if some indefinable zest was missing out of life .
When Roy came down that evening and asked Anne to walk in the park every one at Patty 's Place knew what he had come to say ; and every one knew , or thought they knew , what Anne 's answer would be .
`` Anne is a very fortunate girl , '' said Aunt Jamesina .
`` I suppose so , '' said Stella , shrugging her shoulders .
`` Roy is a nice fellow and all that .
But there 's really nothing in him . ''
`` That sounds very like a jealous remark , Stella Maynard , '' said Aunt Jamesina rebukingly .
`` It does -- but I am not jealous , '' said Stella calmly .
`` I love Anne and I like Roy .
Everybody says she is making a brilliant match , and even Mrs. Gardner thinks her charming now .
It all sounds as if it were made in heaven , but I have my doubts .
Make the most of that , Aunt Jamesina . ''
Roy asked Anne to marry him in the little pavilion on the harbor shore where they had talked on the rainy day of their first meeting .
Anne thought it very romantic that he should have chosen that spot .
And his proposal was as beautifully worded as if he had copied it , as one of Ruby Gillis ' lovers had done , out of a Deportment of Courtship and Marriage .
The whole effect was quite flawless .
And it was also sincere .
There was no doubt that Roy meant what he said .
There was no false note to jar the symphony .
Anne felt that she ought to be thrilling from head to foot .
But she was n't ; she was horribly cool .
When Roy paused for his answer she opened her lips to say her fateful yes .
And then -- she found herself trembling as if she were reeling back from a precipice .
To her came one of those moments when we realize , as by a blinding flash of illumination , more than all our previous years have taught us .
She pulled her hand from Roy 's .
`` Oh , I ca n't marry you -- I ca n't -- I ca n't , '' she cried , wildly .
Roy turned pale -- and also looked rather foolish .
He had -- small blame to him -- felt very sure .
`` What do you mean ? ''
he stammered .
`` I mean that I ca n't marry you , '' repeated Anne desperately .
`` I thought I could -- but I ca n't . ''
`` Why ca n't you ? ''
Roy asked more calmly .
`` Because -- I do n't care enough for you . ''
A crimson streak came into Roy 's face .
`` So you 've just been amusing yourself these two years ? ''
he said slowly .
`` No , no , I have n't , '' gasped poor Anne .
Oh , how could she explain ?
She COULD N'T explain .
There are some things that can not be explained .
`` I did think I cared -- truly I did -- but I know now I do n't . ''
`` You have ruined my life , '' said Roy bitterly .
`` Forgive me , '' pleaded Anne miserably , with hot cheeks and stinging eyes .
Roy turned away and stood for a few minutes looking out seaward .
When he came back to Anne , he was very pale again .
`` You can give me no hope ? ''
he said .
Anne shook her head mutely .
`` Then -- good-bye , '' said Roy .
`` I ca n't understand it -- I ca n't believe you are not the woman I 've believed you to be .
But reproaches are idle between us .
You are the only woman I can ever love .
I thank you for your friendship , at least .
Good-bye , Anne . ''
`` Good-bye , '' faltered Anne .
When Roy had gone she sat for a long time in the pavilion , watching a white mist creeping subtly and remorselessly landward up the harbor .
It was her hour of humiliation and self-contempt and shame .
Their waves went over her .
And yet , underneath it all , was a queer sense of recovered freedom .
She slipped into Patty 's Place in the dusk and escaped to her room .
But Phil was there on the window seat .
`` Wait , '' said Anne , flushing to anticipate the scene .
`` Wait til you hear what I have to say .
Phil , Roy asked me to marry him-and I refused . ''
`` You -- you REFUSED him ? ''
said Phil blankly .
`` Yes . ''
`` Anne Shirley , are you in your senses ? ''
`` I think so , '' said Anne wearily .
`` Oh , Phil , do n't scold me .
You do n't understand . ''
`` I certainly do n't understand .
You 've encouraged Roy Gardner in every way for two years -- and now you tell me you 've refused him .
Then you 've just been flirting scandalously with him .
Anne , I could n't have believed it of YOU . ''
`` I WAS N'T flirting with him -- I honestly thought I cared up to the last minute -- and then -- well , I just knew I NEVER could marry him . ''
`` I suppose , '' said Phil cruelly , `` that you intended to marry him for his money , and then your better self rose up and prevented you . ''
`` I DID N'T .
I never thought about his money .
Oh , I ca n't explain it to you any more than I could to him . ''
`` Well , I certainly think you have treated Roy shamefully , '' said Phil in exasperation .
`` He 's handsome and clever and rich and good .
What more do you want ? ''
`` I want some one who BELONGS in my life .
He does n't .
I was swept off my feet at first by his good looks and knack of paying romantic compliments ; and later on I thought I MUST be in love because he was my dark-eyed ideal . ''
`` I am bad enough for not knowing my own mind , but you are worse , '' said Phil . ''
I DO know my own mind , '' protested Anne .
`` The trouble is , my mind changes and then I have to get acquainted with it all over again . ''
`` Well , I suppose there is no use in saying anything to you . ''
`` There is no need , Phil .
I 'm in the dust .
This has spoiled everything backwards .
I can never think of Redmond days without recalling the humiliation of this evening .
Roy despises me -- and you despise me -- and I despise myself . ''
`` You poor darling , '' said Phil , melting .
`` Just come here and let me comfort you .
I 've no right to scold you .
I 'd have married Alec or Alonzo if I had n't met Jo .
Oh , Anne , things are so mixed-up in real life .
They are n't clear-cut and trimmed off , as they are in novels . ''
`` I hope that NO one will ever again ask me to marry him as long as I live , '' sobbed poor Anne , devoutly believing that she meant it .
Chapter XXXIX Deals with Weddings Anne felt that life partook of the nature of an anticlimax during the first few weeks after her return to Green Gables .
She missed the merry comradeship of Patty 's Place .
She had dreamed some brilliant dreams during the past winter and now they lay in the dust around her .
In her present mood of self-disgust , she could not immediately begin dreaming again .
And she discovered that , while solitude with dreams is glorious , solitude without them has few charms .
She had not seen Roy again after their painful parting in the park pavilion ; but Dorothy came to see her before she left Kingsport .
`` I 'm awfully sorry you wo n't marry Roy , '' she said .
`` I did want you for a sister .
But you are quite right .
He would bore you to death .
I love him , and he is a dear sweet boy , but really he is n't a bit interesting .
He looks as if he ought to be , but he is n't . ''
`` This wo n't spoil OUR friendship , will it , Dorothy ? ''
Anne had asked wistfully .
`` No , indeed .
You 're too good to lose .
If I ca n't have you for a sister I mean to keep you as a chum anyway .
And do n't fret over Roy .
He is feeling terribly just now -- I have to listen to his outpourings every day -- but he 'll get over it .
He always does . ''
`` Oh -- ALWAYS ? ''
said Anne with a slight change of voice .
`` So he has ` got over it ' before ? ''
`` Dear me , yes , '' said Dorothy frankly .
`` Twice before .
And he raved to me just the same both times .
Not that the others actually refused him -- they simply announced their engagements to some one else .
Of course , when he met you he vowed to me that he had never really loved before -- that the previous affairs had been merely boyish fancies .
But I do n't think you need worry . ''
Anne decided not to worry .
Her feelings were a mixture of relief and resentment .
Roy had certainly told her she was the only one he had ever loved .
No doubt he believed it .
But it was a comfort to feel that she had not , in all likelihood , ruined his life .
There were other goddesses , and Roy , according to Dorothy , must needs be worshipping at some shrine .
Nevertheless , life was stripped of several more illusions , and Anne began to think drearily that it seemed rather bare .
She came down from the porch gable on the evening of her return with a sorrowful face .
`` What has happened to the old Snow Queen , Marilla ? ''
`` Oh , I knew you 'd feel bad over that , '' said Marilla .
`` I felt bad myself .
That tree was there ever since I was a young girl .
It blew down in the big gale we had in March .
It was rotten at the core . ''
`` I 'll miss it so , '' grieved Anne .
`` The porch gable does n't seem the same room without it .
I 'll never look from its window again without a sense of loss .
And oh , I never came home to Green Gables before that Diana was n't here to welcome me . ''
`` Diana has something else to think of just now , '' said Mrs. Lynde significantly .
`` Well , tell me all the Avonlea news , '' said Anne , sitting down on the porch steps , where the evening sunshine fell over her hair in a fine golden rain .
`` There is n't much news except what we 've wrote you , '' said Mrs. Lynde .
`` I suppose you have n't heard that Simon Fletcher broke his leg last week .
It 's a great thing for his family .
They 're getting a hundred things done that they 've always wanted to do but could n't as long as he was about , the old crank . ''
`` He came of an aggravating family , '' remarked Marilla .
`` Aggravating ?
Well , rather !
His mother used to get up in prayer-meeting and tell all her children 's shortcomings and ask prayers for them .
` Course it made them mad , and worse than ever . ''
`` You have n't told Anne the news about Jane , '' suggested Marilla .
`` Oh , Jane , '' sniffed Mrs. Lynde .
`` Well , '' she conceded grudgingly , `` Jane Andrews is home from the West -- came last week -- and she 's going to be married to a Winnipeg millionaire .
You may be sure Mrs. Harmon lost no time in telling it far and wide . ''
`` Dear old Jane -- I 'm so glad , '' said Anne heartily .
`` She deserves the good things of life . ''
`` Oh , I ai n't saying anything against Jane .
She 's a nice enough girl .
But she is n't in the millionaire class , and you 'll find there 's not much to recommend that man but his money , that 's what .
Mrs. Harmon says he 's an Englishman who has made money in mines but I believe he 'll turn out to be a Yankee .
He certainly must have money , for he has just showered Jane with jewelry .
Her engagement ring is a diamond cluster so big that it looks like a plaster on Jane 's fat paw . ''
Mrs. Lynde could not keep some bitterness out of her tone .
Here was Jane Andrews , that plain little plodder , engaged to a millionaire , while Anne , it seemed , was not yet bespoken by any one , rich or poor .
And Mrs. Harmon Andrews did brag insufferably .
`` What has Gilbert Blythe been doing to at college ? ''
asked Marilla .
`` I saw him when he came home last week , and he is so pale and thin I hardly knew him . ''
`` He studied very hard last winter , '' said Anne .
`` You know he took High Honors in Classics and the Cooper Prize .
It has n't been taken for five years !
So I think he 's rather run down .
We 're all a little tired . ''
`` Anyhow , you 're a B.A. and Jane Andrews is n't and never will be , '' said Mrs. Lynde , with gloomy satisfaction .
A few evenings later Anne went down to see Jane , but the latter was away in Charlottetown -- `` getting sewing done , '' Mrs. Harmon informed Anne proudly .
`` Of course an Avonlea dressmaker would n't do for Jane under the circumstances . ''
`` I 've heard something very nice about Jane , '' said Anne .
`` Yes , Jane has done pretty well , even if she is n't a B.A. , '' said Mrs. Harmon , with a slight toss of her head .
`` Mr. Inglis is worth millions , and they 're going to Europe on their wedding tour .
When they come back they 'll live in a perfect mansion of marble in Winnipeg .
Jane has only one trouble -- she can cook so well and her husband wo n't let her cook .
He is so rich he hires his cooking done .
They 're going to keep a cook and two other maids and a coachman and a man-of-all-work .
But what about YOU , Anne ?
I do n't hear anything of your being married , after all your college-going . ''
`` Oh , '' laughed Anne , `` I am going to be an old maid .
I really ca n't find any one to suit me . ''
It was rather wicked of her .
She deliberately meant to remind Mrs. Andrews that if she became an old maid it was not because she had not had at least one chance of marriage .
But Mrs. Harmon took swift revenge .
`` Well , the over-particular girls generally get left , I notice .
And what 's this I hear about Gilbert Blythe being engaged to a Miss Stuart ?
Charlie Sloane tells me she is perfectly beautiful .
Is it true ? ''
`` I do n't know if it is true that he is engaged to Miss Stuart , '' replied Anne , with Spartan composure , `` but it is certainly true that she is very lovely . ''
`` I once thought you and Gilbert would have made a match of it , '' said Mrs. Harmon .
`` If you do n't take care , Anne , all of your beaux will slip through your fingers . ''
Anne decided not to continue her duel with Mrs. Harmon .
You could not fence with an antagonist who met rapier thrust with blow of battle axe .
`` Since Jane is away , '' she said , rising haughtily , `` I do n't think I can stay longer this morning .
I 'll come down when she comes home . ''
`` Do , '' said Mrs. Harmon effusively .
`` Jane is n't a bit proud .
She just means to associate with her old friends the same as ever .
She 'll be real glad to see you . ''
Jane 's millionaire arrived the last of May and carried her off in a blaze of splendor .
Mrs. Lynde was spitefully gratified to find that Mr. Inglis was every day of forty , and short and thin and grayish .
Mrs. Lynde did not spare him in her enumeration of his shortcomings , you may be sure .
`` It will take all his gold to gild a pill like him , that 's what , '' said Mrs. Rachel solemnly .
`` He looks kind and good-hearted , '' said Anne loyally , `` and I 'm sure he thinks the world of Jane . ''
`` Humph ! ''
said Mrs. Rachel .
Phil Gordon was married the next week and Anne went over to Bolingbroke to be her bridesmaid .
Phil made a dainty fairy of a bride , and the Rev. Jo was so radiant in his happiness that nobody thought him plain .
`` We 're going for a lovers ' saunter through the land of Evangeline , '' said Phil , `` and then we 'll settle down on Patterson Street .
Mother thinks it is terrible -- she thinks Jo might at least take a church in a decent place .
But the wilderness of the Patterson slums will blossom like the rose for me if Jo is there .
Oh , Anne , I 'm so happy my heart aches with it . ''
Anne was always glad in the happiness of her friends ; but it is sometimes a little lonely to be surrounded everywhere by a happiness that is not your own .
And it was just the same when she went back to Avonlea .
This time it was Diana who was bathed in the wonderful glory that comes to a woman when her first-born is laid beside her .
Anne looked at the white young mother with a certain awe that had never entered into her feelings for Diana before .
Could this pale woman with the rapture in her eyes be the little black-curled , rosy-cheeked Diana she had played with in vanished schooldays ?
It gave her a queer desolate feeling that she herself somehow belonged only in those past years and had no business in the present at all .
`` Is n't he perfectly beautiful ? ''
said Diana proudly .
The little fat fellow was absurdly like Fred -- just as round , just as red .
Anne really could not say conscientiously that she thought him beautiful , but she vowed sincerely that he was sweet and kissable and altogether delightful .
`` Before he came I wanted a girl , so that I could call her ANNE , '' said Diana .
`` But now that little Fred is here I would n't exchange him for a million girls .
He just COULD N'T have been anything but his own precious self . '' ''
` Every little baby is the sweetest and the best , ' '' quoted Mrs. Allan gaily .
`` If little Anne HAD come you 'd have felt just the same about her . ''
Mrs. Allan was visiting in Avonlea , for the first time since leaving it .
She was as gay and sweet and sympathetic as ever .
Her old girl friends had welcomed her back rapturously .
The reigning minister 's wife was an estimable lady , but she was not exactly a kindred spirit .
`` I can hardly wait till he gets old enough to talk , '' sighed Diana .
`` I just long to hear him say ` mother . '
And oh , I 'm determined that his first memory of me shall be a nice one .
The first memory I have of my mother is of her slapping me for something I had done .
I am sure I deserved it , and mother was always a good mother and I love her dearly .
But I do wish my first memory of her was nicer . ''
`` I have just one memory of my mother and it is the sweetest of all my memories , '' said Mrs. Allan .
`` I was five years old , and I had been allowed to go to school one day with my two older sisters .
When school came out my sisters went home in different groups , each supposing I was with the other .
Instead I had run off with a little girl I had played with at recess .
We went to her home , which was near the school , and began making mud pies .
We were having a glorious time when my older sister arrived , breathless and angry . ''
` You naughty girl '' she cried , snatching my reluctant hand and dragging me along with her .
` Come home this minute .
Oh , you 're going to catch it !
Mother is awful cross .
She is going to give you a good whipping . '
`` I had never been whipped .
Dread and terror filled my poor little heart .
I have never been so miserable in my life as I was on that walk home .
I had not meant to be naughty .
Phemy Cameron had asked me to go home with her and I had not known it was wrong to go .
And now I was to be whipped for it .
When we got home my sister dragged me into the kitchen where mother was sitting by the fire in the twilight .
My poor wee legs were trembling so that I could hardly stand .
And mother -- mother just took me up in her arms , without one word of rebuke or harshness , kissed me and held me close to her heart . '
I was so frightened you were lost , darling , ' she said tenderly .
I could see the love shining in her eyes as she looked down on me .
She never scolded or reproached me for what I had done -- only told me I must never go away again without asking permission .
She died very soon afterwards .
That is the only memory I have of her .
Is n't it a beautiful one ? ''
Anne felt lonelier than ever as she walked home , going by way of the Birch Path and Willowmere .
She had not walked that way for many moons .
It was a darkly-purple bloomy night .
The air was heavy with blossom fragrance -- almost too heavy .
The cloyed senses recoiled from it as from an overfull cup .
The birches of the path had grown from the fairy saplings of old to big trees .
Everything had changed .
Anne felt that she would be glad when the summer was over and she was away at work again .
Perhaps life would not seem so empty then . ''
` I 've tried the world -- it wears no more The coloring of romance it wore , ' '' sighed Anne -- and was straightway much comforted by the romance in the idea of the world being denuded of romance !
Chapter XL A Book of Revelation The Irvings came back to Echo Lodge for the summer , and Anne spent a happy three weeks there in July .
Miss Lavendar had not changed ; Charlotta the Fourth was a very grown-up young lady now , but still adored Anne sincerely .
`` When all 's said and done , Miss Shirley , ma'am , I have n't seen any one in Boston that 's equal to you , '' she said frankly .
Paul was almost grown up , too .
He was sixteen , his chestnut curls had given place to close-cropped brown locks , and he was more interested in football than fairies .
But the bond between him and his old teacher still held .
Kindred spirits alone do not change with changing years .
It was a wet , bleak , cruel evening in July when Anne came back to Green Gables .
One of the fierce summer storms which sometimes sweep over the gulf was ravaging the sea .
As Anne came in the first raindrops dashed against the panes .
`` Was that Paul who brought you home ? ''
asked Marilla .
`` Why did n't you make him stay all night .
It 's going to be a wild evening . ''
`` He 'll reach Echo Lodge before the rain gets very heavy , I think .
Anyway , he wanted to go back tonight .
Well , I 've had a splendid visit , but I 'm glad to see you dear folks again .
` East , west , hame 's best . '
Davy , have you been growing again lately ? ''
`` I 've growed a whole inch since you left , '' said Davy proudly .
`` I 'm as tall as Milty Boulter now .
Ai n't I glad .
He 'll have to stop crowing about being bigger .
Say , Anne , did you know that Gilbert Blythe is dying ? ''
Anne stood quite silent and motionless , looking at Davy .
Her face had gone so white that Marilla thought she was going to faint .
`` Davy , hold your tongue , '' said Mrs. Rachel angrily .
`` Anne , do n't look like that -- DO N'T LOOK LIKE THAT !
We did n't mean to tell you so suddenly . ''
`` Is -- it -- true ? ''
asked Anne in a voice that was not hers .
`` Gilbert is very ill , '' said Mrs. Lynde gravely .
`` He took down with typhoid fever just after you left for Echo Lodge .
Did you never hear of it ? ''
`` No , '' said that unknown voice .
`` It was a very bad case from the start .
The doctor said he 'd been terribly run down .
They 've a trained nurse and everything 's been done .
DO N'T look like that , Anne .
While there 's life there 's hope . ''
`` Mr. Harrison was here this evening and he said they had no hope of him , '' reiterated Davy .
Marilla , looking old and worn and tired , got up and marched Davy grimly out of the kitchen .
`` Oh , DO N'T look so , dear , '' said Mrs. Rachel , putting her kind old arms about the pallid girl .
`` I have n't given up hope , indeed I have n't .
He 's got the Blythe constitution in his favor , that 's what . ''
Anne gently put Mrs. Lynde 's arms away from her , walked blindly across the kitchen , through the hall , up the stairs to her old room .
At its window she knelt down , staring out unseeingly .
It was very dark .
The rain was beating down over the shivering fields .
The Haunted Woods was full of the groans of mighty trees wrung in the tempest , and the air throbbed with the thunderous crash of billows on the distant shore .
And Gilbert was dying !
There is a book of Revelation in every one 's life , as there is in the Bible .
Anne read hers that bitter night , as she kept her agonized vigil through the hours of storm and darkness .
She loved Gilbert -- had always loved him !
She knew that now .
She knew that she could no more cast him out of her life without agony than she could have cut off her right hand and cast it from her .
And the knowledge had come too late -- too late even for the bitter solace of being with him at the last .
If she had not been so blind -- so foolish -- she would have had the right to go to him now .
But he would never know that she loved him -- he would go away from this life thinking that she did not care .
Oh , the black years of emptiness stretching before her !
She could not live through them -- she could not !
She cowered down by her window and wished , for the first time in her gay young life , that she could die , too .
If Gilbert went away from her , without one word or sign or message , she could not live .
Nothing was of any value without him .
She belonged to him and he to her .
In her hour of supreme agony she had no doubt of that .
He did not love Christine Stuart -- never had loved Christine Stuart .
Oh , what a fool she had been not to realize what the bond was that had held her to Gilbert -- to think that the flattered fancy she had felt for Roy Gardner had been love .
And now she must pay for her folly as for a crime .
Mrs. Lynde and Marilla crept to her door before they went to bed , shook their heads doubtfully at each other over the silence , and went away .
The storm raged all night , but when the dawn came it was spent .
Anne saw a fairy fringe of light on the skirts of darkness .
Soon the eastern hilltops had a fire-shot ruby rim .
The clouds rolled themselves away into great , soft , white masses on the horizon ; the sky gleamed blue and silvery .
A hush fell over the world .
Anne rose from her knees and crept downstairs .
The freshness of the rain-wind blew against her white face as she went out into the yard , and cooled her dry , burning eyes .
A merry rollicking whistle was lilting up the lane .
A moment later Pacifique Buote came in sight .
Anne 's physical strength suddenly failed her .
If she had not clutched at a low willow bough she would have fallen .
Pacifique was George Fletcher 's hired man , and George Fletcher lived next door to the Blythes .
Mrs. Fletcher was Gilbert 's aunt .
Pacifique would know if -- if -- Pacifique would know what there was to be known .
Pacifique strode sturdily on along the red lane , whistling .
He did not see Anne .
She made three futile attempts to call him .
He was almost past before she succeeded in making her quivering lips call , `` Pacifique ! ''
Pacifique turned with a grin and a cheerful good morning .
`` Pacifique , '' said Anne faintly , `` did you come from George Fletcher 's this morning ? ''
`` Sure , '' said Pacifique amiably .
`` I got de word las ' night dat my fader , he was seeck .
It was so stormy dat I could n't go den , so I start vair early dis mornin ' .
I 'm goin ' troo de woods for short cut . ''
`` Did you hear how Gilbert Blythe was this morning ? ''
Anne 's desperation drove her to the question .
Even the worst would be more endurable than this hideous suspense .
`` He 's better , '' said Pacifique .
`` He got de turn las ' night .
De doctor say he 'll be all right now dis soon while .
Had close shave , dough !
Dat boy , he jus ' keel himself at college .
Well , I mus ' hurry .
De old man , he 'll be in hurry to see me . ''
Pacifique resumed his walk and his whistle .
Anne gazed after him with eyes where joy was driving out the strained anguish of the night .
He was a very lank , very ragged , very homely youth .
But in her sight he was as beautiful as those who bring good tidings on the mountains .
Never , as long as she lived , would Anne see Pacifique 's brown , round , black-eyed face without a warm remembrance of the moment when he had given to her the oil of joy for mourning .
Long after Pacifique 's gay whistle had faded into the phantom of music and then into silence far up under the maples of Lover 's Lane Anne stood under the willows , tasting the poignant sweetness of life when some great dread has been removed from it .
The morning was a cup filled with mist and glamor .
In the corner near her was a rich surprise of new-blown , crystal-dewed roses .
The trills and trickles of song from the birds in the big tree above her seemed in perfect accord with her mood .
A sentence from a very old , very true , very wonderful Book came to her lips , `` Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning . ''
XLI Love Takes Up the Glass of Time `` I 've come up to ask you to go for one of our old-time rambles through September woods and ` over hills where spices grow , ' this afternoon , '' said Gilbert , coming suddenly around the porch corner .
`` Suppose we visit Hester Gray 's garden . ''
Anne , sitting on the stone step with her lap full of a pale , filmy , green stuff , looked up rather blankly .
`` Oh , I wish I could , '' she said slowly , `` but I really ca n't , Gilbert .
I 'm going to Alice Penhallow 's wedding this evening , you know .
I 've got to do something to this dress , and by the time it 's finished I 'll have to get ready .
I 'm so sorry .
I 'd love to go . ''
`` Well , can you go tomorrow afternoon , then ? ''
asked Gilbert , apparently not much disappointed .
`` Yes , I think so . ''
`` In that case I shall hie me home at once to do something I should otherwise have to do tomorrow .
So Alice Penhallow is to be married tonight .
Three weddings for you in one summer , Anne -- Phil 's , Alice 's , and Jane 's .
I 'll never forgive Jane for not inviting me to her wedding . ''
`` You really ca n't blame her when you think of the tremendous Andrews connection who had to be invited .
The house could hardly hold them all .
I was only bidden by grace of being Jane 's old chum -- at least on Jane 's part .
I think Mrs. Harmon 's motive for inviting me was to let me see Jane 's surpassing gorgeousness . ''
`` Is it true that she wore so many diamonds that you could n't tell where the diamonds left off and Jane began ? ''
Anne laughed .
`` She certainly wore a good many .
What with all the diamonds and white satin and tulle and lace and roses and orange blossoms , prim little Jane was almost lost to sight .
But she was VERY happy , and so was Mr. Inglis -- and so was Mrs. Harmon . ''
`` Is that the dress you 're going to wear tonight ? ''
asked Gilbert , looking down at the fluffs and frills .
`` Yes .
Is n't it pretty ?
And I shall wear starflowers in my hair .
The Haunted Wood is full of them this summer . ''
Gilbert had a sudden vision of Anne , arrayed in a frilly green gown , with the virginal curves of arms and throat slipping out of it , and white stars shining against the coils of her ruddy hair .
The vision made him catch his breath .
But he turned lightly away .
`` Well , I 'll be up tomorrow .
Hope you 'll have a nice time tonight . ''
Anne looked after him as he strode away , and sighed .
Gilbert was friendly -- very friendly -- far too friendly .
He had come quite often to Green Gables after his recovery , and something of their old comradeship had returned .
But Anne no longer found it satisfying .
The rose of love made the blossom of friendship pale and scentless by contrast .
And Anne had again begun to doubt if Gilbert now felt anything for her but friendship .
In the common light of common day her radiant certainty of that rapt morning had faded .
She was haunted by a miserable fear that her mistake could never be rectified .
It was quite likely that it was Christine whom Gilbert loved after all .
Perhaps he was even engaged to her .
Anne tried to put all unsettling hopes out of her heart , and reconcile herself to a future where work and ambition must take the place of love .
She could do good , if not noble , work as a teacher ; and the success her little sketches were beginning to meet with in certain editorial sanctums augured well for her budding literary dreams .
But -- but -- Anne picked up her green dress and sighed again .
When Gilbert came the next afternoon he found Anne waiting for him , fresh as the dawn and fair as a star , after all the gaiety of the preceding night .
She wore a green dress -- not the one she had worn to the wedding , but an old one which Gilbert had told her at a Redmond reception he liked especially .
It was just the shade of green that brought out the rich tints of her hair , and the starry gray of her eyes and the iris-like delicacy of her skin .
Gilbert , glancing at her sideways as they walked along a shadowy woodpath , thought she had never looked so lovely .
Anne , glancing sideways at Gilbert , now and then , thought how much older he looked since his illness .
It was as if he had put boyhood behind him forever .
The day was beautiful and the way was beautiful .
Anne was almost sorry when they reached Hester Gray 's garden , and sat down on the old bench .
But it was beautiful there , too -- as beautiful as it had been on the faraway day of the Golden Picnic , when Diana and Jane and Priscilla and she had found it .
Then it had been lovely with narcissus and violets ; now golden rod had kindled its fairy torches in the corners and asters dotted it bluely .
The call of the brook came up through the woods from the valley of birches with all its old allurement ; the mellow air was full of the purr of the sea ; beyond were fields rimmed by fences bleached silvery gray in the suns of many summers , and long hills scarfed with the shadows of autumnal clouds ; with the blowing of the west wind old dreams returned .
`` I think , '' said Anne softly , `` that ` the land where dreams come true ' is in the blue haze yonder , over that little valley . ''
`` Have you any unfulfilled dreams , Anne ? ''
asked Gilbert .
Something in his tone -- something she had not heard since that miserable evening in the orchard at Patty 's Place -- made Anne 's heart beat wildly .
But she made answer lightly .
`` Of course .
Everybody has .
It would n't do for us to have all our dreams fulfilled .
We would be as good as dead if we had nothing left to dream about .
What a delicious aroma that low-descending sun is extracting from the asters and ferns .
I wish we could see perfumes as well as smell them .
I 'm sure they would be very beautiful . ''
Gilbert was not to be thus sidetracked .
`` I have a dream , '' he said slowly .
`` I persist in dreaming it , although it has often seemed to me that it could never come true .
I dream of a home with a hearth-fire in it , a cat and dog , the footsteps of friends -- and YOU ! ''
Anne wanted to speak but she could find no words .
Happiness was breaking over her like a wave .
It almost frightened her .
`` I asked you a question over two years ago , Anne .
If I ask it again today will you give me a different answer ? ''
Still Anne could not speak .
But she lifted her eyes , shining with all the love-rapture of countless generations , and looked into his for a moment .
He wanted no other answer .
They lingered in the old garden until twilight , sweet as dusk in Eden must have been , crept over it .
There was so much to talk over and recall -- things said and done and heard and thought and felt and misunderstood .
`` I thought you loved Christine Stuart , '' Anne told him , as reproachfully as if she had not given him every reason to suppose that she loved Roy Gardner .
Gilbert laughed boyishly .
`` Christine was engaged to somebody in her home town .
I knew it and she knew I knew it .
When her brother graduated he told me his sister was coming to Kingsport the next winter to take music , and asked me if I would look after her a bit , as she knew no one and would be very lonely .
So I did .
And then I liked Christine for her own sake .
She is one of the nicest girls I 've ever known .
I knew college gossip credited us with being in love with each other .
I did n't care .
Nothing mattered much to me for a time there , after you told me you could never love me , Anne .
There was nobody else -- there never could be anybody else for me but you .
I 've loved you ever since that day you broke your slate over my head in school . ''
`` I do n't see how you could keep on loving me when I was such a little fool , '' said Anne .
`` Well , I tried to stop , '' said Gilbert frankly , `` not because I thought you what you call yourself , but because I felt sure there was no chance for me after Gardner came on the scene .
But I could n't -- and I ca n't tell you , either , what it 's meant to me these two years to believe you were going to marry him , and be told every week by some busybody that your engagement was on the point of being announced .
I believed it until one blessed day when I was sitting up after the fever .
I got a letter from Phil Gordon -- Phil Blake , rather -- in which she told me there was really nothing between you and Roy , and advised me to ` try again . '
Well , the doctor was amazed at my rapid recovery after that . ''
Anne laughed -- then shivered .
`` I can never forget the night I thought you were dying , Gilbert .
Oh , I knew -- I KNEW then -- and I thought it was too late . ''
`` But it was n't , sweetheart .
Oh , Anne , this makes up for everything , does n't it ?
Let 's resolve to keep this day sacred to perfect beauty all our lives for the gift it has given us . ''
`` It 's the birthday of our happiness , '' said Anne softly .
`` I 've always loved this old garden of Hester Gray 's , and now it will be dearer than ever . ''
`` But I 'll have to ask you to wait a long time , Anne , '' said Gilbert sadly .
`` It will be three years before I 'll finish my medical course .
And even then there will be no diamond sunbursts and marble halls . ''
Anne laughed .
`` I do n't want sunbursts and marble halls .
I just want YOU .
You see I 'm quite as shameless as Phil about it .
Sunbursts and marble halls may be all very well , but there is more ` scope for imagination ' without them .
And as for the waiting , that does n't matter .
We 'll just be happy , waiting and working for each other -- and dreaming .
Oh , dreams will be very sweet now . ''
Gilbert drew her close to him and kissed her .

I .
The Hurrying of Ludovic Anne Shirley was curled up on the window-seat of Theodora Dix 's sitting-room one Saturday evening , looking dreamily afar at some fair starland beyond the hills of sunset .
Anne was visiting for a fortnight of her vacation at Echo Lodge , where Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Irving were spending the summer , and she often ran over to the old Dix homestead to chat for awhile with Theodora .
They had had their chat out , on this particular evening , and Anne was giving herself over to the delight of building an air-castle .
She leaned her shapely head , with its braided coronet of dark red hair , against the window-casing , and her gray eyes were like the moonlight gleam of shadowy pools .
Then she saw Ludovic Speed coming down the lane .
He was yet far from the house , for the Dix lane was a long one , but Ludovic could be recognized as far as he could be seen .
No one else in Middle Grafton had such a tall , gently-stooping , placidly-moving figure .
In every kink and turn of it there was an individuality all Ludovic 's own .
Anne roused herself from her dreams , thinking it would only be tactful to take her departure .
Ludovic was courting Theodora .
Everyone in Grafton knew that , or , if anyone were in ignorance of the fact , it was not because he had not had time to find out .
Ludovic had been coming down that lane to see Theodora , in the same ruminating , unhastening fashion , for fifteen years !
When Anne , who was slim and girlish and romantic , rose to go , Theodora , who was plump and middle-aged and practical , said , with a twinkle in her eye : `` There is n't any hurry , child .
Sit down and have your call out .
You 've seen Ludovic coming down the lane , and , I suppose , you think you 'll be a crowd .
But you wo n't .
Ludovic rather likes a third person around , and so do I .
It spurs up the conversation as it were .
When a man has been coming to see you straight along , twice a week for fifteen years , you get rather talked out by spells . ''
Theodora never pretended to bashfulness where Ludovic was concerned .
She was not at all shy of referring to him and his dilatory courtship .
Indeed , it seemed to amuse her .
Anne sat down again and together they watched Ludovic coming down the lane , gazing calmly about him at the lush clover fields and the blue loops of the river winding in and out of the misty valley below .
Anne looked at Theodora 's placid , finely-moulded face and tried to imagine what she herself would feel like if she were sitting there , waiting for an elderly lover who had , seemingly , taken so long to make up his mind .
But even Anne 's imagination failed her for this .
`` Anyway , '' she thought , impatiently , `` if I wanted him I think I 'd find some way of hurrying him up .
Ludovic SPEED !
Was there ever such a misfit of a name ?
Such a name for such a man is a delusion and a snare . ''
Presently Ludovic got to the house , but stood so long on the doorstep in a brown study , gazing into the tangled green boskage of the cherry orchard , that Theodora finally went and opened the door before he knocked .
As she brought him into the sitting-room she made a comical grimace at Anne over his shoulder .
Ludovic smiled pleasantly at Anne .
He liked her ; she was the only young girl he knew , for he generally avoided young girls -- they made him feel awkward and out of place .
But Anne did not affect him in this fashion .
She had a way of getting on with all sorts of people , and , although they had not known her very long , both Ludovic and Theodora looked upon her as an old friend .
Ludovic was tall and somewhat ungainly , but his unhesitating placidity gave him the appearance of a dignity that did not otherwise pertain to him .
He had a drooping , silky , brown moustache , and a little curly tuft of imperial , -- a fashion which was regarded as eccentric in Grafton , where men had clean-shaven chins or went full-bearded .
His eyes were dreamy and pleasant , with a touch of melancholy in their blue depths .
He sat down in the big bulgy old armchair that had belonged to Theodora 's father .
Ludovic always sat there , and Anne declared that the chair had come to look like him .
The conversation soon grew animated enough .
Ludovic was a good talker when he had somebody to draw him out .
He was well read , and frequently surprised Anne by his shrewd comments on men and matters out in the world , of which only the faint echoes reached Deland River .
He had also a liking for religious arguments with Theodora , who did not care much for politics or the making of history , but was avid of doctrines , and read everything pertaining thereto .
When the conversation drifted into an eddy of friendly wrangling between Ludovic and Theodora over Christian Science , Anne understood that her usefulness was ended for the time being , and that she would not be missed .
`` It 's star time and good-night time , '' she said , and went away quietly .
But she had to stop to laugh when she was well out of sight of the house , in a green meadow bestarred with the white and gold of daisies .
A wind , odour-freighted , blew daintily across it .
Anne leaned against a white birch tree in the corner and laughed heartily , as she was apt to do whenever she thought of Ludovic and Theodora .
To her eager youth , this courtship of theirs seemed a very amusing thing .
She liked Ludovic , but allowed herself to be provoked with him .
`` The dear , big , irritating goose ! ''
she said aloud .
`` There never was such a lovable idiot before .
He 's just like the alligator in the old rhyme , who would n't go along , and would n't keep still , but just kept bobbing up and down . ''
Two evenings later , when Anne went over to the Dix place , she and Theodora drifted into a conversation about Ludovic .
Theodora , who was the most industrious soul alive , and had a mania for fancy work into the bargain , was busying her smooth , plump fingers with a very elaborate Battenburg lace centre-piece .
Anne was lying back in a little rocker , with her slim hands folded in her lap , watching Theodora .
She realized that Theodora was very handsome , in a stately , Juno-like fashion of firm , white flesh , large , clearly-chiselled outlines , and great , cowey , brown eyes .
When Theodora was not smiling , she looked very imposing .
Anne thought it likely that Ludovic held her in awe .
`` Did you and Ludovic talk about Christian Science ALL Saturday evening ? ''
she asked .
Theodora overflowed into a smile .
`` Yes , and we even quarrelled over it .
At least I did .
Ludovic would n't quarrel with anyone .
You have to fight air when you spar with him .
I hate to square up to a person who wo n't hit back . ''
`` Theodora , '' said Anne coaxingly , `` I am going to be curious and impertinent .
You can snub me if you like .
Why do n't you and Ludovic get married ? ''
Theodora laughed comfortably .
`` That 's the question Grafton folks have been asking for quite a while , I reckon , Anne .
Well , I 'd have no objection to marrying Ludovic .
That 's frank enough for you , is n't it ?
But it 's not easy to marry a man unless he asks you .
And Ludovic has never asked me . ''
`` Is he too shy ? ''
persisted Anne .
Since Theodora was in the mood , she meant to sift this puzzling affair to the bottom .
Theodora dropped her work and looked meditatively out over the green slopes of the summer world .
`` No , I do n't think it is that .
Ludovic is n't shy .
It 's just his way -- the Speed way .
The Speeds are all dreadfully deliberate .
They spend years thinking over a thing before they make up their minds to do it .
Sometimes they get so much in the habit of thinking about it that they never get over it -- like old Alder Speed , who was always talking of going to England to see his brother , but never went , though there was no earthly reason why he should n't .
They 're not lazy , you know , but they love to take their time . ''
`` And Ludovic is just an aggravated case of Speedism , '' suggested Anne .
`` Exactly .
He never hurried in his life .
Why , he has been thinking for the last six years of getting his house painted .
He talks it over with me every little while , and picks out the colour , and there the matter stays .
He 's fond of me , and he means to ask me to have him sometime .
The only question is -- will the time ever come ? ''
`` Why do n't you hurry him up ? ''
asked Anne impatiently .
Theodora went back to her stitches with another laugh .
`` If Ludovic could be hurried up , I 'm not the one to do it .
I 'm too shy .
It sounds ridiculous to hear a woman of my age and inches say that , but it is true .
Of course , I know it 's the only way any Speed ever did make out to get married .
For instance , there 's a cousin of mine married to Ludovic 's brother .
I do n't say she proposed to him out and out , but , mind you , Anne , it was n't far from it .
I could n't do anything like that .
I DID try once .
When I realized that I was getting sere and mellow , and all the girls of my generation were going off on either hand , I tried to give Ludovic a hint .
But it stuck in my throat .
And now I do n't mind .
If I do n't change Dix to Speed until I take the initiative , it will be Dix to the end of life .
Ludovic does n't realize that we are growing old , you know .
He thinks we are giddy young folks yet , with plenty of time before us .
That 's the Speed failing .
They never find out they 're alive until they 're dead . ''
`` You 're fond of Ludovic , are n't you ? ''
asked Anne , detecting a note of real bitterness among Theodora 's paradoxes .
`` Laws , yes , '' said Theodora candidly .
She did not think it worth while to blush over so settled a fact .
`` I think the world and all of Ludovic .
And he certainly does need somebody to look after HIM .
He 's neglected -- he looks frayed .
You can see that for yourself .
That old aunt of his looks after his house in some fashion , but she does n't look after him .
And he 's coming now to the age when a man needs to be looked after and coddled a bit .
I 'm lonesome here , and Ludovic is lonesome up there , and it does seem ridiculous , does n't it ?
I do n't wonder that we 're the standing joke of Grafton .
Goodness knows , I laugh at it enough myself .
I 've sometimes thought that if Ludovic could be made jealous it might spur him along .
But I never could flirt and there 's nobody to flirt with if I could .
Everybody hereabouts looks upon me as Ludovic 's property and nobody would dream of interfering with him . ''
`` Theodora , '' cried Anne , `` I have a plan ! ''
`` Now , what are you going to do ? ''
exclaimed Theodora .
Anne told her .
At first Theodora laughed and protested .
In the end , she yielded somewhat doubtfully , overborne by Anne 's enthusiasm .
`` Well , try it , then , '' she said , resignedly .
`` If Ludovic gets mad and leaves me , I 'll be worse off than ever .
But nothing venture , nothing win .
And there is a fighting chance , I suppose .
Besides , I must admit I 'm tired of his dilly-dallying . ''
Anne went back to Echo Lodge tingling with delight in her plot .
She hunted up Arnold Sherman , and told him what was required of him .
Arnold Sherman listened and laughed .
He was an elderly widower , an intimate friend of Stephen Irving , and had come down to spend part of the summer with him and his wife in Prince Edward Island .
He was handsome in a mature style , and he had a dash of mischief in him still , so that he entered readily enough into Anne 's plan .
It amused him to think of hurrying Ludovic Speed , and he knew that Theodora Dix could be depended on to do her part .
The comedy would not be dull , whatever its outcome .
The curtain rose on the first act after prayer meeting on the next Thursday night .
It was bright moonlight when the people came out of church , and everybody saw it plainly .
Arnold Sherman stood upon the steps close to the door , and Ludovic Speed leaned up against a corner of the graveyard fence , as he had done for years .
The boys said he had worn the paint off that particular place .
Ludovic knew of no reason why he should paste himself up against the church door .
Theodora would come out as usual , and he would join her as she went past the corner .
This was what happened , Theodora came down the steps , her stately figure outlined in its darkness against the gush of lamplight from the porch .
Arnold Sherman asked her if he might see her home .
Theodora took his arm calmly , and together they swept past the stupefied Ludovic , who stood helplessly gazing after them as if unable to believe his eyes .
For a few moments he stood there limply ; then he started down the road after his fickle lady and her new admirer .
The boys and irresponsible young men crowded after , expecting some excitement , but they were disappointed .
Ludovic strode on until he overtook Theodora and Arnold Sherman , and then fell meekly in behind them .
Theodora hardly enjoyed her walk home , although Arnold Sherman laid himself out to be especially entertaining .
Her heart yearned after Ludovic , whose shuffling footsteps she heard behind her .
She feared that she had been very cruel , but she was in for it now .
She steeled herself by the reflection that it was all for his own good , and she talked to Arnold Sherman as if he were the one man in the world .
Poor , deserted Ludovic , following humbly behind , heard her , and if Theodora had known how bitter the cup she was holding to his lips really was , she would never have been resolute enough to present it , no matter for what ultimate good .
When she and Arnold turned in at her gate , Ludovic had to stop .
Theodora looked over her shoulder and saw him standing still on the road .
His forlorn figure haunted her thoughts all night .
If Anne had not run over the next day and bolstered up her convictions , she might have spoiled everything by prematurely relenting .
Ludovic , meanwhile , stood still on the road , quite oblivious to the hoots and comments of the vastly amused small boy contingent , until Theodora and his rival disappeared from his view under the firs in the hollow of her lane .
Then he turned about and went home , not with his usual leisurely amble , but with a perturbed stride which proclaimed his inward disquiet .
He felt bewildered .
If the world had come suddenly to an end or if the lazy , meandering Grafton River had turned about and flowed up hill , Ludovic could not have been more astonished .
For fifteen years he had walked home from meetings with Theodora ; and now this elderly stranger , with all the glamour of `` the States '' hanging about him , had coolly walked off with her under Ludovic 's very nose .
Worse -- most unkindest cut of all -- Theodora had gone with him willingly ; nay , she had evidently enjoyed his company .
Ludovic felt the stirring of a righteous anger in his easy-going soul .
When he reached the end of his lane , he paused at his gate , and looked at his house , set back from the lane in a crescent of birches .
Even in the moonlight , its weather-worn aspect was plainly visible .
He thought of the `` palatial residence '' rumour ascribed to Arnold Sherman in Boston , and stroked his chin nervously with his sunburnt fingers .
Then he doubled up his fist and struck it smartly on the gate-post .
`` Theodora need n't think she is going to jilt me in this fashion , after keeping company with me for fifteen years , '' he said .
`` I 'LL have something to say to it , Arnold Sherman or no Arnold Sherman .
The impudence of the puppy ! ''
The next morning Ludovic drove to Carmody and engaged Joshua Pye to come and paint his house , and that evening , although he was not due till Saturday night , he went down to see Theodora .
Arnold Sherman was there before him , and was actually sitting in Ludovic 's own prescriptive chair .
Ludovic had to deposit himself in Theodora 's new wicker rocker , where he looked and felt lamentably out of place .
If Theodora felt the situation to be awkward , she carried it off superbly .
She had never looked handsomer , and Ludovic perceived that she wore her second best silk dress .
He wondered miserably if she had donned it in expectation of his rival 's call .
She had never put on silk dresses for him .
Ludovic had always been the meekest and mildest of mortals , but he felt quite murderous as he sat mutely there and listened to Arnold Sherman 's polished conversation .
`` You should just have been here to see him glowering , '' Theodora told the delighted Anne the next day .
`` It may be wicked of me , but I felt real glad .
I was afraid he might stay away and sulk .
So long as he comes here and sulks I do n't worry .
But he is feeling badly enough , poor soul , and I 'm really eaten up by remorse .
He tried to outstay Mr. Sherman last night , but he did n't manage it .
You never saw a more depressed-looking creature than he was as he hurried down the lane .
Yes , he actually hurried . ''
The following Sunday evening Arnold Sherman walked to church with Theodora , and sat with her .
When they came in Ludovic Speed suddenly stood up in his pew under the gallery .
He sat down again at once , but everybody in view had seen him , and that night folks in all the length and breadth of Grafton River discussed the dramatic occurrence with keen enjoyment .
`` Yes , he jumped right up as if he was pulled on his feet , while the minister was reading the chapter , '' said his cousin , Lorella Speed , who had been in church , to her sister , who had not .
`` His face was as white as a sheet , and his eyes were just glaring out of his head .
I never felt so thrilled , I declare !
I almost expected him to fly at them then and there .
But he just gave a sort of gasp and set down again .
I do n't know whether Theodora Dix saw him or not .
She looked as cool and unconcerned as you please . ''
Theodora had not seen Ludovic , but if she looked cool and unconcerned , her appearance belied her , for she felt miserably flustered .
She could not prevent Arnold Sherman coming to church with her , but it seemed to her like going too far .
People did not go to church and sit together in Grafton unless they were the next thing to being engaged .
What if this filled Ludovic with the narcotic of despair instead of wakening him up !
She sat through the service in misery and heard not one word of the sermon .
But Ludovic 's spectacular performances were not yet over .
The Speeds might be hard to get started , but once they were started their momentum was irresistible .
When Theodora and Mr. Sherman came out , Ludovic was waiting on the steps .
He stood up straight and stern , with his head thrown back and his shoulders squared .
There was open defiance in the look he cast on his rival , and masterfulness in the mere touch of the hand he laid on Theodora 's arm .
`` May I see you home , Miss Dix ? ''
his words said .
His tone said , `` I am going to see you home whether or no . ''
Theodora , with a deprecating look at Arnold Sherman , took his arm , and Ludovic marched her across the green amid a silence which the very horses tied to the storm fence seemed to share .
For Ludovic 't was a crowded hour of glorious life .
Anne walked all the way over from Avonlea the next day to hear the news .
Theodora smiled consciously .
`` Yes , it is really settled at last , Anne .
Coming home last night Ludovic asked me plump and plain to marry him , -- Sunday and all as it was .
It 's to be right away -- for Ludovic wo n't be put off a week longer than necessary . ''
`` So Ludovic Speed has been hurried up to some purpose at last , '' said Mr. Sherman , when Anne called in at Echo Lodge , brimful with her news .
`` And you are delighted , of course , and my poor pride must be the scapegoat .
I shall always be remembered in Grafton as the man from Boston who wanted Theodora Dix and could n't get her . ''
`` But that wo n't be true , you know , '' said Anne comfortingly .
Arnold Sherman thought of Theodora 's ripe beauty , and the mellow companionableness she had revealed in their brief intercourse .
`` I 'm not perfectly sure of that , '' he said , with a half sigh .
II .
Old Lady Lloyd I .
The May Chapter Spencervale gossip always said that `` Old Lady Lloyd '' was rich and mean and proud .
Gossip , as usual , was one-third right and two-thirds wrong .
Old Lady Lloyd was neither rich nor mean ; in reality she was pitifully poor -- so poor that `` Crooked Jack '' Spencer , who dug her garden and chopped her wood for her , was opulent by contrast , for he , at least , never lacked three meals a day , and the Old Lady could sometimes achieve no more than one .
But she WAS very proud -- so proud that she would have died rather than let the Spencervale people , among whom she had queened it in her youth , suspect how poor she was and to what straits was sometimes reduced .
She much preferred to have them think her miserly and odd -- a queer old recluse who never went anywhere , even to church , and who paid the smallest subscription to the minister 's salary of anyone in the congregation .
`` And her just rolling in wealth ! ''
they said indignantly .
`` Well , she did n't get her miserly ways from her parents .
THEY were real generous and neighbourly .
There never was a finer gentleman than old Doctor Lloyd .
He was always doing kindnesses to everybody ; and he had a way of doing them that made you feel as if you was doing the favour , not him .
Well , well , let Old Lady Lloyd keep herself and her money to herself if she wants to .
If she does n't want our company , she does n't have to suffer it , that 's all .
Reckon she is n't none too happy for all her money and pride . ''
No , the Old Lady was none too happy , that was unfortunately true .
It is not easy to be happy when your life is eaten up with loneliness and emptiness on the spiritual side , and when , on the material side , all you have between you and starvation is the little money your hens bring you in .
The Old Lady lived `` away back at the old Lloyd place , '' as it was always called .
It was a quaint , low-eaved house , with big chimneys and square windows and with spruces growing thickly all around it .
The Old Lady lived there all alone and there were weeks at a time when she never saw a human being except Crooked Jack .
What the Old Lady did with herself and how she put in her time was a puzzle the Spencervale people could not solve .
The children believed she amused herself counting the gold in the big black box under her bed .
Spencervale children held the Old Lady in mortal terror ; some of them -- the `` Spencer Road '' fry -- believed she was a witch ; all of them would run if , when wandering about the woods in search of berries or spruce gum , they saw at a distance the spare , upright form of the Old Lady , gathering sticks for her fire .
Mary Moore was the only one who was quite sure she was not a witch .
`` Witches are always ugly , '' she said decisively , `` and Old Lady Lloyd is n't ugly .
She 's real pretty -- she 's got such a soft white hair and big black eyes and a little white face .
Those Road children do n't know what they 're talking of .
Mother says they 're a very ignorant crowd . ''
`` Well , she does n't ever go to church , and she mutters and talks to herself all the time she 's picking up sticks , '' maintained Jimmy Kimball stoutly .
The Old Lady talked to herself because she was really very fond of company and conversation .
To be sure , when you have talked to nobody but yourself for nearly twenty years , it is apt to grow somewhat monotonous ; and there were times when the Old Lady would have sacrificed everything but her pride for a little human companionship .
At such times she felt very bitter and resentful toward Fate for having taken everything from her .
She had nothing to love , and that is about as unwholesome a condition as is possible to anyone .
It was always hardest in the spring .
Once upon a time the Old Lady -- when she had not been the Old Lady , but pretty , wilful , high-spirited Margaret Lloyd -- had loved springs ; now she hated them because they hurt her ; and this particular spring of this particular May chapter hurt her more than any that had gone before .
The Old Lady felt as if she could NOT endure the ache of it .
Everything hurt her -- the new green tips on the firs , the fairy mists down in the little beech hollow below the house , the fresh smell of the red earth Crooked Jack spaded up in her garden .
The Old Lady lay awake all one moonlit night and cried for very heartache .
She even forgot her body hunger in her soul hunger ; and the Old Lady had been hungry , more or less , all that week .
She was living on store biscuits and water , so that she might be able to pay Crooked Jack for digging her garden .
When the pale , lovely dawn-colour came stealing up the sky behind the spruces , the Old Lady buried her face in her pillow and refused to look at it .
`` I hate the new day , '' she said rebelliously .
`` It will be just like all the other hard , common days .
I do n't want to get up and live it .
And , oh , to think that long ago I reached out my hands joyfully to every new day , as to a friend who was bringing me good tidings !
I loved the mornings then -- sunny or gray , they were as delightful as an unread book -- and now I hate them -- hate them -- hate them ! ''
But the Old Lady got up nevertheless , for she knew Crooked Jack would be coming early to finish the garden .
She arranged her beautiful , thick , white hair very carefully , and put on her purple silk dress with the little gold spots in it .
The Old Lady always wore silk from motives of economy .
It was much cheaper to wear a silk dress that had belonged to her mother than to buy new print at the store .
The Old Lady had plenty of silk dresses which had belonged to her mother .
She wore them morning , noon , and night , and Spencervale people considered it an additional evidence of her pride .
As for the fashion of them , it was , of course , just because she was too mean to have them made over .
They did not dream that the Old Lady never put on one of the silk dresses without agonizing over its unfashionableness , and that even the eyes of Crooked Jack cast on her antique flounces and overskirts was almost more than her feminine vanity could endure .
In spite of the fact that the Old Lady had not welcomed the new day , its beauty charmed her when she went out for a walk after her dinner -- or , rather , after her mid-day biscuit .
It was so fresh , so sweet , so virgin ; and the spruce woods around the old Lloyd place were athrill with busy spring doings and all sprinkled through with young lights and shadows .
Some of their delight found its way into the Old Lady 's bitter heart as she wandered through them , and when she came out at the little plank bridge over the brook down under the beeches , she felt almost gentle and tender once more .
There was one big beech there , in particular , which the Old Lady loved for reasons best known to herself -- a great , tall beech with a trunk like the shaft of a gray marble column and a leafy spread of branches over the still , golden-brown pool made beneath it by the brook .
It had been a young sapling in the days that were haloed by the vanished glory of the Old Lady 's life .
The Old Lady heard childish voices and laughter afar up the lane which led to William Spencer 's place just above the woods .
William Spencer 's front lane ran out to the main road in a different direction , but this `` back lane '' furnished a short cut and his children always went to school that way .
The Old Lady shrank hastily back behind a clump of young spruces .
She did not like the Spencer children because they always seemed so afraid of her .
Through the spruce screen she could see them coming gaily down the lane -- the two older ones in front , the twins behind , clinging to the hands of a tall , slim , young girl -- the new music teacher , probably .
The Old Lady had heard from the egg pedlar that she was going to board at William Spencer 's , but she had not heard her name .
She looked at her with some curiosity as they drew near -- and then , all at once , the Old Lady 's heart gave a great bound and began to beat as it had not beaten for years , while her breath came quickly and she trembled violently .
Who -- WHO could this girl be ?
Under the new music teacher 's straw hat were masses of fine chestnut hair of the very shade and wave that the Old Lady remembered on another head in vanished years ; from under those waves looked large , violet-blue eyes with very black lashes and brows -- and the Old Lady knew those eyes as well as she knew her own ; and the new music teacher 's face , with all its beauty of delicate outline and dainty colouring and glad , buoyant youth , was a face from the Old Lady 's past -- a perfect resemblance in every respect save one ; the face which the Old Lady remembered had been weak , with all its charm ; but this girl 's face possessed a fine , dominant strength compact of sweetness and womanliness .
As she passed by the Old Lady 's hiding place she laughed at something one of the children said ; and oh , but the Old Lady knew that laughter well .
She had heard it before under that very beech tree .
She watched them until they disappeared over the wooded hill beyond the bridge ; and then she went back home as if she walked in a dream .
Crooked Jack was delving vigorously in the garden ; ordinarily the Old Lady did not talk much with Crooked Jack , for she disliked his weakness for gossip ; but now she went into the garden , a stately old figure in her purple , gold-spotted silk , with the sunshine gleaming on her white hair .
Crooked Jack had seen her go out and had remarked to himself that the Old Lady was losing ground ; she was pale and peaked-looking .
He now concluded that he had been mistaken .
The Old Lady 's cheeks were pink and her eyes shining .
Somewhere in her walk she had shed ten years at least .
Crooked Jack leaned on his spade and decided that there were n't many finer looking women anywhere than Old Lady Lloyd .
Pity she was such an old miser !
`` Mr. Spencer , '' said the Old Lady graciously -- she always spoke very graciously to her inferiors when she talked to them at all -- `` can you tell me the name of the new music teacher who is boarding at Mr. William Spencer 's ? ''
`` Sylvia Gray , '' said Crooked Jack .
The Old Lady 's heart gave another great bound .
But she had known it -- she had known that girl with Leslie Gray 's hair and eyes and laugh must be Leslie Gray 's daughter .
Crooked Jack spat on his hand and resumed his work , but his tongue went faster than his spade , and the Old Lady listened greedily .
For the first time she enjoyed and blessed Crooked Jack 's garrulity and gossip .
Every word he uttered was as an apple of gold in a picture of silver to her .
He had been working at William Spencer 's the day the new music teacher had come , and what Crooked Jack could n't find out about any person in one whole day -- at least as far as outward life went -- was hardly worth finding out .
Next to discovering things did he love telling them , and it would be hard to say which enjoyed that ensuing half-hour more -- Crooked Jack or the Old Lady .
Crooked Jack 's account , boiled down , amounted to this ; both Miss Gray 's parents had died when she was a baby , she had been brought up by an aunt , she was very poor and very ambitious .
`` Wants a moosical eddication , '' finished up Crooked Jack , `` and , by jingo , she orter have it , for anything like the voice of her I never heerd .
She sung for us that evening after supper and I thought 't was an angel singing .
It just went through me like a shaft o ' light .
The Spencer young ones are crazy over her already .
She 's got twenty pupils around here and in Grafton and Avonlea . ''
When the Old Lady had found out everything Crooked Jack could tell her , she went into the house and sat down by the window of her little sitting-room to think it all over .
She was tingling from head to foot with excitement .
Leslie 's daughter !
This Old Lady had had her romance once .
Long ago -- forty years ago -- she had been engaged to Leslie Gray , a young college student who taught in Spencervale for the summer term one year -- the golden summer of Margaret Lloyd 's life .
Leslie had been a shy , dreamy , handsome fellow with literary ambitions , which , as he and Margaret both firmly believed , would one day bring him fame and fortune .
Then there had been a foolish , bitter quarrel at the end of that golden summer .
Leslie had gone away in anger , afterwards he had written , but Margaret Lloyd , still in the grasp of her pride and resentment , had sent a harsh answer .
No more letters came ; Leslie Gray never returned ; and one day Margaret wakened to the realization that she had put love out of her life for ever .
She knew it would never be hers again ; and from that moment her feet were turned from youth to walk down the valley of shadow to a lonely , eccentric age .
Many years later she heard of Leslie 's marriage ; then came news of his death , after a life that had not fulfilled his dreams for him .
Nothing more she had heard or known -- nothing to this day , when she had seen his daughter pass her by unseeing in the beech hollow .
`` His daughter !
And she might have been MY daughter , '' murmured the Old Lady .
`` Oh , if I could only know her and love her -- and perhaps win her love in return !
But I can not .
I could not have Leslie Gray 's daughter know how poor I am -- how low I have been brought .
I could not bear that .
And to think she is living so near me , the darling -- just up the lane and over the hill .
I can see her go by every day -- I can have that dear pleasure , at least .
But oh , if I could only do something for her -- give her some little pleasure !
It would be such a delight . ''
When the Old Lady happened to go into her spare room that evening , she saw from it a light shining through a gap in the trees on the hill .
She knew that it shone from the Spencers ' spare room .
So it was Sylvia 's light .
The Old Lady stood in the darkness and watched it until it went out -- watched it with a great sweetness breathing in her heart , such as risen from old rose-leaves when they are stirred .
She fancied Sylvia moving about her room , brushing and braiding her long , glistening hair -- laying aside her little trinkets and girlish adornments -- making her simple preparations for sleep .
When the light went out the Old Lady pictured a slight white figure kneeling by the window in the soft starshine , and the Old Lady knelt down then and there and said her own prayers in fellowship .
She said the simple form of words she had always used ; but a new spirit seemed to inspire them ; and she finished with a new petition -- `` Let me think of something I can do for her , dear Father -- some little , little thing that I can do for her . ''
The Old Lady had slept in the same room all her life -- the one looking north into the spruces -- and loved it ; but the next day she moved into the spare room without a regret .
It was to be her room after this ; she must be where she could see Sylvia 's light , she put the bed where she could lie in it and look at that earth star which had suddenly shone across the twilight shadows of her heart .
She felt very happy , she had not felt happy for many years ; but now a strange , new , dream-like interest , remote from the harsh realities of her existence , but none the less comforting and alluring , had entered into her life .
Besides , she had thought of something she could do for Sylvia -- `` a little , little thing '' that might give her pleasure .
Spencervale people were wont to say regretfully that there were no Mayflowers in Spencervale ; the Spencervale young fry , when they wanted Mayflowers , thought they had to go over to the barrens at Avonlea , six miles away , for them .
Old Lady Lloyd knew better .
In her many long , solitary rambles , she had discovered a little clearing far back in the woods -- a southward-sloping , sandy hill on a tract of woodland belonging to a man who lived in town -- which in spring was starred over with the pink and white of arbutus .
To this clearing the Old Lady betook herself that afternoon , walking through wood lanes and under dim spruce arches like a woman with a glad purpose .
All at once the spring was dear and beautiful to her once more ; for love had entered again into her heart , and her starved soul was feasting on its divine nourishment .
Old Lady Lloyd found a wealth of Mayflowers on the sandy hill .
She filled her basket with them , gloating over the loveliness which was to give pleasure to Sylvia .
When she got home she wrote on a slip of paper , `` For Sylvia . ''
It was not likely anyone in Spencervale would know her handwriting , but , to make sure , she disguised it , writing in round , big letters like a child 's .
She carried her Mayflowers down to the hollow and heaped them in a recess between the big roots of the old beech , with the little note thrust through a stem on top .
Then the Old Lady deliberately hid behind the spruce clump .
She had put on her dark green silk on purpose for hiding .
She had not long to wait .
Soon Sylvia Gray came down the hill with Mattie Spencer .
When she reached the bridge she saw the Mayflowers and gave an exclamation of delight .
Then she saw her name and her expression changed to wonder .
The Old Lady , peering through the boughs , could have laughed for very pleasure over the success of her little plot .
`` For me ! ''
said Sylvia , lifting the flowers .
`` CAN they really be for me , Mattie ?
Who could have left them here ? ''
Mattie giggled .
`` I believe it was Chris Stewart , '' she said .
`` I know he was over at Avonlea last night .
And ma says he 's taken a notion to you -- she knows by the way he looked at you when you were singing night before last .
It would be just like him to do something queer like this -- he 's such a shy fellow with the girls . ''
Sylvia frowned a little .
She did not like Mattie 's expressions , but she did like Mayflowers , and she did not dislike Chris Stewart , who had seemed to her merely a nice , modest , country boy .
She lifted the flowers and buried her face in them .
`` Anyway , I 'm much obliged to the giver , whoever he or she is , '' she said merrily .
`` There 's nothing I love like Mayflowers .
Oh , how sweet they are ! ''
When they had passed the Old Lady emerged from her lurking place , flushed with triumph .
It did not vex her that Sylvia should think Chris Stewart had given her the flowers ; nay , it was all the better , since she would be the less likely to suspect the real donor .
The main thing was that Sylvia should have the delight of them .
That quite satisfied the Old Lady , who went back to her lonely house with the cockles of her heart all in a glow .
It soon was a matter of gossip in Spencervale that Chris Stewart was leaving Mayflowers at the beech hollow for the music teacher every other day .
Chris himself denied it , but he was not believed .
Firstly , there were no Mayflowers in Spencervale ; secondly , Chris had to go to Carmody every other day to haul milk to the butter factory , and Mayflowers grew in Carmody , and , thirdly , the Stewarts always had a romantic streak in them .
Was not that enough circumstantial evidence for anybody ?
As for Sylvia , she did not mind if Chris had a boyish admiration for her and expressed it thus delicately .
She thought it very nice of him , indeed , when he did not vex her with any other advances , and she was quite content to enjoy his Mayflowers .
Old Lady Lloyd heard all the gossip about it from the egg pedlar , and listened to him with laughter glimmering far down in her eyes .
The egg pedlar went away and vowed he 'd never seen the Old Lady so spry as she was this spring ; she seemed real interested in the young folk 's doings .
The Old Lady kept her secret and grew young in it .
She walked back to the Mayflower hill as long as the Mayflowers lasted ; and she always hid in the spruces to see Sylvia Gray go by .
Every day she loved her more , and yearned after her more deeply .
All the long repressed tenderness of her nature overflowed to this girl who was unconscious of it .
She was proud of Sylvia 's grace and beauty , and sweetness of voice and laughter .
She began to like the Spencer children because they worshipped Sylvia ; she envied Mrs. Spencer because the latter could minister to Sylvia 's needs .
Even the egg pedlar seemed a delightful person because he brought news of Sylvia -- her social popularity , her professional success , the love and admiration she had won already .
The Old Lady never dreamed of revealing herself to Sylvia .
That , in her poverty , was not to be thought of for a moment .
It would have been very sweet to know her -- sweet to have her come to the old house -- sweet to talk to her -- to enter into her life .
But it might not be .
The Old Lady 's pride was still far stronger than her love .
It was the one thing she had never sacrificed and never -- so she believed -- could sacrifice .
II .
The June Chapter There were no Mayflowers in June ; but now the Old Lady 's garden was full of blossoms and every morning Sylvia found a bouquet of them by the beech -- the perfumed ivory of white narcissus , the flame of tulips , the fairy branches of bleeding-heart , the pink-and-snow of little , thorny , single , sweetbreathed early roses .
The Old Lady had no fear of discovery , for the flowers that grew in her garden grew in every other Spencervale garden as well , including the Stewart garden .
Chris Stewart , when he was teased about the music teacher , merely smiled and held his peace .
Chris knew perfectly well who was the real giver of those flowers .
He had made it his business to find out when the Mayflower gossip started .
But since it was evident Old Lady Lloyd did not wish it to be known , Chris told no one .
Chris had always liked Old Lady Lloyd ever since the day , ten years before , when she had found him crying in the woods with a cut foot and had taken him into her house , and bathed and bound the wound , and given him ten cents to buy candy at the store .
The Old Lady went without supper that night because of it , but Chris never knew that .
The Old Lady thought it a most beautiful June .
She no longer hated the new days ; on the contrary , she welcomed them .
`` Every day is an uncommon day now , '' she said jubilantly to herself -- for did not almost every day bring her a glimpse of Sylvia ?
Even on rainy days the Old Lady gallantly braved rheumatism to hide behind her clump of dripping spruces and watch Sylvia pass .
The only days she could not see her were Sundays ; and no Sundays had ever seemed so long to Old Lady Lloyd as those June Sundays did .
One day the egg pedlar had news for her .
`` The music teacher is going to sing a solo for a collection piece to-morrow , '' he told her .
The Old Lady 's black eyes flashed with interest .
`` I did n't know Miss Gray was a member of the choir , '' she said .
`` Jined two Sundays ago .
I tell you , our music is something worth listening to now .
The church 'll be packed to-morrow , I reckon -- her name 's gone all over the country for singing .
You ought to come and hear it , Miss Lloyd . ''
The pedlar said this out of bravado , merely to show he was n't scared of the Old Lady , for all her grand airs .
The Old Lady made no answer , and he thought he had offended her .
He went away , wishing he had n't said it .
Had he but known it , the Old Lady had forgotten the existence of all and any egg pedlars .
He had blotted himself and his insignificance out of her consciousness by his last sentence .
All her thoughts , feelings , and wishes were submerged in a very whirlpool of desire to hear Sylvia sing that solo .
She went into the house in a tumult and tried to conquer that desire .
She could not do it , even thought she summoned all her pride to her aid .
Pride said : `` You will have to go to church to hear her .
You have n't fit clothes to go to church in .
Think what a figure you will make before them all . ''
But , for the first time , a more insistent voice than pride spoke to her soul -- and , for the first time , the Old Lady listened to it .
It was too true that she had never gone to church since the day on which she had to begin wearing her mother 's silk dresses .
The Old Lady herself thought that this was very wicked ; and she tried to atone by keeping Sunday very strictly , and always having a little service of her own , morning and evening .
She sang three hymns in her cracked voice , prayed aloud , and read a sermon .
But she could not bring herself to go to church in her out-of-date clothes -- she , who had once set the fashions in Spencervale , and the longer she stayed away , the more impossible it seemed that she should ever again go .
Now the impossible had become , not only possible , but insistent .
She must go to church and hear Sylvia sing , no matter how ridiculous she appeared , no matter how people talked and laughed at her .
Spencervale congregation had a mild sensation the next afternoon .
Just before the opening of service Old Lady Lloyd walked up the aisle and sat down in the long-unoccupied Lloyd pew , in front of the pulpit .
The Old Lady 's very soul was writhing within her .
She recalled the reflection she had seen in her mirror before she left -- the old black silk in the mode of thirty years agone and the queer little bonnet of shirred black satin .
She thought how absurd she must look in the eyes of her world .
As a matter of fact , she did not look in the least absurd .
Some women might have ; but the Old Lady 's stately distinction of carriage and figure was so subtly commanding that it did away with the consideration of garmenting altogether .
The Old Lady did not know this .
But she did know that Mrs. Kimball , the storekeeper 's wife , presently rustled into the next pew in the very latest fashion of fabric and mode ; she and Mrs. Kimball were the same age , and there had been a time when the latter had been content to imitate Margaret Lloyd 's costumes at a humble distance .
But the storekeeper had proposed , and things were changed now ; and there sat poor Old Lady Lloyd , feeling the change bitterly , and half wishing she had not come to church at all .
Then all at once the Angel of Love touched there foolish thoughts , born of vanity and morbid pride , and they melted away as if they had never been .
Sylvia Gray had come into the choir , and was sitting just where the afternoon sunshine fell over her beautiful hair like a halo .
The Old Lady looked at her in a rapture of satisfied longing and thenceforth the service was blessed to her , as anything is blessed which comes through the medium of unselfish love , whether human or divine .
Nay , are they not one and the same , differing in degree only , not in kind ?
The Old Lady had never had such a good , satisfying look at Sylvia before .
All her former glimpses had been stolen and fleeting .
Now she sat and gazed upon her to her hungry heart 's content , lingering delightedly over every little charm and loveliness -- the way Sylvia 's shining hair rippled back from her forehead , the sweet little trick she had of dropping quickly her long-lashed eyelids when she encountered too bold or curious a glance , and the slender , beautifully modelled hands -- so like Leslie Gray 's hands -- that held her hymn book .
She was dressed very plainly in a black skirt and a white shirtwaist ; but none of the other girls in the choir , with all their fine feathers , could hold a candle to her -- as the egg pedlar said to his wife , going home from church .
The Old Lady listened to the opening hymns with keen pleasure .
Sylvia 's voice thrilled through and dominated them all .
But when the ushers got up to take the collection , an undercurrent of subdued excitement flowed over the congregation .
Sylvia rose and came forward to Janet Moore 's side at the organ .
The next moment her beautiful voice soared through the building like the very soul of melody -- true , clear , powerful , sweet .
Nobody in Spencervale had ever listened to such a voice , except Old Lady Lloyd herself , who , in her youth , had heard enough good singing to enable her to be a tolerable judge of it .
She realized instantly that this girl of her heart had a great gift -- a gift that would some day bring her fame and fortune , if it could be duly trained and developed .
`` Oh , I 'm so glad I came to church , '' thought Old Lady Lloyd .
When the solo was ended , the Old Lady 's conscience compelled her to drag her eyes and thoughts from Sylvia , and fasten them on the minister , who had been flattering himself all through the opening portion of the service that Old Lady Lloyd had come to church on his account .
He was newly settled , having been in charge of the Spencervale congregation only a few months ; he was a clever little fellow and he honestly thought it was the fame of his preaching that had brought Old Lady Lloyd out to church .
When the service was over all the Old Lady 's neighbours came to speak to her , with kindly smile and handshake .
They thought they ought to encourage her , now that she had made a start in the right direction ; the Old Lady liked their cordiality , and liked it none the less because she detected in it the same unconscious respect and deference she had been wont to receive in the old days -- a respect and deference which her personality compelled from all who approached her .
The Old Lady was surprised to find that she could command it still , in defiance of unfashionable bonnet and ancient attire .
Janet Moore and Sylvia Gray walked home from church together .
`` Did you see Old Lady Lloyd out to-day ? ''
asked Janet .
`` I was amazed when she walked in .
She has never been to church in my recollection .
What a quaint old figure she is !
She 's very rich , you know , but she wears her mother 's old clothes and never gets a new thing .
Some people think she is mean ; but , '' concluded Janet charitably , `` I believe it is simply eccentricity . ''
`` I felt that was Miss Lloyd as soon as I saw her , although I had never seen her before , '' said Sylvia dreamily .
`` I have been wishing to see her -- for a certain reason .
She has a very striking face .
I should like to meet her -- to know her . ''
`` I do n't think it 's likely you ever will , '' said Janet carelessly .
`` She does n't like young people and she never goes anywhere .
I do n't think I 'd like to know her .
I 'd be afraid of her -- she has such stately ways and such strange , piercing eyes . '' ''
I should n't be afraid of her , '' said Sylvia to herself , as she turned into the Spencer lane .
`` But I do n't expect I 'll ever become acquainted with her .
If she knew who I am I suppose she would dislike me .
I suppose she never suspects that I am Leslie Gray 's daughter . ''
The minister , thinking it well to strike while the iron was hot , went up to call on Old Lady Lloyd the very next afternoon .
He went in fear and trembling , for he had heard things about Old Lady Lloyd ; but she made herself so agreeable in her high-bred fashion that he was delighted , and told his wife when he went home that Spencervale people did n't understand Miss Lloyd .
This was perfectly true ; but it is by no means certain that the minister understood her either .
He made only one mistake in tact , but , as the Old Lady did not snub him for it , he never knew he made it .
When he was leaving he said , `` I hope we shall see you at church next Sunday , Miss Lloyd . ''
`` Indeed , you will , '' said the Old Lady emphatically .
III .
The July Chapter The first day of July Sylvia found a little birch bark boat full of strawberries at the beech in the hollow .
They were the earliest of the season ; the Old Lady had found them in one of her secret haunts .
They would have been a toothsome addition to the Old Lady 's own slender bill of fare ; but she never thought of eating them .
She got far more pleasure out of the thought of Sylvia 's enjoying them for her tea .
Thereafter the strawberries alternated with the flowers as long as they lasted , and then came blueberries and raspberries .
The blueberries grew far away and the Old Lady had many a tramp after them .
Sometimes her bones ached at night because of it ; but what cared the Old Lady for that ?
Bone ache is easier to endure than soul ache ; and the Old Lady 's soul had stopped aching for the first time in many year .
It was being nourished with heavenly manna .
One evening Crooked Jack came up to fix something that had gone wrong with the Old Lady 's well .
The Old Lady wandered affably out to him ; for she knew he had been working at the Spencers ' all day , and there might be crumbs of information about Sylvia to be picked up .
`` I reckon the music teacher 's feeling pretty blue this evening , '' Crooked Jack remarked , after straining the Old Lady 's patience to the last verge of human endurance by expatiating on William Spencer 's new pump , and Mrs. Spencer 's new washing-machine , and Amelia Spencer 's new young man .
`` Why ? ''
asked the Old Lady , turning very pale .
Had anything happened to Sylvia ?
`` Well , she 's been invited to a big party at Mrs. Moore 's brother 's in town , and she has n't got a dress to go in , '' said Crooked Jack .
`` They 're great swells and everybody will be got up regardless .
Mrs. Spencer was telling me about it .
She says Miss Gray ca n't afford a new dress because she 's helping to pay her aunt 's doctor 's bills .
She says she 's sure Miss Gray feels awful disappointed over it , though she does n't let on .
But Mrs. Spencer says she knows she was crying after she went to bed last night . ''
The Old Lady turned and went into the house abruptly .
This was dreadful .
Sylvia must go to that party -- she MUST .
But how was it to be managed ?
Through the Old Lady 's brain passed wild thoughts of her mother 's silk dresses .
But none of them would be suitable , even if there were time to make one over .
Never had the Old Lady so bitterly regretted her vanished wealth .
`` I 've only two dollars in the house , '' she said , `` and I 've got to live on that till the next day the egg pedlar comes round .
Is there anything I can sell -- ANYTHING ?
Yes , yes , the grape jug ! ''
Up to this time , the Old Lady would as soon have thought of trying to sell her head as the grape jug .
The grape jug was two hundred years old and had been in the Lloyd family ever since it was a jug at all .
It was a big , pot-bellied affair , festooned with pink-gilt grapes , and with a verse of poetry printed on one side , and it had been given as a wedding present to the Old Lady 's great-grandmother .
As long as the Old Lady could remember it had sat on the top shelf in the cupboard in the sitting-room wall , far too precious ever to be used .
Two years before , a woman who collected old china had explored Spencervale , and , getting word of the grape jug , had boldly invaded the old Lloyd place and offered to buy it .
She never , to her dying day , forgot the reception the Old Lady gave her ; but , being wise in her day and generation , she left her card , saying that if Miss Lloyd ever changed her mind about selling the jug , she would find that she , the aforesaid collector , had not changed hers about buying it .
People who make a hobby of heirloom china must meekly overlook snubs , and this particular person had never seen anything she coveted so much as that grape jug .
The Old Lady had torn the card to pieces ; but she remembered the name and address .
She went to the cupboard and took down the beloved jug .
`` I never thought to part with it , '' she said wistfully , `` but Sylvia must have a dress , and there is no other way .
And , after all , when I 'm gone , who would there be to have it ?
Strangers would get it then -- it might as well go to them now .
I 'll have to go to town to-morrow morning , for there 's no time to lose if the party is Friday night .
I have n't been to town for ten years .
I dread the thought of going , more than parting with the jug .
But for Sylvia 's sake ! ''
It was all over Spencervale by the next morning that Old Lady Lloyd had gone to town , carrying a carefully guarded box .
Everybody wondered why she went ; most people supposed she had become too frightened to keep her money in a black box below her bed , when there had been two burglaries over at Carmody , and had taken it to the bank .
The Old Lady sought out the address of the china collector , trembling with fear that she might be dead or gone .
But the collector was there , very much alive , and as keenly anxious to possess the grape jug as ever .
The Old Lady , pallid with the pain of her trampled pride , sold the grape jug and went away , believing that her great-grandmother must have turned over in her grave at the moment of the transaction .
Old Lady Lloyd felt like a traitor to her traditions .
But she went unflinchingly to a big store and , guided by that special Providence which looks after simple-minded old souls in their dangerous excursions into the world , found a sympathetic clerk who knew just what she wanted and got it for her .
The Old Lady selected a very dainty muslin gown , with gloves and slippers in keeping ; and she ordered it sent at once , expressage prepaid , to Miss Sylvia Gray , in care of William Spencer , Spencervale .
Then she paid down the money -- the whole price of the jug , minus a dollar and a half for railroad fare -- with a grand , careless air and departed .
As she marched erectly down the aisle of the store , she encountered a sleek , portly , prosperous man coming in .
As their eyes met , the man started and his bland face flushed crimson ; he lifted his hat and bowed confusedly .
But the Old Lady looked through him as if he was n't there , and passed on with not a sign of recognition about her .
He took one step after her , then stopped and turned away , with a rather disagreeable smile and a shrug of his shoulders .
Nobody would have guessed , as the Old Lady swept out , how her heart was seething with abhorrence and scorn .
She would not have had the courage to come to town , even for Sylvia 's sake , if she had thought she would meet Andrew Cameron .
The mere sight of him opened up anew a sealed fountain of bitterness in her soul ; but the thought of Sylvia somehow stemmed the torrent , and presently the Old Lady was smiling rather triumphantly , thinking rightly that she had come off best in that unwelcome encounter .
SHE , at any rate , had not faltered and coloured , and lost her presence of mind .
`` It is little wonder HE did , '' thought the Old Lady vindictively .
It pleased her that Andrew Cameron should lose , before her , the front of adamant he presented to the world .
He was her cousin and the only living creature Old Lady Lloyd hated , and she hated and despised him with all the intensity of her intense nature .
She and hers had sustained grievous wrong at his hands , and the Old Lady was convinced that she would rather die than take any notice of his existence .
Presently , she resolutely put Andrew Cameron out of her mind .
It was desecration to think of him and Sylvia together .
When she laid her weary head on her pillow that night she was so happy that even the thought of the vacant shelf in the room below , where the grape jug had always been , gave her only a momentary pang .
`` It 's sweet to sacrifice for one we love -- it 's sweet to have someone to sacrifice for , '' thought the Old Lady .
Desire grows by what it feeds on .
The Old Lady thought she was content ; but Friday evening came and found her in a perfect fever to see Sylvia in her party dress .
It was not enough to fancy her in it ; nothing would do the Old Lady but seeing her .
`` And I SHALL see her , '' said the Old Lady resolutely , looking out from her window at Sylvia 's light gleaming through the firs .
She wrapped herself in a dark shawl and crept out , slipping down to the hollow and up the wood lane .
It was a misty , moonlight night , and a wind , fragrant with the aroma of clover fields , blew down the lane to meet her .
`` I wish I could take your perfume -- the soul of you -- and pour it into her life , '' said the Old Lady aloud to that wind .
Sylvia Gray was standing in her room , ready for the party .
Before her stood Mrs. Spencer and Amelia Spencer and all the little Spencer girls , in an admiring semi-circle .
There was another spectator .
Outside , under the lilac bush , Old Lady Lloyd was standing .
She could see Sylvia plainly , in her dainty dress , with the pale pink roses Old Lady Lloyd had left at the beech that day for her in her hair .
Pink as they were , they were not so pink as her cheeks , and her eyes shone like stars .
Amelia Spencer put up her hand to push back a rose that had fallen a little out of place , and the Old Lady envied her fiercely .
`` That dress could n't have fitted better if it had been made for you , '' said Mrs. Spencer admiringly .
`` Ai n't she lovely , Amelia ?
Who COULD have sent it ? ''
`` Oh , I feel sure that Mrs. Moore was the fairy godmother , '' said Sylvia .
`` There is nobody else who would .
It was dear of her -- she knew I wished so much to go to the party with Janet .
I wish Aunty could see me now . ''
Sylvia gave a little sigh in spite of her joy .
`` There 's nobody else to care very much . ''
Ah , Sylvia , you were wrong !
There was somebody else -- somebody who cared very much -- an Old Lady , with eager , devouring eyes , who was standing under the lilac bush and who presently stole away through the moonlit orchard to the woods like a shadow , going home with a vision of you in your girlish beauty to companion her through the watches of that summer night .
IV .
The August Chapter One day the minister 's wife rushed in where Spencervale people had feared to tread , went boldly to Old Lady Lloyd , and asked her if she would n't come to their Sewing Circle , which met fortnightly on Saturday afternoons .
`` We are filling a box to send to our Trinidad missionary , '' said the minister 's wife , `` and we should be so pleased to have you come , Miss Lloyd . ''
The Old Lady was on the point of refusing rather haughtily .
Not that she was opposed to missions -- or sewing circles either -- quite the contrary , but she knew that each member of the Circle was expected to pay ten cents a week for the purpose of procuring sewing materials ; and the poor Old Lady really did not see how she could afford it .
But a sudden thought checked her refusal before it reached her lips .
`` I suppose some of the young girls go to the Circle ? ''
she said craftily .
`` Oh , they all go , '' said the minister 's wife .
`` Janet Moore and Miss Gray are our most enthusiastic members .
It is very lovely of Miss Gray to give her Saturday afternoons -- the only ones she has free from pupils -- to our work .
But she really has the sweetest disposition . ''
`` I 'll join your Circle , '' said the Old Lady promptly .
She was determined she would do it , if she had to live on two meals a day to save the necessary fee .
She went to the Sewing Circle at James Martin 's the next Saturday , and did the most beautiful hand sewing for them .
She was so expert at it that she did n't need to think about it at all , which was rather fortunate , for all her thoughts were taken up with Sylvia , who sat in the opposite corner with Janet Moore , her graceful hands busy with a little boy 's coarse gingham shirt .
Nobody thought of introducing Sylvia to Old Lady Lloyd , and the Old Lady was glad of it .
She sewed finely away , and listened with all her ears to the girlish chatter which went on in the opposite corner .
One thing she found out -- Sylvia 's birthday was the twentieth of August .
And the Old Lady was straightway fired with a consuming wish to give Sylvia a birthday present .
She lay awake most of the night wondering if she could do it , and most sorrowfully concluded that it was utterly out of the question , no matter how she might pinch and contrive .
Old Lady Lloyd worried quite absurdly over this , and it haunted her like a spectre until the next Sewing Circle day .
It met at Mrs. Moore 's and Mrs. Moore was especially gracious to Old Lady Lloyd , and insisted on her taking the wicker rocker in the parlour .
The Old Lady would rather have been in the sitting-room with the young girls , but she submitted for courtesy 's sake -- and she had her reward .
Her chair was just behind the parlour door , and presently Janet Moore and Sylvia Gray came and sat on the stairs in the hall outside , where a cool breeze blew in through the maples before the front door .
They were talking of their favourite poets .
Janet , it appeared , adored Byron and Scott .
Sylvia leaned to Tennyson and Browning .
`` Do you know , '' said Sylvia softly , `` my father was a poet ?
He published a little volume of verse once ; and , Janet , I 've never seen a copy of it , and oh , how I would love to !
It was published when he was at college -- just a small , private edition to give his friends .
He never published any more -- poor father !
I think life disappointed him .
But I have such a longing to see that little book of his verse .
I have n't a scrap of his writings .
If I had it would seem as if I possessed something of him -- of his heart , his soul , his inner life .
He would be something more than a mere name to me . ''
`` Did n't he have a copy of his own -- did n't your mother have one ? ''
asked Janet .
`` Mother had n't .
She died when I was born , you know , but Aunty says there was no copy of father 's poems among mother 's books .
Mother did n't care for poetry , Aunty says -- Aunty does n't either .
Father went to Europe after mother died , and he died there the next year .
Nothing that he had with him was ever sent home to us .
He had sold most of his books before he went , but he gave a few of his favourite ones to Aunty to keep for me .
HIS book was n't among them .
I do n't suppose I shall ever find a copy , but I should be so delighted if I only could . ''
When the Old Lady got home she took from her top bureau drawer an inlaid box of sandalwood .
It held a little , slim , limp volume , wrapped in tissue paper -- the Old Lady 's most treasured possession .
On the fly-leaf was written , `` To Margaret , with the author 's love . ''
The Old Lady turned the yellow leaves with trembling fingers and , through eyes brimming with tears , read the verses , although she had known them all by heart for years .
She meant to give the book to Sylvia for a birthday present -- one of the most precious gifts ever given , if the value of gifts is gauged by the measure of self-sacrifice involved .
In that little book was immortal love -- old laughter -- old tears -- old beauty which had bloomed like a rose years ago , holding still its sweetness like old rose leaves .
She removed the telltale fly-leaf ; and late on the night before Sylvia 's birthday , the Old Lady crept , under cover of the darkness , through byways and across fields , as if bent on some nefarious expedition , to the little Spencervale store where the post-office was kept .
She slipped the thin parcel through the slit in the door , and then stole home again , feeling a strange sense of loss and loneliness .
It was as if she had given away the last link between herself and her youth .
But she did not regret it .
It would give Sylvia pleasure , and that had come to be the overmastering passion of the Old Lady 's heart .
The next night the light in Sylvia 's room burned very late , and the Old Lady watched it triumphantly , knowing the meaning of it .
Sylvia was reading her father 's poems , and the Old Lady in her darkness read them too , murmuring the lines over and over to herself .
After all , giving away the book had not mattered so very much .
She had the soul of it still -- and the fly-leaf with the name , in Leslie 's writing , by which nobody ever called her now .
The Old Lady was sitting on the Marshall sofa the next Sewing Circle afternoon when Sylvia Gray came and sat down beside her .
The Old Lady 's hands trembled a little , and one side of a handkerchief , which was afterwards given as a Christmas present to a little olive-skinned coolie in Trinidad , was not quite so exquisitely done as the other three sides .
Sylvia at first talked of the Circle , and Mrs. Marshall 's dahlias , and the Old Lady was in the seventh heaven of delight , though she took care not to show it , and was even a little more stately and finely mannered than usual .
When she asked Sylvia how she liked living in Spencervale , Sylvia said , `` Very much .
Everybody is so kind to me .
Besides '' -- Sylvia lowered her voice so that nobody but the Old Lady could hear it -- `` I have a fairy godmother here who does the most beautiful and wonderful things for me . ''
Sylvia , being a girl of fine instincts , did not look at Old Lady Lloyd as she said this .
But she would not have seen anything if she had looked .
The Old Lady was not a Lloyd for nothing .
`` How very interesting , '' she said , indifferently .
`` Is n't it ?
I am so grateful to her and I have wished so much she might know how much pleasure she has given me .
I have found lovely flowers and delicious berries on my path all summer ; I feel sure she sent me my party dress .
But the dearest gift came last week on my birthday -- a little volume of my father 's poems .
I ca n't express what I felt on receiving them .
But I longed to meet my fairy godmother and thank her . ''
`` Quite a fascinating mystery , is n't it ?
Have you really no idea who she is ? ''
The Old Lady asked this dangerous question with marked success .
She would not have been so successful if she had not been so sure that Sylvia had no idea of the old romance between her and Leslie Gray .
As it was , she had a comfortable conviction that she herself was the very last person Sylvia would be likely to suspect .
Sylvia hesitated for an almost unnoticeable moment .
Then she said , `` I have n't tried to find out , because I do n't think she wants me to know .
At first , of course , in the matter of the flowers and dress , I did try to solve the mystery ; but , since I received the book , I became convinced that it was my fairy godmother who was doing it all , and I have respected her wish for concealment and always shall .
Perhaps some day she will reveal herself to me .
I hope so , at least . ''
`` I would n't hope it , '' said the Old Lady discouragingly .
`` Fairy godmothers -- at least , in all the fairy tales I ever read -- are somewhat apt to be queer , crochety people , much more agreeable when wrapped up in mystery than when met face to face . ''
`` I 'm convinced that mine is the very opposite , and that the better I became acquainted with her , the more charming a personage I should find her , '' said Sylvia gaily .
Mrs. Marshall came up at this juncture and entreated Miss Gray to sing for them .
Miss Gray consenting sweetly , the Old Lady was left alone and was rather glad of it .
She enjoyed her conversation with Sylvia much more in thinking it over after she got home than while it was taking place .
When an Old Lady has a guilty conscience , it is apt to make her nervous and distract her thoughts from immediate pleasure .
She wondered a little uneasily if Sylvia really did suspect her .
Then she concluded that it was out of the question .
Who would suspect a mean , unsociable Old Lady , who had no friends , and who gave only five cents to the Sewing Circle when everyone else gave ten or fifteen , to be a fairy godmother , the donor of beautiful party dresses , and the recipient of gifts from romantic , aspiring young poets ?
V .
The September Chapter In September the Old Lady looked back on the summer and owned to herself that it had been a strangely happy one , with Sundays and Sewing Circle days standing out like golden punctuation marks in a poem of life .
She felt like an utterly different woman ; and other people thought her different also .
The Sewing Circle women found her so pleasant , and even friendly , that they began to think they had misjudged her , and that perhaps it was eccentricity after all , and not meanness , which accounted for her peculiar mode of living .
Sylvia Gray always came and talked to her on Circle afternoons now , and the Old Lady treasured every word she said in her heart and repeated them over and over to her lonely self in the watches of the night .
Sylvia never talked of herself or her plans , unless asked about them ; and the Old Lady 's self-consciousness prevented her from asking any personal questions : so their conversation kept to the surface of things , and it was not from Sylvia , but from the minister 's wife that the Old Lady finally discovered what her darling 's dearest ambition was .
The minister 's wife had dropped in at the old Lloyd place one evening late in September , when a chilly wind was blowing up from the northeast and moaning about the eaves of the house , as if the burden of its lay were `` harvest is ended and summer is gone . ''
The Old Lady had been listening to it , as she plaited a little basket of sweet grass for Sylvia .
She had walked all the way to Avonlea sand-hills for it the day before , and she was very tired .
And her heart was sad .
This summer , which had so enriched her life , was almost over ; and she knew that Sylvia Gray talked of leaving Spencervale at the end of October .
The Old Lady 's heart felt like very lead within her at the thought , and she almost welcomed the advent of the minister 's wife as a distraction , although she was desperately afraid that the minister 's wife had called to ask for a subscription for the new vestry carpet , and the Old Lady simply could not afford to give one cent .
But the minister 's wife had merely dropped in on her way home from the Spencers ' and she did not make any embarrassing requests .
Instead , she talked about Sylvia Gray , and her words fell on the Old Lady 's ears like separate pearl notes of unutterably sweet music .
The minister 's wife had nothing but praise for Sylvia -- she was so sweet and beautiful and winning .
`` And with SUCH a voice , '' said the minister 's wife enthusiastically , adding with a sigh , `` It 's such a shame she ca n't have it properly trained .
She would certainly become a great singer -- competent critics have told her so .
But she is so poor she does n't think she can ever possibly manage it -- unless she can get one of the Cameron scholarships , as they are called ; and she has very little hope of that , although the professor of music who taught her has sent her name in . ''
`` What are the Cameron scholarships ? ''
asked the Old Lady .
`` Well , I suppose you have heard of Andrew Cameron , the millionaire ? ''
said the minister 's wife , serenely unconscious that she was causing the very bones of the Old Lady 's family skeleton to jangle in their closet .
Into the Old Lady 's white face came a sudden faint stain of colour , as if a rough hand had struck her cheek .
`` Yes , I 've heard of him , '' she said .
`` Well , it seems that he had a daughter , who was a very beautiful girl , and whom he idolized .
She had a fine voice , and he was going to send her abroad to have it trained .
And she died .
It nearly broke his heart , I understand .
But ever since , he sends one young girl away to Europe every year for a thorough musical education under the best teachers -- in memory of his daughter .
He has sent nine or ten already ; but I fear there is n't much chance for Sylvia Gray , and she does n't think there is herself . ''
`` Why not ? ''
asked the Old Lady spiritedly .
`` I am sure that there can be few voices equal to Miss Gray 's . ''
`` Very true .
But you see , these so-called scholarships are private affairs , dependent solely on the whim and choice of Andrew Cameron himself .
Of course , when a girl has friends who use their influence with him , he will often send her on their recommendation .
They say he sent a girl last year who had n't much of a voice at all just because her father had been an old business crony of his .
But Sylvia does n't know anyone at all who would , to use a slang term , have any ` pull ' with Andrew Cameron , and she is not acquainted with him herself .
Well , I must be going ; we 'll see you at the Manse on Saturday , I hope , Miss Lloyd .
The Circle meets there , you know . ''
`` Yes , I know , '' said the Old Lady absently .
When the minister 's wife had gone , she dropped her sweetgrass basket and sat for a long , long time with her hands lying idly in her lap , and her big black eyes staring unseeingly at the wall before her .
Old Lady Lloyd , so pitifully poor that she had to eat six crackers the less a week to pay her fee to the Sewing Circle , knew that it was in her power -- HERS -- to send Leslie Gray 's daughter to Europe for her musical education !
If she chose to use her `` pull '' with Andrew Cameron -- if she went to him and asked him to send Sylvia Gray abroad the next year -- she had no doubt whatever that it would be done .
It all lay with her -- if -- if -- IF she could so far crush and conquer her pride as to stoop to ask a favour of the man who had wronged her and hers so bitterly .
Years ago , her father , acting under the advice and urgency of Andrew Cameron , had invested all his little fortune in an enterprise that had turned out a failure .
Abraham Lloyd lost every dollar he possessed , and his family were reduced to utter poverty .
Andrew Cameron might have been forgiven for a mistake ; but there was a strong suspicion , amounting to almost certainty , that he had been guilty of something far worse than a mistake in regard to his uncle 's investment .
Nothing could be legally proved ; but it was certain that Andrew Cameron , already noted for his `` sharp practices , '' emerged with improved finances from an entanglement that had ruined many better men ; and old Doctor Lloyd had died brokenhearted , believing that his nephew had deliberately victimized him .
Andrew Cameron had not quite done this ; he had meant well enough by his uncle at first , and what he had finally done he tried to justify to himself by the doctrine that a man must look out for Number One .
Margaret Lloyd made no such excuses for him ; she held him responsible , not only for her lost fortune , but for her father 's death , and never forgave him for it .
When Abraham Lloyd had died , Andrew Cameron , perhaps pricked by his conscience , had come to her , sleekly and smoothly , to offer her financial aid .
He would see , he told her , that she never suffered want .
Margaret Lloyd flung his offer back in his face after a fashion that left nothing to be desired in the way of plain speaking .
She would die , she told him passionately , before she would accept a penny or a favour from him .
He had preserved an unbroken show of good temper , expressed his heartfelt regret that she should cherish such an unjust opinion of him , and had left her with an oily assurance that he would always be her friend , and would always be delighted to render her any assistance in his power whenever she should choose to ask for it .
The Old Lady had lived for twenty years in the firm conviction that she would die in the poorhouse -- as , indeed , seemed not unlikely -- before she would ask a favour of Andrew Cameron .
And so , in truth , she would have , had it been for herself .
But for Sylvia !
Could she so far humble herself for Sylvia 's sake ?
The question was not easily or speedily settled , as had been the case in the matters of the grape jug and the book of poems .
For a whole week the Old Lady fought her pride and bitterness .
Sometimes , in the hours of sleepless night , when all human resentments and rancours seemed petty and contemptible , she thought she had conquered it .
But in the daytime , with the picture of her father looking down at her from the wall , and the rustle of her unfashionable dresses , worn because of Andrew Cameron 's double dealing , in her ears , it got the better of her again .
But the Old Lady 's love for Sylvia had grown so strong and deep and tender that no other feeling could endure finally against it .
Love is a great miracle worker ; and never had its power been more strongly made manifest than on the cold , dull autumn morning when the Old Lady walked to Bright River railway station and took the train to Charlottetown , bent on an errand the very thought of which turned her soul sick within her .
The station master who sold her her ticket thought Old Lady Lloyd looked uncommonly white and peaked -- `` as if she had n't slept a wink or eaten a bite for a week , '' he told his wife at dinner time .
`` Guess there 's something wrong in her business affairs .
This is the second time she 's gone to town this summer . ''
When the Old Lady reached the town , she ate her slender little lunch and then walked out to the suburb where the Cameron factories and warehouses were .
It was a long walk for her , but she could not afford to drive .
She felt very tired when she was shown into the shining , luxurious office where Andrew Cameron sat at his desk .
After the first startled glance of surprise , he came forward beamingly , with outstretched hand .
`` Why , Cousin Margaret !
This is a pleasant surprise .
Sit down -- allow me , this is a much more comfortable chair .
Did you come in this morning ?
And how is everybody out in Spencervale ? ''
The Old Lady had flushed at his first words .
To hear the name by which her father and mother and lover had called her on Andrew Cameron 's lips seemed like profanation .
But , she told herself , the time was past for squeamishness .
If she could ask a favour of Andrew Cameron , she could bear lesser pangs .
For Sylvia 's sake she shook hands with him , for Sylvia 's sake she sat down in the chair he offered .
But for no living human being 's sake could this determined Old Lady infuse any cordiality into her manner or her words .
She went straight to the point with Lloyd simplicity .
`` I have come to ask a favour of you , '' she said , looking him in the eye , not at all humbly or meekly , as became a suppliant , but challengingly and defiantly , as if she dared him to refuse .
`` DE-lighted to hear it , Cousin Margaret . ''
Never was anything so bland and gracious as his tone .
`` Anything I can do for you I shall be only too pleased to do .
I am afraid you have looked upon me as an enemy , Margaret , and I assure you I have felt your injustice keenly .
I realize that some appearances were against me , but -- '' The Old Lady lifted her hand and stemmed his eloquence by that one gesture .
`` I did not come here to discuss that matter , '' she said .
`` We will not refer to the past , if you please .
I came to ask a favour , not for myself , but for a very dear young friend of mine -- a Miss Gray , who has a remarkably fine voice which she wishes to have trained .
She is poor , so I came to ask you if you would give her one of your musical scholarships .
I understand her name has already been suggested to you , with a recommendation from her teacher .
I do not know what he has said of her voice , but I do know he could hardly overrate it .
If you send her abroad for training , you will not make any mistake . ''
The Old Lady stopped talking .
She felt sure Andrew Cameron would grant her request , but she did hope he would grant it rather rudely or unwillingly .
She could accept the favour so much more easily if it were flung to her like a bone to a dog .
But not a bit of it .
Andrew Cameron was suaver than ever .
Nothing could give him greater pleasure than to grant his dear Cousin Margaret 's request -- he only wished it involved more trouble on his part .
Her little protege should have her musical education assuredly -- she should go abroad next year -- and he was DE-lighted -- `` Thank you , '' said the Old Lady , cutting him short again .
`` I am much obliged to you -- and I ask you not to let Miss Gray know anything of my interference .
And I shall not take up any more of your valuable time .
Good afternoon . ''
`` Oh , you must n't go so soon , '' he said , with some real kindness or clannishness permeating the hateful cordiality of his voice -- for Andrew Cameron was not entirely without the homely virtues of the average man .
He had been a good husband and father ; he had once been very fond of his Cousin Margaret ; and he was really very sorry that `` circumstances '' had `` compelled '' him to act as he had done in that old affair of her father 's investment .
`` You must be my guest to-night . ''
`` Thank you .
I must return home to-night , '' said the Old Lady firmly , and there was that in her tone which told Andrew Cameron that it would be useless to urge her .
But he insisted on telephoning for his carriage to drive her to the station .
The Old Lady submitted to this , because she was secretly afraid her own legs would not suffice to carry her there ; she even shook hands with him at parting , and thanked him a second time for granting her request .
`` Not at all , '' he said .
`` Please try to think a little more kindly of me , Cousin Margaret . ''
When the Old Lady reached the station she found , to her dismay , that her train had just gone and that she would have to wait two hours for the evening one .
She went into the waiting-room and sat down .
She was very tired .
All the excitement that had sustained her was gone , and she felt weak and old .
She had nothing to eat , having expected to get home in time for tea ; the waiting-room was chilly , and she shivered in her thin , old , silk mantilla .
Her head ached and her heart likewise .
She had won Sylvia 's desire for her ; but Sylvia would go out of her life , and the Old Lady did not see how she was to go on living after that .
Yet she sat there unflinchingly for two hours , an upright , indomitable old figure , silently fighting her losing battle with the forces of physical and mental pain , while happy people came and went , and laughed and talked before her .
At eight o'clock the Old Lady got off the train at Bright River station , and slipped off unnoticed into the darkness of the wet night .
She had two miles to walk , and a cold rain was falling .
Soon the Old Lady was wet to the skin and chilled to the marrow .
She felt as if she were walking in a bad dream .
Blind instinct alone guided her over the last mile and up the lane to her own house .
As she fumbled at her door , she realized that a burning heat had suddenly taken the place of her chilliness .
She stumbled in over her threshold and closed the door .
VI .
The October Chapter On the second morning after Old Lady Lloyd 's journey to town , Sylvia Gray was walking blithely down the wood lane .
It was a beautiful autumn morning , clear and crisp and sunny ; the frosted ferns , drenched and battered with the rain of yesterday , gave out a delicious fragrance ; here and there in the woods a maple waved a gay crimson banner , or a branch of birch showed pale golden against the dark , unchanging spruces .
The air was very pure and exhilarating .
Sylvia walked with a joyous lightness of step and uplift of brow .
At the beech in the hollow she paused for an expectant moment , but there was nothing among the gray old roots for her .
She was just turning away when little Teddy Kimball , who lived next door to the manse , came running down the slope from the direction of the old Lloyd place .
Teddy 's freckled face was very pale .
`` Oh , Miss Gray ! ''
he gasped .
`` I guess Old Lady Lloyd has gone clean crazy at last .
The minister 's wife asked me to run up to the Old Lady , with a message about the Sewing Circle -- and I knocked -- and knocked -- and nobody came -- so I thought I 'd just step in and leave the letter on the table .
But when I opened the door , I heard an awful queer laugh in the sitting-room , and next minute , the Old Lady came to the sitting-room door .
Oh , Miss Gray , she looked awful .
Her face was red and her eyes awful wild -- and she was muttering and talking to herself and laughing like mad .
I was so scared I just turned and run . ''
Sylvia , without stopping for reflection , caught Teddy 's hand and ran up the slope .
It did not occur to her to be frightened , although she thought with Teddy that the poor , lonely , eccentric Old Lady had really gone out of her mind at last .
The Old Lady was sitting on the kitchen sofa when Sylvia entered .
Teddy , too frightened to go in , lurked on the step outside .
The Old Lady still wore the damp black silk dress in which she had walked from the station .
Her face was flushed , her eyes wild , her voice hoarse .
But she knew Sylvia and cowered down .
`` Do n't look at me , '' she moaned .
`` Please go away -- I ca n't bear that YOU should know how poor I am .
You 're to go to Europe -- Andrew Cameron is going to send you -- I asked him -- he could n't refuse ME .
But please go away . ''
Sylvia did not go away .
At a glance she had seen that this was sickness and delirium , not insanity .
She sent Teddy off in hot haste for Mrs. Spencer and when Mrs. Spencer came they induced the Old Lady to go to bed , and sent for the doctor .
By night everybody in Spencervale knew that Old Lady Lloyd had pneumonia .
Mrs. Spencer announced that she meant to stay and nurse the Old Lady .
Several other women offered assistance .
Everybody was kind and thoughtful .
But the Old Lady did not know it .
She did not even know Sylvia Gray , who came and sat by her every minute she could spare .
Sylvia Gray now knew all that she had suspected -- the Old Lady was her fairy godmother .
The Old Lady babbled of Sylvia incessantly , revealing all her love for her , betraying all the sacrifices she had made .
Sylvia 's heart ached with love and tenderness , and she prayed earnestly that the Old Lady might recover .
`` I want her to know that I give her love for love , '' she murmured .
Everybody knew now how poor the Old Lady really was .
She let slip all the jealously guarded secrets of her existence , except her old love for Leslie Gray .
Even in delirium something sealed her lips as to that .
But all else came out -- her anguish over her unfashionable attire , her pitiful makeshifts and contrivances , her humiliation over wearing unfashionable dresses and paying only five cents where every other Sewing Circle member paid ten .
The kindly women who waited on her listened to her with tear-filled eyes , and repented of their harsh judgments in the past .
`` But who would have thought it ? ''
said Mrs. Spencer to the minister 's wife .
`` Nobody ever dreamed that her father had lost ALL his money , though folks supposed he had lost some in that old affair of the silver mine out west .
It 's shocking to think of the way she has lived all these years , often with not enough to eat -- and going to bed in winter days to save fuel .
Though I suppose if we had known we could n't have done much for her , she 's so desperate proud .
But if she lives , and will let us help her , things will be different after this .
Crooked Jack says he 'll never forgive himself for taking pay for the few little jobs he did for her .
He says , if she 'll only let him , he 'll do everything she wants done for her after this for nothing .
Ai n't it strange what a fancy she 's took to Miss Gray ?
Think of her doing all those things for her all summer , and selling the grape jug and all .
Well , the Old Lady certainly is n't mean , but nobody made a mistake in calling her queer .
It all does seem desperate pitiful .
Miss Gray 's taking it awful hard .
She seems to think about as much of the Old Lady as the Old Lady thinks of her .
She 's so worked up she do n't even seem to care about going to Europe next year .
She 's really going -- she 's had word from Andrew Cameron .
I 'm awful glad , for there never was a sweeter girl in the world ; but she says it will cost too much if the Old Lady 's life is to pay for it . ''
Andrew Cameron heard of the Old Lady 's illness and came out to Spencervale himself .
He was not allowed to see the Old Lady , of course ; but he told all concerned that no expense or trouble was to be spared , and the Spencervale doctor was instructed to send his bill to Andrew Cameron and hold his peace about it .
Moreover , when Andrew Cameron went back home , he sent a trained nurse out to wait on the Old Lady , a capable , kindly woman who contrived to take charge of the case without offending Mrs. Spencer -- than which no higher tribute could be paid to her tact !
The Old Lady did not die -- the Lloyd constitution brought her through .
One day , when Sylvia came in , the Old Lady smiled up at her , with a weak , faint , sensible smile , and murmured her name , and the nurse said that the crisis was past .
The Old Lady made a marvellously patient and tractable invalid .
She did just as she was told , and accepted the presence of the nurse as a matter of course .
But one day , when she was strong enough to talk a little , she said to Sylvia , `` I suppose Andrew Cameron sent Miss Hayes here , did he ? ''
`` Yes , '' said Sylvia , rather timidly .
The Old Lady noticed the timidity and smiled , with something of her old humour and spirit in her black eyes .
`` Time has been when I 'd have packed off unceremoniously any person Andrew Cameron sent here , '' she said .
`` But , Sylvia , I have gone through the Valley of the Shadow of Death , and I have left pride and resentment behind me for ever , I hope .
I no longer feel as I felt towards Andrew .
I can even accept a personal favour from him now .
At last I can forgive him for the wrong he did me and mine .
Sylvia , I find that I have been letting no ends of cats out of bags in my illness .
Everybody knows now how poor I am -- but I do n't seem to mind it a bit .
I 'm only sorry that I ever shut my neighbours out of my life because of my foolish pride .
Everyone has been so kind to me , Sylvia .
In the future , if my life is spared , it is going to be a very different sort of life .
I 'm going to open it to all the kindness and companionship I can find in young and old .
I 'm going to help them all I can and let them help me .
I CAN help people -- I 've learned that money is n't the only power for helping people .
Anyone who has sympathy and understanding to give has a treasure that is without money and without price .
And oh , Sylvia , you 've found out what I never meant you to know .
But I do n't mind that now , either . ''
Sylvia took the Old Lady 's thin white hand and kissed it .
`` I can never thank you enough for what you have done for me , dearest Miss Lloyd , '' she said earnestly .
`` And I am so glad that all mystery is done away with between us , and I can love you as much and as openly as I have longed to do .
I am so glad and so thankful that you love me , dear fairy godmother . ''
`` Do you know WHY I love you so ? ''
said the Old Lady wistfully .
`` Did I let THAT out in my raving , too ? ''
`` No , but I think I know .
It is because I am Leslie Gray 's daughter , is n't it ?
I know that father loved you -- his brother , Uncle Willis , told me all about it . ''
`` I spoiled my own life because of my wicked pride , '' said the Old Lady sadly .
`` But you will love me in spite of it all , wo n't you , Sylvia ?
And you will come to see me sometimes ?
And write me after you go away ? ''
`` I am coming to see you every day , '' said Sylvia .
`` I am going to stay in Spencervale for a whole year yet , just to be near you .
And next year when I go to Europe -- thanks to you , fairy godmother -- I 'll write you every day .
We are going to be the best of chums , and we are going to have a most beautiful year of comradeship ! ''
The Old Lady smiled contentedly .
Out in the kitchen , the minister 's wife , who had brought up a dish of jelly , was talking to Mrs. Spencer about the Sewing Circle .
Through the open window , where the red vines hung , came the pungent , sun-warm October air .
The sunshine fell over Sylvia 's chestnut hair like a crown of glory and youth .
`` I do feel so perfectly happy , '' said the Old Lady , with a long , rapturous breath .
III .
Each In His Own Tongue The honey-tinted autumn sunshine was falling thickly over the crimson and amber maples around old Abel Blair 's door .
There was only one outer door in old Abel 's house , and it almost always stood wide open .
A little black dog , with one ear missing and a lame forepaw , almost always slept on the worn red sandstone slab which served old Abel for a doorstep ; and on the still more worn sill above it a large gray cat almost always slept .
Just inside the door , on a bandy-legged chair of elder days , old Abel almost always sat .
He was sitting there this afternoon -- a little old man , sadly twisted with rheumatism ; his head was abnormally large , thatched with long , wiry black hair ; his face was heavily lined and swarthily sunburned ; his eyes were deep-set and black , with occasional peculiar golden flashes in them .
A strange looking man was old Abel Blair ; and as strange was he as he looked .
Lower Carmody people would have told you .
Old Abel was almost always sober in these , his later years .
He was sober to-day .
He liked to bask in that ripe sunlight as well as his dog and cat did ; and in such baskings he almost always looked out of his doorway at the far , fine blue sky over the tops of the crowding maples .
But to-day he was not looking at the sky , instead , he was staring at the black , dusty rafters of his kitchen , where hung dried meats and strings of onions and bunches of herbs and fishing tackle and guns and skins .
But old Abel saw not these things ; his face was the face of a man who beholds visions , compact of heavenly pleasure and hellish pain , for old Abel was seeing what he might have been -- and what he was ; as he always saw when Felix Moore played to him on the violin .
And the awful joy of dreaming that he was young again , with unspoiled life before him , was so great and compelling that it counterbalanced the agony in the realization of a dishonoured old age , following years in which he had squandered the wealth of his soul in ways where Wisdom lifted not her voice .
Felix Moore was standing opposite to him , before an untidy stove , where the noon fire had died down into pallid , scattered ashes .
Under his chin he held old Abel 's brown , battered fiddle ; his eyes , too , were fixed on the ceiling ; and he , too , saw things not lawful to be uttered in any language save that of music ; and of all music , only that given forth by the anguished , enraptured spirit of the violin .
And yet this Felix was little more than twelve years old , and his face was still the face of a child who knows nothing of either sorrow or sin or failure or remorse .
Only in his large , gray-black eyes was there something not of the child -- something that spoke of an inheritance from many hearts , now ashes , which had aforetime grieved and joyed , and struggled and failed , and succeeded and grovelled .
The inarticulate cries of their longings had passed into this child 's soul , and transmuted themselves into the expression of his music .
Felix was a beautiful child .
Carmody people , who stayed at home , thought so ; and old Abel Blair , who had roamed afar in many lands , thought so ; and even the Rev. Stephen Leonard , who taught , and tried to believe , that favour is deceitful and beauty is vain , thought so .
He was a slight lad , with sloping shoulders , a slim brown neck , and a head set on it with stag-like grace and uplift .
His hair , cut straight across his brow and falling over his ears , after some caprice of Janet Andrews , the minister 's housekeeper , was a glossy blue-black .
The skin of his face and hands was like ivory ; his eyes were large and beautifully tinted -- gray , with dilating pupils ; his features had the outlines of a cameo .
Carmody mothers considered him delicate , and had long foretold that the minister would never bring him up ; but old Abel pulled his grizzled moustache when he heard such forebodings and smiled .
`` Felix Moore will live , '' he said positively .
`` You ca n't kill that kind until their work is done .
He 's got a work to do -- if the minister 'll let him do it .
And if the minister do n't let him do it , then I would n't be in that minister 's shoes when he comes to the judgment -- no , I 'd rather be in my own .
It 's an awful thing to cross the purposes of the Almighty , either in your own life or anybody else 's .
Sometimes I think it 's what 's meant by the unpardonable sin -- ay , that I do ! ''
Carmody people never asked what old Abel meant .
They had long ago given up such vain questioning .
When a man had lived as old Abel had lived for the greater part of his life , was it any wonder he said crazy things ?
And as for hinting that Mr. Leonard , a man who was really almost too good to live , was guilty of any sin , much less an unpardonable one -- well , there now !
what use was it to be taking any account of old Abel 's queer speeches ?
Though , to be sure , there was no great harm in a fiddle , and maybe Mr. Leonard was a mite too strict that way with the child .
But then , could you wonder at it ?
There was his father , you see .
Felix finally lowered the violin , and came back to old Abel 's kitchen with a long sigh .
Old Abel smiled drearily at him -- the smile of a man who has been in the hands of the tormentors .
`` It 's awful the way you play -- it 's awful , '' he said with a shudder .
`` I never heard anything like it -- and you that never had any teaching since you were nine years old , and not much practice , except what you could get here now and then on my old , battered fiddle .
And to think you make it up yourself as you go along !
I suppose your grandfather would never hear to your studying music -- would he now ? ''
Felix shook his head .
`` I know he would n't , Abel .
He wants me to be a minister .
Ministers are good things to be , but I 'm afraid I ca n't be a minister . ''
`` Not a pulpit minister .
There 's different kinds of ministers , and each must talk to men in his own tongue if he 's going to do 'em any real good , '' said old Abel meditatively .
`` YOUR tongue is music .
Strange that your grandfather ca n't see that for himself , and him such a broad-minded man !
He 's the only minister I ever had much use for .
He 's God 's own if ever a man was .
And he loves you -- yes , sir , he loves you like the apple of his eye . ''
`` And I love him , '' said Felix warmly .
`` I love him so much that I 'll even try to be a minister for his sake , though I do n't want to be . ''
`` What do you want to be ? ''
`` A great violinist , '' answered the child , his ivory-hued face suddenly warming into living rose .
`` I want to play to thousands -- and see their eyes look as yours do when I play .
Sometimes your eyes frighten me , but oh , it 's a splendid fright !
If I had father 's violin I could do better .
I remember that he once said it had a soul that was doing purgatory for its sins when it had lived on earth .
I do n't know what he meant , but it did seem to me that HIS violin was alive .
He taught me to play on it as soon as I was big enough to hold it . ''
`` Did you love your father ? ''
asked old Abel , with a keen look .
Again Felix crimsoned ; but he looked straightly and steadily into his old friend 's face .
`` No , '' he said , `` I did n't ; but , '' he added , gravely and deliberately , `` I do n't think you should have asked me such a question . ''
It was old Abel 's turn to blush .
Carmody people would not have believed he could blush ; and perhaps no living being could have called that deepening hue into his weather-beaten cheek save only this gray-eyed child of the rebuking face .
`` No , I guess I should n't , '' he said .
`` But I 'm always making mistakes .
I 've never made anything else .
That 's why I 'm nothing more than ` Old Abel ' to the Carmody people .
Nobody but you and your grandfather ever calls me ` Mr. Blair . '
Yet William Blair at the store up there , rich and respected as he is , was n't half as clever a man as I was when we started in life : you may n't believe that , but it 's true .
And the worst of it is , young Felix , that most of the time I do n't care whether I 'm Mr. Blair of old Abel .
Only when you play I care .
It makes me feel just as a look I saw in a little girl 's eyes some years ago made me feel .
Her name was Anne Shirley and she lived with the Cuthberts down at Avonlea .
We got into a conversation at Blair 's store .
She could talk a blue streak to anyone , that girl could .
I happened to say about something that it did n't matter to a battered old hulk of sixty odd like me .
She looked at me with her big , innocent eyes , a little reproachful like , as if I 'd said something awful heretical .
` Do n't you think , Mr. Blair , ' she says , ` that the older we get the more things ought to matter to us ? '
-- as grave as if she 'd been a hundred instead of eleven .
` Things matter SO much to me now , ' she says , clasping her hands thisaway , ` and I 'm sure that when I 'm sixty they 'll matter just five times as much to me . '
Well , the way she looked and the way she spoke made me feel downright ashamed of myself because things had stopped mattering with me .
But never mind all that .
My miserable old feelings do n't count for much .
What come of your father 's fiddle ? ''
`` Grandfather took it away when I came here .
I think he burned it .
And I long for it so often . ''
`` Well , you 've always got my old brown fiddle to come to when you must . ''
`` Yes , I know .
And I 'm glad for that .
But I 'm hungry for a violin all the time .
And I only come here when the hunger gets too much to bear .
I feel as if I ought n't to come even then -- I 'm always saying I wo n't do it again , because I know grandfather would n't like it , if he knew . ''
`` He has never forbidden it , has he ? ''
`` No , but that is because he does n't know I come here for that .
He never thinks of such a thing .
I feel sure he WOULD forbid it , if he knew .
And that makes me very wretched .
And yet I HAVE to come .
Mr. Blair , do you know why grandfather ca n't bear to have me play on the violin ?
He loves music , and he does n't mind my playing on the organ , if I do n't neglect other things .
I ca n't understand it , can you ? ''
`` I have a pretty good idea , but I ca n't tell you .
It is n't my secret .
Maybe he 'll tell you himself some day .
But , mark you , young Felix , he has got good reasons for it all .
Knowing what I know , I ca n't blame him over much , though I think he 's mistaken .
Come now , play something more for me before you go -- something that 's bright and happy this time , so as to leave me with a good taste in my mouth .
That last thing you played took me straight to heaven , -- but heaven 's awful near to hell , and at the last you tipped me in . ''
`` I do n't understand you , '' said Felix , drawing his fine , narrow black brows together in a perplexed frown .
`` No -- and I would n't want you to .
You could n't understand unless you was an old man who had it in him once to do something and be a MAN , and just went and made himself a devilish fool .
But there must be something in you that understands things -- all kinds of things -- or you could n't put it all into music the way you do .
How do you do it ?
How in -- how DO you do it , young Felix ? ''
`` I do n't know .
But I play differently to different people .
I do n't know how that is .
When I 'm alone with you I have to play one way ; and when Janet comes over here to listen I feel quite another way -- not so thrilling , but happier and lonelier .
And that day when Jessie Blair was here listening I felt as if I wanted to laugh and sing -- as if the violin wanted to laugh and sing all the time . ''
The strange , golden gleam flashed through old Abel 's sunken eyes .
`` God , '' he muttered under his breath , `` I believe the boy can get into other folk 's souls somehow , and play out what HIS soul sees there . ''
`` What 's that you say ? ''
inquired Felix , petting his fiddle .
`` Nothing -- never mind -- go on .
Something lively now , young Felix .
Stop probing into my soul , where you have n't no business to be , you infant , and play me something out of your own -- something sweet and happy and pure . ''
`` I 'll play the way I feel on sunshiny mornings , when the birds are singing and I forget I have to be a minister , '' said Felix simply .
A witching , gurgling , mirthful strain , like mingled bird and brook song , floated out on the still air , along the path where the red and golden maple leaves were falling very softly , one by one .
The Reverend Stephen Leonard heard it , as he came along the way , and the Reverend Stephen Leonard smiled .
Now , when Stephen Leonard smiled , children ran to him , and grown people felt as if they looked from Pisgah over to some fair land of promise beyond the fret and worry of their care-dimmed earthly lives .
Mr. Leonard loved music , as he loved all things beautiful , whether in the material or the spiritual world , though he did not realize how much he loved them for their beauty alone , or he would have been shocked and remorseful .
He himself was beautiful .
His figure was erect and youthful , despite seventy years .
His face was as mobile and charming as a woman 's , yet with all a man 's tried strength and firmness in it , and his dark blue eyes flashed with the brilliance of one and twenty ; even his silken silvery hair could not make an old man of him .
He was worshipped by everyone who knew him , and he was , in so far as mortal man may be , worthy of that worship .
`` Old Abel is amusing himself with his violin again , '' he thought .
`` What a delicious thing he is playing !
He has quite a gift for the violin .
But how can he play such a thing as that , -- a battered old hulk of a man who has , at one time or another , wallowed in almost every sin to which human nature can sink ?
He was on one of his sprees three days ago -- the first one for over a year -- lying dead-drunk in the market square in Charlottetown among the dogs ; and now he is playing something that only a young archangel on the hills of heaven ought to be able to play .
Well , it will make my task all the easier .
Abel is always repentant by the time he is able to play on his fiddle . ''
Mr. Leonard was on the door-stone .
The little black dog had frisked down to meet him , and the gray cat rubbed her head against his leg .
Old Abel did not notice him ; he was beating time with uplifted hand and smiling face to Felix 's music , and his eyes were young again , glowing with laughter and sheer happiness .
`` Felix !
what does this mean ? ''
The violin bow clattered from Felix 's hand upon the floor ; he swung around and faced his grandfather .
As he met the passion of grief and hurt in the old man 's eyes , his own clouded with an agony of repentance .
`` Grandfather -- I 'm sorry , '' he cried brokenly .
`` Now , now ! ''
Old Abel had risen deprecatingly .
`` It 's all my fault , Mr. Leonard .
Do n't you blame the boy .
I coaxed him to play a bit for me .
I did n't feel fit to touch the fiddle yet myself -- too soon after Friday , you see .
So I coaxed him on -- would n't give him no peace till he played .
It 's all my fault . ''
`` No , '' said Felix , throwing back his head .
His face was as white as marble , yet it seemed ablaze with desperate truth and scorn of old Abel 's shielding lie .
`` No , grandfather , it is n't Abel 's fault .
I came over here on purpose to play , because I thought you had gone to the harbour .
I have come here often , ever since I have lived with you . ''
`` Ever since you have lived with me you have been deceiving me like this , Felix ? ''
There was no anger in Mr. Leonard 's tone -- only measureless sorrow .
The boy 's sensitive lips quivered .
`` Forgive me , grandfather , '' he whispered beseechingly .
`` You never forbid him to come , '' old Abel broke in angrily .
`` Be just , Mr. Leonard -- be just . ''
`` I AM just .
Felix knows that he has disobeyed me , in the spirit if not in the letter .
Do you not know it , Felix ? ''
`` Yes , grandfather , I have done wrong -- I 've known that I was doing wrong every time I came .
Forgive me , grandfather . ''
`` Felix , I forgive you , but I ask you to promise me , here and now , that you will never again , as long as you live , touch a violin . ''
Dusky crimson rushed madly over the boy 's face .
He gave a cry as if he had been lashed with a whip .
Old Abel sprang to his feet .
`` Do n't you ask such a promise of him , Mr. Leonard , '' he cried furiously .
`` It 's a sin , that 's what it is .
Man , man , what blinds you ?
You ARE blind .
Ca n't you see what is in the boy ?
His soul is full of music .
It 'll torture him to death -- or to worse -- if you do n't let it have way . ''
`` There is a devil in such music , '' said Mr. Leonard hotly .
`` Ay , there may be , but do n't forget that there 's a Christ in it , too , '' retorted old Abel in a low tense tone .
Mr. Leonard looked shocked ; he considered that old Abel had uttered blasphemy .
He turned away from him rebukingly .
`` Felix , promise me . ''
There was no relenting in his face or tone .
He was merciless in the use of the power he possessed over that young , loving spirit .
Felix understood that there was no escape ; but his lips were very white as he said , `` I promise , grandfather . ''
Mr. Leonard drew a long breath of relief .
He knew that promise would be kept .
So did old Abel .
The latter crossed the floor and sullenly took the violin from Felix 's relaxed hand .
Without a word or look he went into the little bedroom off the kitchen and shut the door with a slam of righteous indignation .
But from its window he stealthily watched his visitors go away .
Just as they entered on the maple path Mr. Leonard laid his hand on Felix 's head and looked down at him .
Instantly the boy flung his arm up over the old man 's shoulder and smiled at him .
In the look they exchanged there was boundless love and trust -- ay , and good-fellowship .
Old Abel 's scornful eyes again held the golden flash .
`` How those two love each other ! ''
he muttered enviously .
`` And how they torture each other ! ''
Mr. Leonard went to his study to pray when he got home .
He knew that Felix had run for comforting to Janet Andrews , the little , thin , sweet-faced , rigid-lipped woman who kept house for them .
Mr. Leonard knew that Janet would disapprove of his action as deeply as old Abel had done .
She would say nothing , she would only look at him with reproachful eyes over the teacups at suppertime .
But Mr. Leonard believed he had done what was best and his conscience did not trouble him , though his heart did .
Thirteen years before this , his daughter Margaret had almost broken that heart by marrying a man of whom he could not approve .
Martin Moore was a professional violinist .
He was a popular performer , though not in any sense a great one .
He met the slim , golden-haired daughter of the manse at the house of a college friend she was visiting in Toronto , and fell straightway in love with her .
Margaret had loved him with all her virginal heart in return , and married him , despite her father 's disapproval .
It was not to Martin Moore 's profession that Mr. Leonard objected , but to the man himself .
He knew that the violinist 's past life had not been such as became a suitor for Margaret Leonard ; and his insight into character warned him that Martin Moore could never make any woman lastingly happy .
Margaret Leonard did not believe this .
She married Martin Moore and lived one year in paradise .
Perhaps that atoned for the three bitter years which followed -- that , and her child .
At all events , she died as she had lived , loyal and uncomplaining .
She died alone , for her husband was away on a concert tour , and her illness was so brief that her father had not time to reach her before the end .
Her body was taken home to be buried beside her mother in the little Carmody churchyard .
Mr. Leonard wished to take the child , but Martin Moore refused to give him up .
Six years later Moore , too , died , and at last Mr. Leonard had his heart 's desire -- the possession of Margaret 's son .
The grandfather awaited the child 's coming with mingled feelings .
His heart yearned for him , yet he dreaded to meet a second edition of Martin Moore .
Suppose Margaret 's son resembled his handsome vagabond of a father !
Or , worse still , suppose he were cursed with his father 's lack of principle , his instability , his Bohemian instincts .
Thus Mr. Leonard tortured himself wretchedly before the coming of Felix .
The child did not look like either father or mother .
Instead , Mr. Leonard found himself looking into a face which he had put away under the grasses thirty years before -- the face of his girl bride , who had died at Margaret 's birth .
Here again were her lustrous gray-black eyes , her ivory outlines , her fine-traced arch of brow ; and here , looking out of those eyes , seemed her very spirit again .
From that moment the soul of the old man was knit to the soul of the child , and they loved each other with a love surpassing that of women .
Felix 's only inheritance from his father was his love of music .
But the child had genius , where his father had possessed only talent .
To Martin Moore 's outward mastery of the violin was added the mystery and intensity of his mother 's nature , with some more subtle quality still , which had perhaps come to him from the grandmother he so strongly resembled .
Moore had understood what a career was naturally before the child , and he had trained him in the technique of his art from the time the slight fingers could first grasp the bow .
When nine-year-old Felix came to the Carmody manse , he had mastered as much of the science of the violin as nine out of ten musicians acquire in a lifetime ; and he brought with him his father 's violin ; it was all Martin Moore had to leave his son -- but it was an Amati , the commercial value of which nobody in Carmody suspected .
Mr. Leonard had taken possession of it and Felix had never seen it since .
He cried himself to sleep many a night for the loss of it .
Mr. Leonard did not know this , and if Janet Andrews suspected it she held her tongue -- an art in which she excelled .
She `` saw no harm in a fiddle , '' herself , and thought Mr. Leonard absurdly strict in the matter , though it would not have been well for the luckless outsider who might have ventured to say as much to her .
She had connived at Felix 's visits to old Abel Blair , squaring the matter with her Presbyterian conscience by some peculiar process known only to herself .
When Janet heard of the promise which Mr. Leonard had exacted from Felix she seethed with indignation ; and , though she `` knew her place '' better than to say anything to Mr. Leonard about it , she made her disapproval so plainly manifest in her bearing that the stern , gentle old man found the atmosphere of his hitherto peaceful manse unpleasantly chill and hostile for a time .
It was the wish of his heart that Felix should be a minister , as he would have wished his own son to be , had one been born to him .
Mr. Leonard thought rightly that the highest work to which any man could be called was a life of service to his fellows ; but he made the mistake of supposing the field of service much narrower than it is -- of failing to see that a man may minister to the needs of humanity in many different but equally effective ways .
Janet hoped that Mr. Leonard might not exact the fulfilment of Felix 's promise ; but Felix himself , with the instinctive understanding of perfect love , knew that it was vain to hope for any change of viewpoint in his grandfather .
He addressed himself to the keeping of his promise in letter and in spirit .
He never went again to old Abel 's ; he did not even play on the organ , though this was not forbidden , because any music wakened in him a passion of longing and ecstasy which demanded expression with an intensity not to be borne .
He flung himself grimly into his studies and conned Latin and Greek verbs with a persistency which soon placed him at the head of all competitors .
Only once in the long winter did he come near to breaking his promise .
One evening , when March was melting into April , and the pulses of spring were stirring under the lingering snow , he was walking home from school alone .
As he descended into the little hollow below the manse a lively lilt of music drifted up to meet him .
It was only the product of a mouth-organ , manipulated by a little black-eyed , French-Canadian hired boy , sitting on the fence by the brook ; but there was music in the ragged urchin and it came out through his simple toy .
It tingled over Felix from head to foot ; and , when Leon held out the mouth-organ with a fraternal grin of invitation , he snatched at it as a famished creature might snatch at food .
Then , with it half-way to his lips , he paused .
True , it was only the violin he had promised never to touch ; but he felt that if he gave way ever so little to the desire that was in him , it would sweep everything before it .
If he played on Leon Buote 's mouth-organ , there in that misty spring dale , he would go to old Abel 's that evening ; he KNEW he would go .
To Leon 's amazement , Felix threw the mouth-organ back at him and ran up the hill as if he were pursued .
There was something in his boyish face that frightened Leon ; and it frightened Janet Andrews as Felix rushed past her in the hall of the manse .
`` Child , what 's the matter with you ? ''
she cried .
`` Are you sick ?
Have you been scared ? ''
`` No , no .
Leave me alone , Janet , '' said Felix chokingly , dashing up the stairs to his own room .
He was quite composed when he came down to tea , an hour later , though he was unusually pale and had purple shadows under his large eyes .
Mr. Leonard scrutinized him somewhat anxiously ; it suddenly occurred to the old minister that Felix was looking more delicate than his wont this spring .
Well , he had studied hard all winter , and he was certainly growing very fast .
When vacation came he must be sent away for a visit .
`` They tell me Naomi Clark is real sick , '' said Janet .
`` She has been ailing all winter , and now she 's fast to her bed .
Mrs. Murphy says she believes the woman is dying , but nobody dares tell her so .
She wo n't give in she 's sick , nor take medicine .
And there 's nobody to wait on her except that simple creature , Maggie Peterson . ''
`` I wonder if I ought to go and see her , '' said Mr. Leonard uneasily .
`` What use would it be to bother yourself ?
You know she would n't see you -- she 'd shut the door in your face like she did before .
She 's an awful wicked woman -- but it 's kind of terrible to think of her lying there sick , with no responsible person to tend her . ''
`` Naomi Clark is a bad woman and she lived a life of shame , but I like her , for all that , '' remarked Felix , in the grave , meditative tone in which he occasionally said rather startling things .
Mr. Leonard looked somewhat reproachfully at Janet Andrews , as if to ask her why Felix should have attained to this dubious knowledge of good and evil under her care ; and Janet shot a dour look back which , being interpreted , meant that if Felix went to the district school she could not and would not be held responsible if he learned more there than arithmetic and Latin .
`` What do you know of Naomi Clark to like or dislike ? ''
she asked curiously .
`` Did you ever see her ? ''
`` Oh , yes , '' Felix replied , addressing himself to his cherry preserve with considerable gusto .
`` I was down at Spruce Cove one night last summer when a big thunderstorm came up .
I went to Naomi 's house for shelter .
The door was open , so I walked right in , because nobody answered my knock .
Naomi Clark was at the window , watching the cloud coming up over the sea .
She just looked at me once , but did n't say anything , and then went on watching the cloud .
I did n't like to sit down because she had n't asked me to , so I went to the window by her and watched it , too .
It was a dreadful sight -- the cloud was so black and the water so green , and there was such a strange light between the cloud and the water ; yet there was something splendid in it , too .
Part of the time I watched the storm , and the other part I watched Naomi 's face .
It was dreadful to see , like the storm , and yet I liked to see it .
`` After the thunder was over it rained a while longer , and Naomi sat down and talked to me .
She asked me who I was , and when I told her she asked me to play something for her on her violin , '' -- Felix shot a deprecating glance at Mr. Leonard -- `` because , she said , she 'd heard I was a great hand at it .
She wanted something lively , and I tried just as hard as I could to play something like that .
But I could n't .
I played something that was terrible -- it just played itself -- it seemed as if something was lost that could never be found again .
And before I got through , Naomi came at me , and tore the violin from me , and -- SWORE .
And she said , ` You big-eyed brat , how did you know THAT ? '
Then she took me by the arm -- and she hurt me , too , I can tell you -- and she put me right out in the rain and slammed the door . ''
`` The rude , unmannerly creature ! ''
said Janet indignantly .
`` Oh , no , she was quite in the right , '' said Felix composedly .
`` It served me right for what I played .
You see , she did n't know I could n't help playing it .
I suppose she thought I did it on purpose . ''
`` What on earth did you play , child ? ''
`` I do n't know . ''
Felix shivered .
`` It was awful -- it was dreadful .
It was fit to break you heart .
But it HAD to be played , if I played anything at all . ''
`` I do n't understand what you mean -- I declare I do n't , '' said Janet in bewilderment .
`` I think we 'll change the subject of conversation , '' said Mr. Leonard .
It was a month later when `` the simple creature , Maggie '' appeared at the manse door one evening and asked for the preached .
`` Naomi wants ter see yer , '' she mumbled .
`` Naomi sent Maggie ter tell yer ter come at onct . ''
`` I shall go , certainly , '' said Mr. Leonard gently .
`` Is she very ill ? ''
`` Her 's dying , '' said Maggie with a broad grin .
`` And her 's awful skeered of hell .
Her just knew ter-day her was dying .
Maggie told her -- her would n't believe the harbour women , but her believed Maggie .
Her yelled awful . ''
Maggie chuckled to herself over the gruesome remembrance .
Mr. Leonard , his heart filled with pity , called Janet and told her to give the poor creature some refreshment .
But Maggie shook her head .
`` No , no , preacher , Maggie must get right back to Naomi .
Maggie 'll tell her the preacher 's coming ter save her from hell . ''
She uttered an eerie cry , and ran at full speed shoreward through the spruce woods .
`` The Lord save us ! ''
said Janet in an awed tone .
`` I knew the poor girl was simple , but I did n't know she was like THAT .
And are you going , sir ? ''
`` Yes , of course .
I pray God I may be able to help the poor soul , '' said Mr. Leonard sincerely .
He was a man who never shirked what he believed to be his duty ; but duty had sometimes presented itself to him in pleasanter guise than this summons to Naomi Clark 's death-bed .
The woman had been the plague spot of Lower Carmody and Carmody Harbour for a generation .
In the earlier days of his ministry to the congregation he had tried to reclaim her , and Naomi had mocked and flouted him to his face .
Then , for the sake of those to whom she was a snare or a heart-break , he had endeavoured to set the law in motion against her , and Naomi had laughed the law to scorn .
Finally , he had been compelled to let her alone .
Yet Naomi had not always been an outcast .
Her girlhood had been innocent ; but she was the possessor of a dangerous beauty , and her mother was dead .
Her father was a man notorious for his harshness and violence of temper .
When Naomi made the fatal mistake of trusting to a false love that betrayed and deserted , he drove her from his door with taunts and curses .
Naomi took up her quarters in a little deserted house at Spruce Cove .
Had her child lived it might have saved her .
But it died at birth , and with its little life went her last chance of worldly redemption .
From that time forth , her feet were set in the way that takes hold on hell .
For the past five years , however , Naomi had lived a tolerably respectable life .
When Janet Peterson had died , her idiot daughter , Maggie , had been left with no kin in the world .
Nobody knew what was to be done with her , for nobody wanted to be bothered with her .
Naomi Clark went to the girl and offered her a home .
People said she was no fit person to have charge of Maggie , but everybody shirked the unpleasant task of interfering in the matter , except Mr. Leonard , who went to expostulate with Naomi , and , as Janet said , for his pains got her door shut in his face .
But from the day when Maggie Peterson went to live with her , Naomi ceased to be the harbour Magdalen .
The sun had set when Mr. Leonard reached Spruce Cove , and the harbour was veiling itself in a wondrous twilight splendour .
Afar out , the sea lay throbbing and purple , and the moan of the bar came through the sweet , chill spring air with its burden of hopeless , endless longing and seeking .
The sky was blossoming into stars above the afterglow ; out to the east the moon was rising , and the sea beneath it was a thing of radiance and silver and glamour ; and a little harbour boat that went sailing across it was transmuted into an elfin shallop from the coast of fairyland .
Mr. Leonard sighed as he turned from the sinless beauty of the sea and sky to the threshold of Naomi Clark 's house .
It was very small -- one room below , and a sleeping-loft above ; but a bed had been made up for the sick woman by the down-stairs window looking out on the harbour ; and Naomi lay on it , with a lamp burning at her head and another at her side , although it was not yet dark .
A great dread of darkness had always been one of Naomi 's peculiarities .
She was tossing restlessly on her poor couch , while Maggie crouched on a box at the foot .
Mr. Leonard had not seen her for five years , and he was shocked at the change in her .
She was much wasted ; her clear-cut , aquiline features had been of the type which becomes indescribably witch-like in old age , and , though Naomi Clark was barely sixty , she looked as if she might be a hundred .
Her hair streamed over the pillow in white , uncared-for tresses , and the hands that plucked at the bed-clothes were like wrinkled claws .
Only her eyes were unchanged ; they were as blue and brilliant as ever , but now filled with such agonized terror and appeal that Mr. Leonard 's gentle heart almost stood still with the horror of them .
They were the eyes of a creature driven wild with torture , hounded by furies , clutched by unutterable fear .
Naomi sat up and dragged at his arm .
`` Can you help me ?
Can you help me ? ''
she gasped imploringly .
`` Oh , I thought you 'd never come !
I was skeered I 'd die before you got here -- die and go to hell .
I did n't know before today that I was dying .
None of those cowards would tell me .
Can you help me ? ''
`` If I can not , God can , '' said Mr. Leonard gently .
He felt himself very helpless and inefficient before this awful terror and frenzy .
He had seen sad death-beds -- troubled death-beds -- ay , and despairing death-beds , but never anything like this .
`` God ! ''
Naomi 's voice shrilled terribly as she uttered the name .
`` I ca n't go to God for help .
Oh , I 'm skeered of hell , but I 'm skeereder still of God .
I 'd rather go to hell a thousand times over than face God after the life I 've lived .
I tell you , I 'm sorry for living wicked -- I was always sorry for it all the time .
There ai n't never been a moment I was n't sorry , though nobody would believe it .
I was driven on by fiends of hell .
Oh , you do n't understand -- you CA N'T understand -- but I was always sorry ! ''
`` If you repent , that is all that is necessary .
God will forgive you if you ask Him . ''
`` No , He ca n't !
Sins like mine ca n't be forgiven .
He ca n't -- and He wo n't . ''
`` He can and He will .
He is a God of love , Naomi . ''
`` No , '' said Naomi with stubborn conviction .
`` He is n't a God of love at all .
That 's why I 'm skeered of him .
No , no .
He 's a God of wrath and justice and punishment .
Love !
There ai n't no such thing as love !
I 've never found it on earth , and I do n't believe it 's to be found in God . ''
`` Naomi , God loves us like a father . ''
`` Like MY father ? ''
Naomi 's shrill laughter , pealing through the still room , was hideous to hear .
The old minister shuddered .
`` No -- no !
As a kind , tender , all-wise father , Naomi -- as you would have loved your little child if it had lived . ''
Naomi cowered and moaned .
`` Oh , I wish I could believe THAT .
I would n't be frightened if I could believe that .
MAKE me believe it .
Surely you can make me believe that there 's love and forgiveness in God if you believe it yourself . ''
`` Jesus Christ forgave and loved the Magdalen , Naomi . ''
`` Jesus Christ ?
Oh , I ai n't afraid of HIM .
Yes , HE could understand and forgive .
He was half human .
I tell you , it 's God I 'm skeered of . ''
`` They are one and the same , '' said Mr. Leonard helplessly .
He knew he could not make Naomi realize it .
This anguished death-bed was no place for a theological exposition on the mysteries of the Trinity .
`` Christ died for you , Naomi .
He bore your sins in His own body on the cross . ''
`` We bear our own sins , '' said Naomi fiercely .
`` I 've borne mine all my life -- and I 'll bear them for all eternity .
I ca n't believe anything else .
I CA N'T believe God can forgive me .
I 've ruined people body and soul -- I 've broken hearts and poisoned homes -- I 'm worse than a murderess .
No -- no -- no , there 's no hope for me . ''
Her voice rose again into that shrill , intolerable shriek .
`` I 've got to go to hell .
It ai n't so much the fire I 'm skeered of as the outer darkness .
I 've always been so skeered of darkness -- it 's so full of awful things and thoughts .
Oh , there ai n't nobody to help me !
Man ai n't no good and I 'm too skeered of God . ''
She wrung her hands .
Mr. Leonard walked up and down the room in the keenest anguish of spirit he had ever known .
What could he do ?
What could he say ?
There was healing and peace in his religion for this woman as for all others , but he could express it in no language which this tortured soul could understand .
He looked at her writhing face ; he looked at the idiot girl chuckling to herself at the foot of the bed ; he looked through the open door to the remote , starlit night -- and a horrible sense of utter helplessness overcame him .
He could do nothing -- nothing !
In all his life he had never known such bitterness of soul as the realization brought home to him .
`` What is the good of you if you ca n't help me ? ''
moaned the dying woman .
`` Pray -- pray -- pray ! ''
she shrilled suddenly .
Mr. Leonard dropped on his knees by the bed .
He did not know what to say .
No prayer that he had ever prayed was of use here .
The old , beautiful formulas , which had soothed and helped the passing of many a soul , were naught save idle , empty words to Naomi Clark .
In his anguish of mind Stephen Leonard gasped out the briefest and sincerest prayer his lips had ever uttered .
`` O , God , our Father !
Help this woman .
Speak to her in a tongue which she can understand . ''
A beautiful , white face appeared for a moment in the light that streamed out of the doorway into the darkness of the night .
No one noticed it , and it quickly drew back into the shadow .
Suddenly , Naomi fell back on her pillow , her lips blue , her face horribly pinched , her eyes rolled up in her head .
Maggie started up , pushed Mr. Leonard aside , and proceeded to administer some remedy with surprising skill and deftness .
Mr. Leonard , believing Naomi to be dying , went to the door , feeling sick and bruised in soul .
Presently a figure stole out into the light .
`` Felix , is that you ? ''
said Mr. Leonard in a startled tone .
`` Yes , sir . ''
Felix came up to the stone step .
`` Janet got frightened what you might fall on that rough road after dark , so she made me come after you with a lantern .
I 've been waiting behind the point , but at last I thought I 'd better come and see if you would be staying much longer .
If you will be , I 'll go back to Janet and leave the lantern here with you . ''
`` Yes , that will be the best thing to do .
I may not be ready to go home for some time yet , '' said Mr. Leonard , thinking that the death-bed of sin behind him was no sight for Felix 's young eyes .
`` Is that your grandson you 're talking to ? ''
Naomi spoke clearly and strongly .
The spasm had passed .
`` If it is , bring him in .
I want to see him . ''
Reluctantly , Mr. Leonard signed Felix to enter .
The boy stood by Naomi 's bed and looked down at her with sympathetic eyes .
But at first she did not look at him -- she looked past him at the minister .
`` I might have died in that spell , '' she said , with sullen reproach in her voice , `` and if I had , I 'd been in hell now .
You ca n't help me -- I 'm done with you .
There ai n't any hope for me , and I know it now . ''
She turned to Felix .
`` Take down that fiddle on the wall and play something for me , '' she said imperiously .
`` I 'm dying -- and I 'm going to hell -- and I do n't want to think of it .
Play me something to take my thoughts off it -- I do n't care what you play .
I was always fond of music -- there was always something in it for me I never found anywhere else . ''
Felix looked at his grandfather .
The old man nodded , he felt too ashamed to speak ; he sat with his fine silver head in his hands , while Felix took down and tuned the old violin , on which so many godless lilts had been played in many a wild revel .
Mr. Leonard felt that he had failed his religion .
He could not give Naomi the help that was in it for her .
Felix drew the bow softly , perplexedly over the strings .
He had no idea what he should play .
Then his eyes were caught and held by Naomi 's burning , mesmeric , blue gaze as she lay on her crumpled pillow .
A strange , inspired look came over the boy 's face .
He began to play as if it were not he who played , but some mightier power , of which he was but the passive instrument .
Sweet and soft and wonderful was the music that stole through the room .
Mr. Leonard forgot his heartbreak and listened to it in puzzled amazement .
He had never heard anything like it before .
How could the child play like that ?
He looked at Naomi and marvelled at the change in her face .
The fear and frenzy were going out of it ; she listened breathlessly , never taking her eyes from Felix .
At the foot of the bed the idiot girl sat with tears on her cheeks .
In that strange music was the joy of the innocent , mirthful childhood , blent with the laughter of waves and the call of glad winds .
Then it held the wild , wayward dreams of youth , sweet and pure in all their wildness and waywardness .
They were followed by a rapture of young love -- all-surrendering , all-sacrificing love .
The music changed .
It held the torture of unshed tears , the anguish of a heart deceived and desolate .
Mr. Leonard almost put his hands over his ears to shut out its intolerable poignancy .
But on the dying woman 's face was only a strange relief , as if some dumb , long-hidden pain had at last won to the healing of utterance .
The sullen indifference of despair came next , the bitterness of smouldering revolt and misery , the reckless casting away of all good .
There was something indescribably evil in the music now -- so evil that Mr. Leonard 's white soul shuddered away in loathing , and Maggie cowered and whined like a frightened animal .
Again the music changed .
And in it now there was agony and fear -- and repentance and a cry for pardon .
To Mr. Leonard there was something strangely familiar in it .
He struggled to recall where he had heard it before ; then he suddenly knew -- he had heard it before Felix came in Naomi 's terrible words !
He looked at his grandson with something like awe .
Here was a power of which he knew nothing -- a strange and dreadful power .
Was it of God ?
Or of Satan ?
For the last time the music changed .
And now it was not music at all -- it was a great , infinite forgiveness , an all-comprehending love .
It was healing for a sick soul ; it was light and hope and peace .
A Bible text , seemingly incongruous , came into Mr. Leonard 's mind -- `` This is the house of God ; this is the gate of heaven . ''
Felix lowered the violin and dropped wearily on a chair by the bed .
The inspired light faded from his face ; once more he was only a tired boy .
But Stephen Leonard was on his knees , sobbing like a child ; and Naomi Clark was lying still , with her hands clasped over her breast .
`` I understand now , '' she said very softly .
`` I could n't see it before -- and now it 's so plain .
I just FEEL it .
God IS a God of love .
He can forgive anybody -- even me -- even me .
He knows all about it .
I ai n't skeered any more .
He just loves me and forgives me as I 'd have loved and forgiven my baby if she 'd lived , no matter how bad she was , or what she did .
The minister told me that but I could n't believe it .
I KNOW it now .
And He sent you here to-night , boy , to tell it to me in a way that I could feel it . ''
Naomi Clark died just as the dawn came up over the sea .
Mr. Leonard rose from his watch at her bedside and went to the door .
Before him spread the harbour , gray and austere in the faint light , but afar out the sun was rending asunder the milk-white mists in which the sea was scarfed , and under it was a virgin glow of sparkling water .
The fir trees on the point moved softly and whispered together .
The whole world sang of spring and resurrection and life ; and behind him Naomi Clark 's dead face took on the peace that passes understanding .
The old minister and his grandson walked home together in a silence that neither wished to break .
Janet Andrews gave them a good scolding and an excellent breakfast .
Then she ordered them both to bed ; but Mr. Leonard , smiling at her , said : `` Presently , Janet , presently .
But now , take this key , go up to the black chest in the garret , and bring me what you will find there . ''
When Janet had gone , he turned to Felix .
`` Felix , would you like to study music as your life-work ? ''
Felix looked up , with a transfiguring flush on his wan face .
`` Oh , grandfather !
Oh , grandfather ! ''
`` You may do so , my child .
After this night I dare not hinder you .
Go with my blessing , and may God guide and keep you , and make you strong to do His work and tell His message to humanity in you own appointed way .
It is not the way I desired for you -- but I see that I was mistaken .
Old Abel spoke truly when he said there was a Christ in your violin as well as a devil .
I understand what he meant now . ''
He turned to meet Janet , who came into the study with a violin .
Felix 's heart throbbed ; he recognized it .
Mr. Leonard took it from Janet and held it out to the boy .
`` This is your father 's violin , Felix .
See to it that you never make your music the servant of the power of evil -- never debase it to unworthy ends .
For your responsibility is as your gift , and God will exact the accounting of it from you .
Speak to the world in your own tongue through it , with truth and sincerity ; and all I have hoped for you will be abundantly fulfilled . ''
IV .
Little Joscelyn `` It simply is n't to be thought of , Aunty Nan , '' said Mrs. William Morrison decisively .
Mrs. William Morrison was one of those people who always speak decisively .
If they merely announce that they are going to peel the potatoes for dinner their hearers realize that there is no possible escape for the potatoes .
Moreover , these people are always given their full title by everybody .
William Morrison was called Billy oftener than not ; but , if you had asked for Mrs. Billy Morrison , nobody in Avonlea would have known what you meant at first guess .
`` You must see that for yourself , Aunty , '' went on Mrs. William , hulling strawberries nimbly with her large , firm , white fingers as she talked .
Mrs. William always improved every shining moment .
`` It is ten miles to Kensington , and just think how late you would be getting back .
You are not able for such a drive .
You would n't get over it for a month .
You know you are anything but strong this summer . ''
Aunty Nan sighed , and patted the tiny , furry , gray morsel of a kitten in her lap with trembling fingers .
She knew , better than anyone else could know it , that she was not strong that summer .
In her secret soul , Aunty Nan , sweet and frail and timid under the burden of her seventy years , felt with mysterious unmistakable prescience that it was to be her last summer at the Gull Point Farm .
But that was only the more reason why she should go to hear little Joscelyn sing ; she would never have another chance .
And oh , to hear little Joscelyn sing just once -- Joscelyn , whose voice was delighting thousands out in the big world , just as in the years gone by it had delighted Aunty Nan and the dwellers at the Gull Point Farm for a whole golden summer with carols at dawn and dusk about the old place !
`` Oh , I know I 'm not very strong , Maria . ''
said Aunty Nan pleadingly , `` but I am strong enough for that .
Indeed I am .
I could stay at Kensington over night with George 's folks , you know , and so it would n't tire me much .
I do so want to hear Joscelyn sing .
Oh , how I love little Joscelyn . ''
`` It passes my understanding , the way you hanker after that child , '' cried Mrs. William impatiently .
`` Why , she was a perfect stranger to you when she came here , and she was here only one summer ! ''
`` But oh , such a summer ! ''
said Aunty Nan softly .
`` We all loved little Joscelyn .
She just seemed like one of our own .
She was one of God 's children , carrying love with them everywhere .
In some ways that little Anne Shirley the Cuthberts have got up there at Green Gables reminds me of her , though in other ways they 're not a bit alike .
Joscelyn was a beauty . ''
`` Well , that Shirley snippet certainly is n't that , '' said Mrs. William sarcastically .
`` And if Joscelyn 's tongue was one third as long as Anne Shirley 's the wonder to me is that she did n't talk you all to death out of hand . ''
`` Little Joscelyn was n't much of a talker , '' said Aunty Nan dreamily .
`` She was kind of a quiet child .
But you remember what she did say .
And I 've never forgotten little Joscelyn . ''
Mrs. William shrugged her plump , shapely shoulders .
`` Well , it was fifteen years ago , Aunty Nan , and Joscelyn ca n't be very ` little ' now .
She is a famous woman , and she has forgotten all about you , you can be sure of that . ''
`` Joscelyn was n't the kind that forgets , '' said Aunty Nan loyally .
`` And , anyway , the point is , I have n't forgotten HER .
Oh , Maria , I 've longed for years and years just to hear her sing once more .
It seems as if I MUST hear my little Joscelyn sing once again before I die .
I 've never had the chance before and I never will have it again .
Do please ask William to take me to Kensington . ''
`` Dear me , Aunty Nan , this is really childish , '' said Mrs. William , whisking her bowlful of berries into the pantry .
`` You must let other folks be the judge of what is best for you now .
You are n't strong enough to drive to Kensington , and , even if you were , you know well enough that William could n't go to Kensington to-morrow night .
He has got to attend that political meeting at Newbridge .
They ca n't do without him . ''
`` Jordan could take me to Kensington , '' pleaded Aunty Nan , with very unusual persistence .
`` Nonsense !
You could n't go to Kensington with the hired man .
Now , Aunty Nan , do be reasonable .
Are n't William and I kind to you ?
Do n't we do everything for your comfort ? ''
`` Yes , oh , yes , '' admitted Aunty Nan deprecatingly .
`` Well , then , you ought to be guided by our opinion .
And you must just give up thinking about the Kensington concert , Aunty , and not worry yourself and me about it any more .
I am going down to the shore field now to call William to tea .
Just keep an eye on the baby in chance he wakes up , and see that the teapot does n't boil over . ''
Mrs. William whisked out of the kitchen , pretending not to see the tears that were falling over Aunty Nan 's withered pink cheeks .
Aunty Nan was really getting very childish , Mrs. William reflected , as she marched down to the shore field .
Why , she cried now about every little thing !
And such a notion -- to want to go to the Old Timers ' concert at Kensington and be so set on it !
Really , it was hard to put up with her whims .
Mrs. William sighed virtuously .
As for Aunty Nan , she sat alone in the kitchen , and cried bitterly , as only lonely old age can cry .
It seemed to her that she could not bear it , that she MUST go to Kensington .
But she knew that it was not to be , since Mrs. William had decided otherwise .
Mrs. William 's word was law at Gull Point Farm .
`` What 's the matter with my old Aunty Nan ? ''
cried a hearty young voice from the doorway .
Jordan Sloane stood there , his round , freckled face looking as anxious and sympathetic as it was possible for such a very round , very freckled face to look .
Jordan was the Morrisons ' hired boy that summer , and he worshipped Aunty Nan .
`` Oh , Jordan , '' sobbed Aunty Nan , who was not above telling her troubles to the hired help , although Mrs. William thought she ought to be , `` I ca n't go to Kensington to-morrow night to hear little Joscelyn sing at the Old Timers ' concert .
Maria says I ca n't . ''
`` That 's too bad , '' said Jordan .
`` Old cat , '' he muttered after the retreating and serenely unconscious Mrs. William .
Then he shambled in and sat down on the sofa beside Aunty Nan .
`` There , there , do n't cry , '' he said , patting her thin little shoulder with his big , sunburned paw .
`` You 'll make yourself sick if you go on crying , and we ca n't get along without you at Gull Point Farm . ''
Aunty Nan smiled wanly .
`` I 'm afraid you 'll soon have to get on without me , Jordan .
I 'm not going to be here very long now .
No , I 'm not , Jordan , I know it .
Something tells me so very plainly .
But I would be willing to go -- glad to go , for I 'm very tired , Jordan -- if I could only have heard little Joscelyn sing once more . ''
`` Why are you so set on hearing her ? ''
asked Jordan .
`` She ai n't no kin to you , is she ? ''
`` No , but dearer to me -- dearer to me than many of my own .
Maria thinks that is silly , but you would n't if you 'd known her , Jordan .
Even Maria herself would n't , if she had known her .
It is fifteen years since she came here one summer to board .
She was a child of thirteen then , and had n't any relations except an old uncle who sent her to school in winter and boarded her out in summer , and did n't care a rap about her .
The child was just starving for love , Jordan , and she got it here .
William and his brothers were just children then , and they had n't any sister .
We all just worshipped her .
She was so sweet , Jordan .
And pretty , oh my !
like a little girl in a picture , with great long curls , all black and purply and fine as spun silk , and big dark eyes , and such pink cheeks -- real wild rose cheeks .
And sing !
My land !
But could n't she sing !
Always singing , every hour of the day that voice was ringing round the old place .
I used to hold my breath to hear it .
She always said that she meant to be a famous singer some day , and I never doubted it a mite .
It was born in her .
Sunday evening she used to sing hymns for us .
Oh , Jordan , it makes my old heart young again to remember it .
A sweet child she was , my little Joscelyn !
She used to write me for three or four years after she went away , but I have n't heard a word from her for long and long .
I daresay she has forgotten me , as Maria says .
` Twould n't be any wonder .
But I have n't forgotten her , and oh , I want to see and hear her terrible much .
She is to sing at the Old Timers ' concert to-morrow night at Kensington .
The folks who are getting the concert up are friends of hers , or , of course , she 'd never have come to a little country village .
Only sixteen miles away -- and I ca n't go . ''
Jordan could n't think of anything to say .
He reflected savagely that if he had a horse of his own he would take Aunty Nan to Kensington , Mrs. William or no Mrs. William .
Though , to be sure , it WAS a long drive for her ; and she was looking very frail this summer .
`` Ai n't going to last long , '' muttered Jordan , making his escape by the porch door as Mrs. William puffed in by the other .
`` The sweetest old creetur that ever was created 'll go when she goes .
Yah , ye old madam , I 'd like to give you a piece of my mind , that I would ! ''
This last was for Mrs. William , but was delivered in a prudent undertone .
Jordan detested Mrs. William , but she was a power to be reckoned with , all the same .
Meek , easy-going Billy Morrison did just what his wife told him to .
So Aunty Nan did not get to Kensington to hear little Joscelyn sing .
She said nothing more about it but after that night she seemed to fail very rapidly .
Mrs. William said it was the hot weather , and that Aunty Nan gave way too easily .
But Aunty Nan could not help giving way now ; she was very , very tired .
Even her knitting wearied her .
She would sit for hours in her rocking chair with the gray kitten in her lap , looking out of the window with dreamy , unseeing eyes .
She talked to herself a good deal , generally about little Joscelyn .
Mrs. William told Avonlea folk that Aunty Nan had got terribly childish and always accompanied the remark with a sigh that intimated how much she , Mrs. William , had to contend with .
Justice must be done to Mrs. William , however .
She was not unkind to Aunty Nan ; on the contrary , she was very kind to her in the letter .
Her comfort was scrupulously attended to , and Mrs. William had the grace to utter none of her complaints in the old woman 's hearing .
If Aunty Nan felt the absence of the spirit she never murmured at it .
One day , when the Avonlea slopes were golden-hued with the ripened harvest , Aunty Nan did not get up .
She complained of nothing but great weariness .
Mrs. William remarked to her husband that if SHE lay in bed every day she felt tired , there would n't be much done at Gull Point Farm .
But she prepared an excellent breakfast and carried it patiently up to Aunty Nan , who ate little of it .
After dinner Jordan crept up by way of the back stairs to see her .
Aunty Nan was lying with her eyes fixed on the pale pink climbing roses that nodded about the window .
When she saw Jordan she smiled .
`` Them roses put me so much in mind of little Joscelyn , '' she said softly .
`` She loved them so .
If I could only see her !
Oh , Jordan , if I could only see her !
Maria says it 's terrible childish to be always harping on that string , and mebbe it is .
But -- oh , Jordan , there 's such a hunger in my heart for her , such a hunger ! ''
Jordan felt a queer sensation in his throat , and twisted his ragged straw hat about in his big hands .
Just then a vague idea which had hovered in his brain all day crystallized into decision .
But all he said was : `` I hope you 'll feel better soon , Aunty Nan . ''
`` Oh , yes , Jordan dear , I 'll be better soon , '' said Aunty Nan with her own sweet smile . ''
` The inhabitant shall not say I am sick , ' you know .
But if I could only see little Joscelyn first ! ''
Jordan went out and hurried down-stairs .
Billy Morrison was in the stable , when Jordan stuck his head over the half-door .
`` Say , can I have the rest of the day off , sir ?
I want to go to Kensington . ''
`` Well , I do n't mind , '' said Billy Morrison amiably .
`` May 's well get you jaunting done ` fore harvest comes on .
And here , Jord ; take this quarter and get some oranges for Aunty Nan .
Need n't mention it to headquarters . ''
Billy Morrison 's face was solemn , but Jordan winked as he pocketed the money .
`` If I 've any luck , I 'll bring her something that 'll do her more good than the oranges , '' he muttered , as he hurried off to the pasture .
Jordan had a horse of his own now , a rather bony nag , answering to the name of Dan .
Billy Morrison had agreed to pasture the animal if Jordan used him in the farm work , an arrangement scoffed at by Mrs. William in no measured terms .
Jordan hitched Dan into the second best buggy , dressed himself in his Sunday clothes , and drove off .
On the road he re-read a paragraph he had clipped from the Charlottetown Daily Enterprise of the previous day .
`` Joscelyn Burnett , the famous contralto , is spending a few days in Kensington on her return from her Maritime concert tour .
She is the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Bromley , of The Beeches . ''
`` Now if I can get there in time , '' said Jordan emphatically .
Jordan got to Kensington , put Dan up in a livery stable , and inquired the way to The Beeches .
He felt rather nervous when he found it , it was such a stately , imposing place , set back from the street in an emerald green seclusion of beautiful grounds .
`` Fancy me stalking up to that front door and asking for Miss Joscelyn Burnett , '' grinned Jordan sheepishly .
`` Mebbe they 'll tell me to go around to the back and inquire for the cook .
But you 're going just the same , Jordan Sloane , and no skulking .
March right up now .
Think of Aunty Nan and do n't let style down you . ''
A pert-looking maid answered Jordan 's ring , and stared at him when he asked for Miss Burnett .
`` I do n't think you can see her , '' she said shortly , scanning his country cut of hair and clothes rather superciliously .
`` What is your business with her ? ''
The maid 's scorn roused Jordan 's `` dander , '' as he would have expressed it .
`` I 'll tell her that when I see her , '' he retorted coolly .
`` Just you tell her that I 've a message for her from Aunty Nan Morrison of Gull Point Farm , Avonlea .
If she hai n't forgot , that 'll fetch her .
You might as well hurry up , if you please , I 've not overly too much time . ''
The pert maid decided to be civil at least , and invited Jordan to enter .
But she left him standing in the hall while she went in search of Miss Burnett .
Jordan gazed about him in amazement .
He had never been in any place like this before .
The hall was wonderful enough , and through the open doors on either hand stretched vistas of lovely rooms that , to Jordan 's eyes , looked like those of a palace .
`` Gee whiz !
How do they ever move around without knocking things over ? ''
Then Joscelyn Burnett came , and Jordan forgot everything else .
This tall , beautiful woman , in her silken draperies , with a face like nothing Jordan had ever seen , or even dreamed about , -- could this be Aunty Nan 's little Joscelyn ?
Jordan 's round , freckled countenance grew crimson .
He felt horribly tonguetied and embarrassed .
What could he say to her ?
How could he say it ?
Joscelyn Burnett looked at him with her large , dark eyes , -- the eyes of a woman who had suffered much , and learned much , and won through struggle to victory .
`` You have come from Aunty Nan ? ''
she said .
`` Oh , I am so glad to hear from her .
Is she well ?
Come in here and tell me all about her . ''
She turned toward one of those fairy-like rooms , but Jordan interrupted her desperately .
`` Oh , not in there , ma'am .
I 'd never get it out .
Just let me blunder through it out here someways .
Yes 'm , Aunty Nan , she ai n't very well .
She 's -- she 's dying , I guess .
And she 's longing for you night and day .
Seems as if she could n't die in peace without seeing you .
She wanted to get to Kensington to hear you sing , but that old cat of a Mrs. William -- begging you pardon , ma'am -- would n't let her come .
She 's always talking of you .
If you can come out to Gull Point Farm and see her , I 'll be most awful obliged to you , ma'am . ''
Joscelyn Burnett looked troubled .
She had not forgotten Gull Point Farm , nor Aunty Nan ; but for years the memory had been dim , crowded into the background of consciousness by the more exciting events of her busy life .
Now it came back with a rush .
She recalled it all tenderly -- the peace and beauty and love of that olden summer , and sweet Aunty Nan , so very wise in the lore of all things simple and good and true .
For the moment Joscelyn Burnett was a lonely , hungry-hearted little girl again , seeking for love and finding it not , until Aunty Nan had taken her into her great mother-heart and taught her its meaning .
`` Oh , I do n't know , '' she said perplexedly .
`` If you had come sooner -- I leave on the 11:30 train tonight .
I MUST leave by then or I shall not reach Montreal in time to fill a very important engagement .
And yet I must see Aunty Nan , too .
I have been careless and neglectful .
I might have gone to see her before .
How can we manage it ? ''
`` I 'll bring you back to Kensington in time to catch that train , '' said Jordan eagerly .
`` There 's nothing I would n't do for Aunty Nan -- me and Dan .
Yes , sir , you 'll get back in time .
Just think of Aunty Nan 's face when she sees you ! ''
`` I will come , '' said the great singer , gently .
It was sunset when they reached Gull Point Farm .
An arc of warm gold was over the spruces behind the house .
Mrs. William was out in the barn-yard , milking , and the house was deserted , save for the sleeping baby in the kitchen and the little old woman with the watchful eyes in the up-stairs room .
`` This way , ma'am , '' said Jordan , inwardly congratulating himself that the coast was clear .
`` I 'll take you right up to her room . ''
Up-stairs , Joscelyn tapped at the half-open door and went in .
Before it closed behind her , Jordan heard Aunty Nan say , `` Joscelyn !
Little Joscelyn ! ''
in a tone that made him choke again .
He stumbled thankfully down-stairs , to be pounced upon by Mrs. William in the kitchen .
`` Jordan Sloane , who was that stylish woman you drove into the yard with ?
And what have you done with her ? ''
`` That was Miss Joscelyn Burnett , '' said Jordan , expanding himself .
This was his hour of triumph over Mrs. William .
`` I went to Kensington and brung her out to see Aunty Nan .
She 's up with her now . ''
`` Dear me , '' said Mrs. William helplessly .
`` And me in my milking rig !
Jordan , for pity 's sake , hold the baby while I go and put on my black silk .
You might have given a body some warning .
I declare I do n't know which is the greatest idiot , you or Aunty Nan ! ''
As Mrs. William flounced out of the kitchen , Jordan took his satisfaction in a quiet laugh .
Up-stairs in the little room was a great glory of sunset and gladness of human hearts .
Joscelyn was kneeling by the bed , with her arms about Aunty Nan ; and Aunty Nan , with her face all irradiated , was stroking Joscelyn 's dark hair fondly .
`` O , little Joscelyn , '' she murmured , `` it seems too good to be true .
It seems like a beautiful dream .
I knew you the minute you opened the door , my dearie .
You have n't changed a bit .
And you 're a famous singer now , little Joscelyn !
I always knew you would be .
Oh , I want you to sing a piece for me -- just one , wo n't you , dearie ?
Sing that piece people like to hear you sing best .
I forget the name , but I 've read about it in the papers .
Sing it for me , little Joscelyn . ''
And Joscelyn , standing by Aunty Nan 's bed , in the sunset light , sang the song she had sung to many a brilliant audience on many a noted concert-platform -- sang it as even she had never sung before , while Aunty Nan lay and listened beatifically , and downstairs even Mrs. William held her breath , entranced by the exquisite melody that floated through the old farmhouse .
`` O , little Joscelyn ! ''
breathed Aunty Nan in rapture , when the song ended .
Joscelyn knelt by her again and they had a long talk of old days .
One by one they recalled the memories of that vanished summer .
The past gave up its tears and its laughter .
Heart and fancy alike went roaming through the ways of the long ago .
Aunty Nan was perfectly happy .
And then Joscelyn told her all the story of her struggles and triumphs since they had parted .
When the moonlight began to creep in through the low window , Aunty Nan put out her hand and touched Joscelyn 's bowed head .
`` Little Joscelyn , '' she whispered , `` if it ai n't asking too much , I want you to sing just one other piece .
Do you remember when you were here how we sung hymns in the parlour every Sunday night , and my favourite always was ` The Sands of Time are Sinking ? '
I ai n't never forgot how you used to sing that , and I want to hear it just once again , dearie .
Sing it for me , little Joscelyn . ''
Joscelyn rose and went to the window .
Lifting back the curtain , she stood in the splendour of the moonlight , and sang the grand old hymn .
At first Aunty Nan beat time to it feebly on the counterpane ; but when Joscelyn came to the verse , `` With mercy and with judgment , '' she folded her hands over her breast and smiled .
When the hymn ended , Joscelyn came over to the bed .
`` I am afraid I must say good-bye now , Aunty Nan , '' she said .
Then she saw that Aunty Nan had fallen asleep .
She would not waken her , but she took from her breast the cluster of crimson roses she wore and slipped them gently between the toil-worn fingers .
`` Good-bye , dear , sweet mother-heart , '' she murmured .
Down-stairs she met Mrs. William splendid in rustling black silk , her broad , rubicund face smiling , overflowing with apologies and welcomes , which Joscelyn cut short coldly .
`` Thank you , Mrs. Morrison , but I can not possibly stay longer .
No , thank you , I do n't care for any refreshments .
Jordan is going to take me back to Kensington at once .
I came out to see Aunty Nan . ''
`` I 'm certain she 'd be delighted , '' said Mrs. William effusively .
`` She 's been talking about you for weeks . ''
`` Yes , it has made her very happy , '' said Joscelyn gravely .
`` And it has made me happy , too .
I love Aunty Nan , Mrs. Morrison , and I owe her much .
In all my life I have never met a woman so purely , unselfishly good and noble and true . ''
`` Fancy now , '' said Mrs. William , rather overcome at hearing this great singer pronounce such an encomium on quiet , timid old Aunty Nan .
Jordan drove Joscelyn back to Kensington ; and up-stairs in her room Aunty Nan slept , with that rapt smile on her face and Joscelyn 's red roses in her hands .
Thus it was that Mrs. William found her , going in the next morning with her breakfast .
The sunlight crept over the pillow , lighting up the sweet old face and silver hair , and stealing downward to the faded red roses on her breast .
Smiling and peaceful and happy lay Aunty Nan , for she had fallen on the sleep that knows no earthy wakening , while little Joscelyn sang .
V .
The Winning of Lucinda The marriage of a Penhallow was always the signal for a gathering of the Penhallows .
From the uttermost parts of the earth they would come -- Penhallows by birth , and Penhallows by marriage and Penhallows by ancestry .
East Grafton was the ancient habitat of the race , and Penhallow Grange , where `` old '' John Penhallow lived , was a Mecca to them .
As for the family itself , the exact kinship of all its various branches and ramifications was a hard thing to define .
Old Uncle Julius Penhallow was looked upon as a veritable wonder because he carried it all in his head and could tell on sight just what relation any one Penhallow was to any other Penhallow .
The rest made a blind guess at it , for the most part , and the younger Penhallows let it go at loose cousinship .
In this instance it was Alice Penhallow , daughter of `` young '' John Penhallow , who was to be married .
Alice was a nice girl , but she and her wedding only pertain to this story in so far as they furnish a background for Lucinda ; hence nothing more need be said of her .
On the afternoon of her wedding day -- the Penhallows held to the good , old-fashioned custom of evening weddings with a rousing dance afterwards -- Penhallow Grange was filled to overflowing with guests who had come there to have tea and rest themselves before going down to `` young '' John 's .
Many of them had driven fifty miles .
In the big autumnal orchard the younger fry foregathered and chatted and coquetted .
Up-stairs , in `` old '' Mrs. John 's bedroom , she and her married daughters held high conclave .
`` Old '' John had established himself with his sons and sons-in-law in the parlour , and the three daughters-in-law were making themselves at home in the blue sitting-room , ear-deep in harmless family gossip .
Lucinda and Romney Penhallow were also there .
Thin Mrs. Nathaniel Penhallow sat in a rocking chair and toasted her toes at the grate , for the brilliant autumn afternoon was slightly chilly and Lucinda , as usual , had the window open .
She and plump Mrs. Frederick Penhallow did most of the talking .
Mrs. George Penhallow being rather out of it by reason of her newness .
She was George Penhallow 's second wife , married only a year .
Hence , her contributions to the conversation were rather spasmodic , hurled in , as it were , by dead reckoning , being sometimes appropriate and sometimes savouring of a point of view not strictly Penhallowesque .
Romney Penhallow was sitting in a corner , listening to the chatter of the women , with the inscrutable smile that always vexed Mrs. Frederick .
Mrs. George wondered within herself what he did there among the women .
She also wondered just where he belonged on the family tree .
He was not one of the uncles , yet he could not be much younger than George .
`` Forty , if he is a day , '' was Mrs. George 's mental dictum , `` but a very handsome and fascinating man .
I never saw such a splendid chin and dimple . ''
Lucinda , with bronze-colored hair and the whitest of skins , defiant of merciless sunlight and revelling in the crisp air , sat on the sill of the open window behind the crimson vine leaves , looking out into the garden , where dahlias flamed and asters broke into waves of purple and snow .
The ruddy light of the autumn afternoon gave a sheen to the waves of her hair and brought out the exceeding purity of her Greek outlines .
Mrs. George knew who Lucinda was -- a cousin of the second generation , and , in spite of her thirty-five years , the acknowledged beauty of the whole Penhallow connection .
She was one of those rare women who keep their loveliness unmarred by the passage of years .
She had ripened and matured , but she had not grown old .
The older Penhallows were still inclined , from sheer force of habit , to look upon her as a girl , and the younger Penhallows hailed her as one of themselves .
Yet Lucinda never aped girlishness ; good taste and a strong sense of humour preserved her amid many temptations thereto .
She was simply a beautiful , fully developed woman , with whom Time had declared a truce , young with a mellow youth which had nothing to do with years .
Mrs. George liked and admired Lucinda .
Now , when Mrs. George liked and admired any person , it was a matter of necessity with her to impart her opinions to the most convenient confidant .
In this case it was Romney Penhallow to whom Mrs. George remarked sweetly : `` Really , do n't you think our Lucinda is looking remarkably well this fall ? ''
It seemed a very harmless , inane , well-meant question .
Poor Mrs. George might well be excused for feeling bewildered over the effect .
Romney gathered his long legs together , stood up , and swept the unfortunate speaker a crushing Penhallow bow of state .
`` Far be it from me to disagree with the opinion of a lady -- especially when it concerns another lady , '' he said , as he left the blue room .
Overcome by the mordant satire in his tone , Mrs. George glanced speechlessly at Lucinda .
Behold , Lucinda had squarely turned her back on the party and was gazing out into the garden , with a very decided flush on the snowy curves of her neck and cheek .
Then Mrs. George looked at her sisters-in-law .
They were regarding her with the tolerant amusement they might bestow on a blundering child .
Mrs. George experienced that subtle prescience whereby it is given us to know that we have put our foot in it .
She felt herself turning an uncomfortable brick-red .
What Penhallow skeleton had she unwittingly jangled ?
Why , oh , why , was it such an evident breach of the proprieties to praise Lucinda ?
Mrs. George was devoutly thankful that a summons to the tea-table rescued her from her mire of embarrassment .
The meal was spoiled for her , however ; the mortifying recollection of her mysterious blunder conspired with her curiosity to banish appetite .
As soon as possible after tea she decoyed Mrs. Frederick out into the garden and in the dahlia walk solemnly demanded the reason of it all .
Mrs. Frederick indulged in a laugh which put the mettle of her festal brown silk seams to the test .
`` My dear Cecilia , it was SO amusing , '' she said , a little patronizingly .
`` But WHY ! ''
cried Mrs. George , resenting the patronage and the mystery .
`` What was so dreadful in what I said ?
Or so funny ?
And WHO is this Romney Penhallow who must n't be spoken to ? ''
`` Oh , Romney is one of the Charlottetown Penhallows , '' explained Mrs. Frederick .
`` He is a lawyer there .
He is a first cousin of Lucinda 's and a second of George 's -- or is he ?
Oh , bother !
You must go to Uncle John if you want the genealogy .
I 'm in a chronic muddle concerning Penhallow relationship .
And , as for Romney , of course you can speak to him about anything you like except Lucinda .
Oh , you innocent !
To ask him if he did n't think Lucinda was looking well !
And right before her , too !
Of course he thought you did it on purpose to tease him .
That was what made him so savage and sarcastic . ''
`` But WHY ? ''
persisted Mrs. George , sticking tenaciously to her point .
`` Has n't George told you ? ''
`` No , '' said George 's wife in mild exasperation .
`` George has spent most of his time since we were married telling me odd things about the Penhallows , but he has n't got to that yet , evidently . ''
`` Why , my dear , it is our family romance .
Lucinda and Romney are in love with each other .
They have been in love with each other for fifteen years and in all that time they have never spoken to each other once ! ''
`` Dear me ! ''
murmured Mrs. George , feeling the inadequacy of mere language .
Was this a Penhallow method of courtship ?
`` But WHY ? ''
`` They had a quarrel fifteen years ago , '' said Mrs. Frederick patiently .
`` Nobody knows how it originated or anything about it except that Lucinda herself admitted it to us afterwards .
But , in the first flush of her rage , she told Romney that she would never speak to him again as long as she lived .
And HE said he would never speak to her until she spoke first -- because , you see , as she was in the wrong she ought to make the first advance .
And they never have spoken .
Everybody in the connection , I suppose , has taken turns trying to reconcile them , but nobody has succeeded .
I do n't believe that Romney has ever so much as THOUGHT of any other woman in his whole life , and certainly Lucinda has never thought of any other man .
You will notice she still wears Romney 's ring .
They 're practically engaged still , of course .
And Romney said once that if Lucinda would just say one word , no matter what it was , even if it were something insulting , he would speak , too , and beg her pardon for his share in the quarrel -- because then , you see , he would not be breaking his word .
He has n't referred to the matter for years , but I presume that he is of the same mind still .
And they are just as much in love with each other as they ever were .
He 's always hanging about where she is -- when other people are there , too , that is .
He avoids her like a plague when she is alone .
That was why he was stuck out in the blue room with us to-day .
There does n't seem to be a particle of resentment between them .
If Lucinda would only speak !
But that Lucinda will not do . ''
`` Do n't you think she will yet ? ''
said Mrs. George .
Mrs. Frederick shook her crimped head sagely .
`` Not now .
The whole thing has hardened too long .
Her pride will never let her speak .
We used to hope she would be tricked into it by forgetfulness or accident -- we used to lay traps for her -- but all to no effect .
It is such a shame , too .
They were made for each other .
Do you know , I get cross when I begin to thrash the whole silly affair over like this .
Does n't it sound as if we were talking of the quarrel of two school-children ?
Of late years we have learned that it does not do to speak of Lucinda to Romney , even in the most commonplace way .
He seems to resent it . ''
`` HE ought to speak , '' cried Mrs. George warmly .
`` Even if she were in the wrong ten times over , he ought to overlook it and speak first . ''
`` But he wo n't .
And she wo n't .
You never saw two such determined mortals .
They get it from their grandfather on the mother 's side -- old Absalom Gordon .
There is no such stubbornness on the Penhallow side .
His obstinacy was a proverb , my dear -- actually a proverb .
What ever he said , he would stick to if the skies fell .
He was a terrible old man to swear , too , '' added Mrs. Frederick , dropping into irrelevant reminiscence .
`` He spent a long while in a mining camp in his younger days and he never got over it -- the habit of swearing , I mean .
It would have made your blood run cold , my dear , to have heard him go on at times .
And yet he was a real good old man every other way .
He could n't help it someway .
He tried to , but he used to say that profanity came as natural to him as breathing .
It used to mortify his family terribly .
Fortunately , none of them took after him in that respect .
But he 's dead -- and one should n't speak ill of the dead .
I must go and get Mattie Penhallow to do my hair .
I would burst these sleeves clean out if I tried to do it myself and I do n't want to dress over again .
You wo n't be likely to talk to Romney about Lucinda again , my dear Cecilia ? ''
`` Fifteen years ! ''
murmured Mrs. George helplessly to the dahlias .
`` Engaged for fifteen years and never speaking to each other !
Dear heart and soul , think of it !
Oh , these Penhallows ! ''
Meanwhile , Lucinda , serenely unconscious that her love story was being mouthed over by Mrs. Frederick in the dahlia garden , was dressing for the wedding .
Lucinda still enjoyed dressing for a festivity , since the mirror still dealt gently with her .
Moreover , she had a new dress .
Now , a new dress -- and especially one as nice as this -- was a rarity with Lucinda , who belonged to a branch of the Penhallows noted for being chronically hard up .
Indeed , Lucinda and her widowed mother were positively poor , and hence a new dress was an event in Lucinda 's existence .
An uncle had given her this one -- a beautiful , perishable thing , such as Lucinda would never have dared to choose for herself , but in which she revelled with feminine delight .
It was of pale green voile -- a colour which brought out admirably the ruddy gloss of her hair and the clear brilliance of her skin .
When she had finished dressing she looked at herself in the mirror with frank delight .
Lucinda was not vain , but she was quite well aware of the fact of her beauty and took an impersonal pleasure in it , as if she were looking at some finely painted picture by a master hand .
The form and face reflected in the glass satisfied her .
The puffs and draperies of the green voile displayed to perfection the full , but not over-full , curves of her fine figure .
Lucinda lifted her arm and touched a red rose to her lips with the hand upon which shone the frosty glitter of Romney 's diamond , looking at the graceful slope of her shoulder and the splendid line of chin and throat with critical approval .
She noted , too , how well the gown became her eyes , bringing out all the deeper colour in them .
Lucinda had magnificent eyes .
Once Romney had written a sonnet to them in which he compared their colour to ripe blueberries .
This may not sound poetical to you unless you know or remember just what the tints of ripe blueberries are -- dusky purple in some lights , clear slate in others , and yet again in others the misty hue of early meadow violets .
`` You really look very well , '' remarked the real Lucinda to the mirrored Lucinda .
`` Nobody would think you were an old maid .
But you are .
Alice Penhallow , who is to be married to-night , was a child of five when you thought of being married fifteen years ago .
That makes you an old maid , my dear .
Well , it is your own fault , and it will continue to be your own fault , you stubborn offshoot of a stubborn breed ! ''
She flung her train out straight and pulled on her gloves .
`` I do hope I wo n't get any spots on this dress to-night , '' she reflected .
`` It will have to do me for a gala dress for a year at least -- and I have a creepy conviction that it is fearfully spottable .
Bless Uncle Mark 's good , uncalculating heart !
How I would have detested it if he had given me something sensible and useful and ugly -- as Aunt Emilia would have done . ''
They all went to `` young '' John Penhallow 's at early moonrise .
Lucinda drove over the two miles of hill and dale with a youthful second cousin , by name , Carey Penhallow .
The wedding was quite a brilliant affair .
Lucinda seemed to pervade the social atmosphere , and everywhere she went a little ripple of admiration trailed after her like a wave .
She was undeniably a belle , yet she found herself feeling faintly bored and was rather glad than otherwise when the guests began to fray off .
`` I 'm afraid I 'm losing my capacity for enjoyment , '' she thought , a little drearily .
`` Yes , I must be growing old .
That is what it means when social functions begin to bore you . ''
It was that unlucky Mrs. George who blundered again .
She was standing on the veranda when Carey Penhallow dashed up .
`` Tell Lucinda that I ca n't take her back to the Grange .
I have to drive Mark and Cissy Penhallow to Bright River to catch the two o'clock express .
There will be plenty of chances for her with the others . ''
At this moment George Penhallow , holding his rearing horse with difficulty , shouted for his wife .
Mrs. George , all in a flurry , dashed back into the still crowded hall .
Exactly to whom she gave her message was never known to any of the Penhallows .
But a tall , ruddy-haired girl , dressed in pale green organdy -- Anne Shirley from Avonlea -- told Marilla Cuthbert and Rachel Lynde as a joke the next morning how a chubby little woman in a bright pink fascinator had clutched her by the arm , and gasped out : `` Carey Penhallow ca n't take you -- he says you 're to look out for someone else , '' and was gone before she could answer or turn around .
Thus it was that Lucinda , when she came out to the veranda step , found herself unaccountably deserted .
All the Grange Penhallows were gone ; Lucinda realized this after a few moments of bewildered seeking , and she understood that if she were to get to the Grange that night she must walk .
Plainly there was nobody to take her .
Lucinda was angry .
It is not pleasant to find yourself forgotten and neglected .
It is still less pleasant to walk home alone along a country road , at one o'clock in the morning , wearing a pale green voile .
Lucinda was not prepared for such a walk .
She had nothing on her feet save thin-soled shoes , and her only wraps were a flimsy fascinator and a short coat .
`` What a guy I shall look , stalking home alone in this rig , '' she thought crossly .
There was no help for it , unless she confessed her plight to some of the stranger guests and begged a drive home .
Lucinda 's pride scorned such a request and the admission of neglect it involved .
No , she would walk , since that was all there was to it ; but she would not go by the main road to be stared at by all and sundry who might pass her .
There was a short cut by way of a lane across the fields ; she knew every inch of it , although she had not traversed it for years .
She gathered up the green voile as trimly as possible , slipped around the house in the kindly shadows , picked her way across the side lawn , and found a gate which opened into a birch-bordered lane where the frosted trees shone with silvery-golden radiance in the moonlight .
Lucinda flitted down the lane , growing angrier at every step as the realization of how shamefully she seemed to have been treated came home to her .
She believed that nobody had thought about her at all , which was tenfold worse than premeditated neglect .
As she came to the gate at the lower end of the lane a man who was leaning over it started , with a quick intake of his breath , which , in any other man than Romney Penhallow , or for any other woman than Lucinda Penhallow , would have been an exclamation of surprise .
Lucinda recognized him with a great deal of annoyance and a little relief .
She would not have to walk home alone .
But with Romney Penhallow !
Would he think she had contrived it so purposely ?
Romney silently opened the gate for her , silently latched it behind her , and silently fell into step beside her .
Down across a velvety sweep of field they went ; the air was frosty , calm and still ; over the world lay a haze of moonshine and mist that converted East Grafton 's prosaic hills and fields into a shimmering fairyland .
At first Lucinda felt angrier than ever .
What a ridiculous situation !
How the Penhallows would laugh over it !
As for Romney , he , too , was angry with the trick impish chance had played him .
He liked being the butt of an awkward situation as little as most men ; and certainly to be obliged to walk home over moonlit fields at one o'clock in the morning with the woman he had loved and never spoken to for fifteen years was the irony of fate with a vengeance .
Would she think he had schemed for it ?
And how the deuce did she come to be walking home from the wedding at all ?
By the time they had crossed the field and reached the wild cherry lane beyond it , Lucinda 's anger was mastered by her saving sense of humour .
She was even smiling a little maliciously under her fascinator .
The lane was a place of enchantment -- a long , moonlit colonnade adown which beguiling wood nymphs might have footed it featly .
The moonshine fell through the arching boughs and made a mosaic of silver light and clear-cut shadow for the unfriendly lovers to walk in .
On either side was the hovering gloom of the woods , and around them was a great silence unstirred by wind or murmur .
Midway in the lane Lucinda was attacked by a sentimental recollection .
She thought of the last time Romney and she had walked home together through this very lane , from a party at `` young '' John 's .
It had been moonlight then too , and -- Lucinda checked a sigh -- they had walked hand in hand .
Just here , by the big gray beech , he had stopped her and kissed her .
Lucinda wondered if he were thinking of it , too , and stole a look at him from under the lace border of her fascinator .
But he was striding moodily along with his hands in his pockets , and his hat pulled down over his eyes , passing the old beech without a glance at it .
Lucinda checked another sigh , gathered up an escaped flutter of voile , and marched on .
Past the lane a range of three silvery harvest fields sloped down to Peter Penhallow 's brook -- a wide , shallow stream bridged over in the olden days by the mossy trunk of an ancient fallen tree .
When Lucinda and Romney arrived at the brook they gazed at the brawling water blankly .
Lucinda remembered that she must not speak to Romney just in time to prevent an exclamation of dismay .
There was no tree !
There was no bridge of any kind over the brook !
Here was a predicament !
But before Lucinda could do more than despairingly ask herself what was to be done now , Romney answered -- not in words , but in deeds .
He coolly picked Lucinda up in his arms , as if she had been a child instead of a full grown woman of no mean avoirdupois , and began to wade with her through the water .
Lucinda gasped helplessly .
She could not forbid him and she was so choked with rage over his presumption that she could not have spoken in any case .
Then came the catastrophe .
Romney 's foot slipped on a treacherous round stone -- there was a tremendous splash -- and Romney and Lucinda Penhallow were sitting down in the middle of Peter Penhallow 's brook .
Lucinda was the first to regain her feet .
About her clung in heart-breaking limpness the ruined voile .
The remembrance of all her wrongs that night rushed over her soul , and her eyes blazed in the moonlight .
Lucinda Penhallow had never been so angry in her life .
`` YOU D -- D IDIOT ! ''
she said , in a voice that literally shook with rage .
Romney meekly scrambled up the bank after her .
`` I 'm awfully sorry , Lucinda , '' he said , striving with uncertain success to keep a suspicious quiver of laughter out of his tone .
`` It was wretchedly clumsy of me , but that pebble turned right under my foot .
Please forgive me -- for that -- and for other things . ''
Lucinda deigned no answer .
She stood on a flat stone and wrung the water from the poor green voile .
Romney surveyed her apprehensively .
`` Hurry , Lucinda , '' he entreated .
`` You will catch your death of cold . ''
`` I never take cold , '' answered Lucinda , with chattering teeth .
`` And it is my dress I am thinking of -- was thinking of .
You have more need to hurry .
You are sopping wet yourself and you know you are subject to colds .
There -- come . ''
Lucinda picked up the stringy train , which had been so brave and buoyant five minutes before , and started up the field at a brisk rate .
Romney came up to her and slipped his arm through hers in the old way .
For a time they walked along in silence .
Then Lucinda began to shake with inward laughter .
She laughed silently for the whole length of the field ; and at the line fence between Peter Penhallow 's land and the Grange acres she paused , threw back the fascinator from her face , and looked at Romney defiantly .
`` You are thinking of -- THAT , '' she cried , `` and I am thinking of it .
And we will go on , thinking of it at intervals for the rest of our lives .
But if you ever mention it to me I 'll never forgive you , Romney Penhallow ! ''
`` I never will , '' Romney promised .
There was more than a suspicion of laughter in his voice this time , but Lucinda did not choose to resent it .
She did not speak again until they reached the Grange gate .
Then she faced him solemnly .
`` It was a case of atavism , '' she said .
`` Old Grandfather Gordon was to blame for it . ''
At the Grange almost everybody was in bed .
What with the guests straggling home at intervals and hurrying sleepily off to their rooms , nobody had missed Lucinda , each set supposing she was with some other set .
Mrs. Frederick , Mrs. Nathaniel and Mrs. George alone were up .
The perennially chilly Mrs. Nathaniel had kindled a fire of chips in the blue room grate to warm her feet before retiring , and the three women were discussing the wedding in subdued tones when the door opened and the stately form of Lucinda , stately even in the dragged voile , appeared , with the damp Romney behind her .
`` Lucinda Penhallow ! ''
gasped they , one and all .
`` I was left to walk home , '' said Lucinda coolly .
`` So Romney and I came across the fields .
There was no bridge over the brook , and when he was carrying me over he slipped and we fell in .
That is all .
No , Cecilia , I never take cold , so do n't worry .
Yes , my dress is ruined , but that is of no consequence .
No , thank you , Cecilia , I do not care for a hot drink .
Romney , do go and take off those wet clothes of yours immediately .
No , Cecilia , I will NOT take a hot footbath .
I am going straight to bed .
Good night . ''
When the door closed on the pair the three sisters-in-law stared at each other .
Mrs. Frederick , feeling herself incapable of expressing her sensations originally , took refuge in a quotation : '' ` Do I sleep , do I dream , do I wonder and doubt ?
Is things what they seem , or is visions about ? ' ''
`` There will be another Penhallow wedding soon , '' said Mrs. Nathaniel , with a long breath .
`` Lucinda has spoken to Romney AT LAST . ''
`` Oh , WHAT do you suppose she said to him ? ''
cried Mrs. George .
`` My dear Cecilia , '' said Mrs. Frederick , `` we shall never know . ''
They never did know .
VI .
Old Man Shaw 's Girl `` Day after to-morrow -- day after to-morrow , '' said Old Man Shaw , rubbing his long slender hands together gleefully .
`` I have to keep saying it over and over , so as to really believe it .
It seems far too good to be true that I 'm to have Blossom again .
And everything is ready .
Yes , I think everything is ready , except a bit of cooking .
And wo n't this orchard be a surprise to her !
I 'm just going to bring her out here as soon as I can , never saying a word .
I 'll fetch her through the spruce lane , and when we come to the end of the path I 'll step back casual-like , and let her go out from under the trees alone , never suspecting .
It 'll be worth ten times the trouble to see her big , brown eyes open wide and hear her say , ` Oh , daddy !
Why , daddy ! ' ''
He rubbed his hands again and laughed softly to himself .
He was a tall , bent old man , whose hair was snow white , but whose face was fresh and rosy .
His eyes were a boy 's eyes , large , blue and merry , and his mouth had never got over a youthful trick of smiling at any provocation -- and , oft-times , at no provocation at all .
To be sure , White Sands people would not have given you the most favourable opinion in the world of Old Man Shaw .
First and foremost , they would have told you that he was `` shiftless , '' and had let his bit of a farm run out while he pottered with flowers and bugs , or rambled aimlessly about in the woods , or read books along the shore .
Perhaps it was true ; but the old farm yielded him a living , and further than that Old Man Shaw had no ambition .
He was as blithe as a pilgrim on a pathway climbing to the west .
He had learned the rare secret that you must take happiness when you find it -- that there is no use in marking the place and coming back to it at a more convenient season , because it will not be there then .
And it is very easy to be happy if you know , as Old Man Shaw most thoroughly knew , how to find pleasure in little things .
He enjoyed life , he had always enjoyed life and helped others to enjoy it ; consequently his life was a success , whatever White Sands people might think of it .
What if he had not `` improved '' his farm ?
There are some people to whom life will never be anything more than a kitchen garden ; and there are others to whom it will always be a royal palace with domes and minarets of rainbow fancy .
The orchard of which he was so proud was as yet little more than the substance of things hoped for -- a flourishing plantation of young trees which would amount to something later on .
Old Man Shaw 's house was on the crest of a bare , sunny hill , with a few staunch old firs and spruces behind it -- the only trees that could resist the full sweep of the winds that blew bitterly up from the sea at times .
Fruit trees would never grow near it , and this had been a great grief to Sara .
`` Oh , daddy , if we could just have an orchard ! ''
she had been wont to say wistfully , when other farmhouses in White Sands were smothered whitely in apple bloom .
And when she had gone away , and her father had nothing to look forward to save her return , he was determined she should find an orchard when she came back .
Over the southward hill , warmly sheltered by spruce woods and sloping to the sunshine , was a little field , so fertile that all the slack management of a life-time had not availed to exhaust it .
Here Old Man Shaw set out his orchard and saw it flourish , watching and tending it until he came to know each tree as a child and loved it .
His neighbours laughed at him , and said that the fruit of an orchard so far away from the house would all be stolen .
But as yet there was no fruit , and when the time came for bearing there would be enough and to spare .
`` Blossom and me 'll get all we want , and the boys can have the rest , if they want 'em worse 'n they want a good conscience , '' said that unworldly , unbusinesslike Old Man Shaw .
On his way back home from his darling orchard he found a rare fern in the woods and dug it up for Sara -- she had loved ferns .
He planted it at the shady , sheltered side of the house and then sat down on the old bench by the garden gate to read her last letter -- the letter that was only a note , because she was coming home soon .
He knew every word of it by heart , but that did not spoil the pleasure of re-reading it every half-hour .
Old Man Shaw had not married until late in life , and had , so White Sands people said , selected a wife with his usual judgment -- which , being interpreted , meant no judgment at all ; otherwise , he would never have married Sara Glover , a mere slip of a girl , with big brown eyes like a frightened wood creature 's , and the delicate , fleeting bloom of a spring Mayflower .
`` The last woman in the world for a farmer 's wife -- no strength or get-up about her . ''
Neither could White Sands folk understand what on earth Sara Glover had married him for .
`` Well , the fool crop was the only one that never failed . ''
Old Man Shaw -- he was Old Man Shaw even then , although he was only forty -- and his girl bride had troubled themselves not at all about White Sands opinions .
They had one year of perfect happiness , which is always worth living for , even if the rest of life be a dreary pilgrimage , and then Old Man Shaw found himself alone again , except for little Blossom .
She was christened Sara , after her dead mother , but she was always Blossom to her father -- the precious little blossom whose plucking had cost the mother her life .
Sara Glover 's people , especially a wealthy aunt in Montreal , had wanted to take the child , but Old Man Shaw grew almost fierce over the suggestion .
He would give his baby to no one .
A woman was hired to look after the house , but it was the father who cared for the baby in the main .
He was as tender and faithful and deft as a woman .
Sara never missed a mother 's care , and she grew up into a creature of life and light and beauty , a constant delight to all who knew her .
She had a way of embroidering life with stars .
She was dowered with all the charming characteristics of both parents , with a resilient vitality and activity which had pertained to neither of them .
When she was ten years old she had packed all hirelings off , and kept house for her father for six delightful years -- years in which they were father and daughter , brother and sister , and `` chums . ''
Sara never went to school , but her father saw to her education after a fashion of his own .
When their work was done they lived in the woods and fields , in the little garden they had made on the sheltered side of the house , or on the shore , where sunshine and storm were to them equally lovely and beloved .
Never was comradeship more perfect or more wholly satisfactory .
`` Just wrapped up in each other , '' said White Sands folk , half-enviously , half-disapprovingly .
When Sara was sixteen Mrs. Adair , the wealthy aunt aforesaid , pounced down on White Sands in a glamour of fashion and culture and outer worldliness .
She bombarded Old Man Shaw with such arguments that he had to succumb .
It was a shame that a girl like Sara should grow up in a place like White Sands , `` with no advantages and no education , '' said Mrs. Adair scornfully , not understanding that wisdom and knowledge are two entirely different things .
`` At least let me give my dear sister 's child what I would have given my own daughter if I had had one , '' she pleaded tearfully .
`` Let me take her with me and send her to a good school for a few years .
Then , if she wishes , she may come back to you , of course . ''
Privately , Mrs. Adair did not for a moment believe that Sara would want to come back to White Sands , and her queer old father , after three years of the life she would give her .
Old Man Shaw yielded , influenced thereto not at all by Mrs. Adair 's readily flowing tears , but greatly by his conviction that justice to Sara demanded it .
Sara herself did not want to go ; she protested and pleaded ; but her father , having become convinced that it was best for her to go , was inexorable .
Everything , even her own feelings , must give way to that .
But she was to come back to him without let or hindrance when her `` schooling '' was done .
It was only on having this most clearly understood that Sara would consent to go at all .
Her last words , called back to her father through her tears as she and her aunt drove down the lane , were , `` I 'll be back , daddy .
In three years I 'll be back .
Do n't cry , but just look forward to that . ''
He had looked forward to it through the three long , lonely years that followed , in all of which he never saw his darling .
Half a continent was between them and Mrs. Adair had vetoed vacation visits , under some specious pretense .
But every week brought its letter from Sara .
Old Man Shaw had every one of them , tied up with one of her old blue hair ribbons , and kept in her mother 's little rose-wood work-box in the parlour .
He spent every Sunday afternoon re-reading them , with her photograph before him .
He lived alone , refusing to be pestered with kind help , but he kept the house in beautiful order .
`` A better housekeeper than farmer , '' said White Sands people .
He would have nothing altered .
When Sara came back she was not to be hurt by changes .
It never occurred to him that she might be changed herself .
And now those three interminable years were gone , and Sara was coming home .
She wrote him nothing of her aunt 's pleadings and reproaches and ready , futile tears ; she wrote only that she would graduate in June and start for home a week later .
Thenceforth Old Man Shaw went about in a state of beatitude , making ready for her homecoming .
As he sat on the bench in the sunshine , with the blue sea sparkling and crinkling down at the foot of the green slope , he reflected with satisfaction that all was in perfect order .
There was nothing left to do save count the hours until that beautiful , longed-for day after to-morrow .
He gave himself over to a reverie , as sweet as a day-dream in a haunted valley .
The red roses were out in bloom .
Sara had always loved those red roses -- they were as vivid as herself , with all her own fullness of life and joy of living .
And , besides these , a miracle had happened in Old Man Shaw 's garden .
In one corner was a rose-bush which had never bloomed , despite all the coaxing they had given it -- `` the sulky rose-bush , '' Sara had been wont to call it .
Lo !
this summer had flung the hoarded sweetness of years into plentiful white blossoms , like shallow ivory cups with a haunting , spicy fragrance .
It was in honour of Sara 's home-coming -- so Old Man Shaw liked to fancy .
All things , even the sulky rose-bush , knew she was coming back , and were making glad because of it .
He was gloating over Sara 's letter when Mrs. Peter Blewett came .
She told him she had run up to see how he was getting on , and if he wanted anything seen to before Sara came .
`` No 'm , thank you , ma'am .
Everything is attended to .
I could n't let anyone else prepare for Blossom .
Only to think , ma'am , she 'll be home the day after to-morrow .
I 'm just filled clear through , body , soul , and spirit , with joy to think of having my little Blossom at home again . ''
Mrs. Blewett smiled sourly .
When Mrs. Blewett smiled it foretokened trouble , and wise people had learned to have sudden business elsewhere before the smile could be translated into words .
But Old Man Shaw had never learned to be wise where Mrs. Blewett was concerned , although she had been his nearest neighbour for years , and had pestered his life out with advice and `` neighbourly turns . ''
Mrs. Blewett was one with whom life had gone awry .
The effect on her was to render happiness to other people a personal insult .
She resented Old Man Shaw 's beaming delight in his daughter 's return , and she `` considered it her duty '' to rub the bloom off straightway .
`` Do you think Sary 'll be contented in White Sands now ? ''
she asked .
Old Man Shaw looked slightly bewildered .
`` Of course she 'll be contented , '' he said slowly .
`` Is n't it her home ?
And ai n't I here ? ''
Mrs. Blewett smiled again , with double distilled contempt for such simplicity .
`` Well , it 's a good thing you 're so sure of it , I suppose .
If 't was my daughter that was coming back to White Sands , after three years of fashionable life among rich , stylish folks , and at a swell school , I would n't have a minute 's peace of mind .
I 'd know perfectly well that she 'd look down on everything here , and be discontented and miserable . ''
`` YOUR daughter might , '' said Old Man Shaw , with more sarcasm than he had supposed he had possessed , `` but Blossom wo n't . ''
Mrs. Blewett shrugged her sharp shoulders .
`` Maybe not .
It 's to be hoped not , for both your sakes , I 'm sure .
But I 'd be worried if 't was me .
Sary 's been living among fine folks , and having a gay , exciting time , and it stands to reason she 'll think White Sands fearful lonesome and dull .
Look at Lauretta Bradley .
She was up in Boston for just a month last winter and she 's never been able to endure White Sands since . ''
`` Lauretta Bradley and Sara Shaw are two different people , '' said Sara 's father , trying to smile .
`` And your house , too , '' pursued Mrs. Blewett ruthlessly .
`` It 's such a queer , little , old place .
What 'll she think of it after her aunt 's ?
I 've heard tell Mrs. Adair lives in a perfect palace .
I 'll just warn you kindly that Sary 'll probably look down on you , and you might as well be prepared for it .
Of course , I suppose she kind of thinks she has to come back , seeing she promised you so solemn she would .
But I 'm certain she does n't want to , and I do n't blame her either . ''
Even Mrs. Blewett had to stop for breath , and Old Man Shaw found his opportunity .
He had listened , dazed and shrinking , as if she were dealing him physical blows , but now a swift change swept over him .
His blue eyes flashed ominously , straight into Mrs. Blewett 's straggling , ferrety gray orbs .
`` If you 're said your say , Martha Blewett , you can go , '' he said passionately .
`` I 'm not going to listen to another such word .
Take yourself out of my sight , and your malicious tongue out of my hearing ! ''
Mrs. Blewett went , too dumfounded by such an unheard-of outburst in mild Old Man Shaw to say a word of defence or attack .
When she had gone Old Man Shaw , the fire all faded from his eyes , sank back on his bench .
His delight was dead ; his heart was full of pain and bitterness .
Martha Blewett was a warped and ill-natured woman , but he feared there was altogether too much truth in what she said .
Why had he never thought of it before ?
Of course White Sands would seem dull and lonely to Blossom ; of course the little gray house where she was born would seem a poor abode after the splendours of her aunt 's home .
Old Man Shaw walked through his garden and looked at everything with new eyes .
How poor and simple everything was !
How sagging and weather-beaten the old house !
He went in , and up-stairs to Sara 's room .
It was neat and clean , just as she had left it three years ago .
But it was small and dark ; the ceiling was discoloured , the furniture old-fashioned and shabby ; she would think it a poor , mean place .
Even the orchard over the hill brought him no comfort now .
Blossom would not care for orchards .
She would be ashamed of her stupid old father and the barren farm .
She would hate White Sands , and chafe at the dull existence , and look down on everything that went to make up his uneventful life .
Old Man Shaw was unhappy enough that night to have satisfied even Mrs. Blewett had she known .
He saw himself as he thought White Sands folk must see him -- a poor , shiftless , foolish old man , who had only one thing in the world worthwhile , his little girl , and had not been of enough account to keep her .
`` Oh , Blossom , Blossom ! ''
