1	Yet	_	_
2	I	_	_

1	O	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	Sylvia	_	_
4	,	_	_
5	I	_	_

1	A	_	_
2	week	_	_
3	later	_	_
4	there	_	_
5	was	_	_
6	another	_	_
7	entry	_	_
8	:	_	_
9	July	_	_
10	Seventeenth	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	am	_	_
3	afraid	_	_
4	.	_	_

1	To-day	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	met	_	_
4	Sylvia	_	_
5	's	_	_
6	eyes	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	In	_	_
2	them	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	a	_	_
5	look	_	_
6	which	_	_
7	at	_	1:OTH
8	first	_	1
9	stirred	_	_
10	my	_	_
11	heart	_	_
12	to	_	_
13	its	_	_
14	deeps	_	_
15	with	_	_
16	tumultuous	_	_
17	delight	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	and	_	_
20	then	_	_
21	I	_	_
22	remembered	_	_
23	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	must	_	_
3	spare	_	_
4	her	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	suffering	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	at	_	_
9	whatever	_	_
10	cost	_	_
11	to	_	_
12	myself	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	must	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	let	_	_
5	myself	_	_
6	dwell	_	1:OTH
7	on	_	1
8	the	_	_
9	dangerous	_	_
10	sweetness	_	_
11	of	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	thought	_	_
14	that	_	_
15	her	_	_
16	heart	_	_
17	is	_	_
18	turning	_	_
19	to	_	_
20	me	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	What	_	_
2	would	_	_
3	be	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	crowning	_	_
6	joy	_	_
7	to	_	_
8	another	_	_
9	man	_	_
10	could	_	_
11	be	_	_
12	only	_	_
13	added	_	_
14	sorrow	_	_
15	to	_	_
16	me	_	_
17	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	:	_	_
3	July	_	_
4	Eighteenth	_	_
5	.	_	_

1	This	_	_
2	morning	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	took	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	train	_	_
7	to	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	city	_	_
10	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	determined	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	know	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	worst	_	_
8	once	_	1:OTH
9	for	_	1;2:OTH
10	all	_	1;2
11	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	time	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	come	_	1:OTH;1:OTH
5	when	_	_
6	I	_	_
7	must	_	_
8	.	_	_

1	My	_	_
2	doctor	_	_
3	at	_	1:OTH
4	home	_	1
5	had	_	_
6	put	_	_
7	me	_	_
8	off	_	_
9	with	_	_
10	vague	_	_
11	hopes	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	perhapses	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	went	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	a	_	_
6	noted	_	_
7	physician	_	_
8	in	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	city	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	told	_	_
3	him	_	_
4	I	_	_
5	wanted	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	whole	_	1:OTH
8	truth	_	1
9	--	_	_
10	I	_	_
11	made	_	_
12	him	_	_
13	tell	_	_
14	it	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	Stripped	_	_
2	of	_	_
3	all	_	_
4	softening	_	_
5	verbiage	_	_
6	it	_	_
7	is	_	_
8	this	_	_
9	:	_	_
10	I	_	_
11	have	_	_
12	perhaps	_	_
13	eight	_	_
14	months	_	_
15	or	_	_
16	a	_	_
17	year	_	_
18	to	_	_
19	live	_	_
20	--	_	_
21	no	_	1:OTH
22	more	_	1
23	!	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	expected	_	_
4	it	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	although	_	_
7	not	_	_
8	quite	_	1:OTH
9	so	_	1
10	soon	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	Yet	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	certainty	_	_
4	was	_	_
5	none	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	less	_	_
8	bitter	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	this	_	_
3	is	_	_
4	no	_	1:OTH
5	time	_	1
6	for	_	1
7	self-pity	_	_
8	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	is	_	_
3	of	_	_
4	Sylvia	_	_
5	I	_	_
6	must	_	_
7	think	_	_
8	now	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	shall	_	_
3	go	_	2:OTH
4	away	_	2
5	at	_	1:OTH
6	once	_	1
7	,	_	_
8	before	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	sweet	_	_
11	fancy	_	_
12	which	_	_
13	is	_	_
14	possibly	_	_
15	budding	_	_
16	in	_	_
17	her	_	_
18	virgin	_	_
19	heart	_	_
20	shall	_	_
21	have	_	_
22	bloomed	_	_
23	into	_	_
24	a	_	_
25	flower	_	_
26	that	_	_
27	might	_	_
28	poison	_	_
29	some	_	_
30	of	_	_
31	her	_	_
32	fair	_	_
33	years	_	_
34	.	_	_

1	July	_	_
2	Nineteenth	_	_
3	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	is	_	_
3	over	_	_
4	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	said	_	_
3	good-bye	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	her	_	_
6	to-day	_	_
7	before	_	_
8	others	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	for	_	_
11	I	_	_
12	dared	_	_
13	not	_	_
14	trust	_	_
15	myself	_	_
16	to	_	_
17	see	_	_
18	her	_	_
19	alone	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	looked	_	_
3	hurt	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	startled	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	as	_	_
8	if	_	_
9	someone	_	_
10	had	_	_
11	struck	_	_
12	her	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	she	_	_
3	will	_	_
4	soon	_	_
5	forget	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	even	_	_
8	if	_	_
9	I	_	_
10	have	_	_
11	not	_	_

1	As	_	_
2	for	_	_
3	me	_	_
4	,	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	bitterness	_	_
7	of	_	_
8	death	_	_
9	is	_	_
10	already	_	_
11	over	_	_
12	in	_	1:OTH
13	that	_	1

1	All	_	_

1	From	_	_
2	further	_	_
3	entries	_	_
4	in	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	journal	_	_
7	I	_	_
8	learned	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	entries	_	_
3	during	_	_

1	In	_	_
2	all	_	1:OTH

4	them	_	_
5	he	_	_

1	Finally	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	after	_	_
4	a	_	_
5	long	_	_
6	silence	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	he	_	_

10	written	_	_

12	I	_	_
13	think	_	_
14	the	_	_

17	not	_	_
18	far	_	_
19	off	_	_
20	now	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	am	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	sorry	_	_
5	for	_	_
6	my	_	_

9	been	_	_
10	great	_	_
11	of	_	1:OTH
12	late	_	1

1	Last	_	_
2	night	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	was	_	_
5	easier	_	_
6	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	slept	_	_
3	and	_	_
4	dreamed	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	I	_	_
7	saw	_	_
8	Sylvia	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	Once	_	_
2	or	_	_
3	twice	_	_
4	I	_	_
5	thought	_	_
6	that	_	_
7	I	_	_
8	would	_	_
9	arrange	_	_
10	to	_	_
11	have	_	_
12	this	_	_
13	book	_	_
14	sent	_	_

16	her	_	_
17	after	_	_
18	my	_	_
19	death	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	have	_	_
4	decided	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	it	_	_
7	would	_	_
8	be	_	_
9	unwise	_	_
10	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	would	_	_
3	only	_	_
4	pain	_	_
5	her	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	so	_	_
8	I	_	_
9	shall	_	_

1	Jims	_	_
2	himself	_	_
3	did	_	_
4	n't	_	_
5	mind	_	_
6	much	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	liked	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	smaller	_	_
5	rooms	_	_
6	in	_	_
7	their	_	_
8	former	_	_

12	but	_	_
13	the	_	_
14	Garden	_	_

17	made	_	_
18	up	_	_
19	for	_	1:OTH
20	all	_	1
21	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	such	_	1:OTH
4	a	_	1
5	beautiful	_	_
6	spot	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	Just	_	_
2	inside	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	wall	_	_
5	was	_	_
6	a	_	_
7	row	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	aspen	_	_
10	poplars	_	_
11	that	_	_
12	always	_	_
13	talked	_	_
14	in	_	_
15	silvery	_	_
16	whispers	_	_
17	and	_	_
18	shook	_	_
19	their	_	_

22	heart-shaped	_	_
23	leaves	_	_
24	at	_	_
25	him	_	_
26	.	_	_

1	Beyond	_	_
2	them	_	_
3	,	_	_
4	under	_	_
5	scattered	_	_
6	pines	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	was	_	_
9	a	_	_
10	rockery	_	_
11	where	_	_

13	and	_	_
14	wild	_	_
15	things	_	_
16	grew	_	_
17	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	almost	_	_
4	as	_	_
5	good	_	_
6	as	_	_
7	a	_	_
8	bit	_	_
9	of	_	_
10	woods	_	_
11	--	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	Jims	_	_
14	loved	_	_
15	the	_	_
16	woods	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	though	_	_
19	he	_	_
20	scarcely	_	1:OTH
21	ever	_	1
22	saw	_	_
23	them	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	past	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	pines	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	were	_	_
8	roses	_	_
9	just	_	_
10	breaking	_	_
11	into	_	_
12	June	_	_
13	bloom	_	_
14	--	_	_
15	roses	_	_
16	in	_	_
17	such	_	_

20	Jims	_	_
21	had	_	_
22	n't	_	_

27	dear	_	_
28	little	_	_
29	paths	_	_
30	twisting	_	_
31	about	_	_
32	among	_	_
33	the	_	_
34	bushes	_	_
35	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	seemed	_	_
3	to	_	_
4	be	_	_
5	a	_	_
6	garden	_	_
7	where	_	_
8	no	_	_
9	frost	_	_
10	could	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	rain	_	_

9	.	_	_

1	Past	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	roses	_	_
4	one	_	_

1	The	_	_

3	grew	_	_
4	so	_	_

6	that	_	_
7	they	_	_

9	hid	_	_
10	the	_	_
