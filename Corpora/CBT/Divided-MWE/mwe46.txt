6	the	_	_

20	whose	_	_

25	in	_	_
26	dancing	_	_
27	on	_	_
28	the	_	_
29	crests	_	_
30	of	_	_
31	the	_	_

1	As	_	_
2	I	_	_

6	fancied	_	_
7	you	_	_
8	akin	_	_

15	and	_	_
16	thought	_	_
17	how	_	_

19	it	_	_

21	be	_	_

24	with	_	_

48	and	_	_
49	,	_	_
50	when	_	_
51	our	_	_
52	Northern	_	_

54	grew	_	_

66	far	_	_
67	amid	_	_

70	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	yet	_	_
3	it	_	_
4	gladdened	_	_
5	me	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	after	_	1:OTH
8	all	_	1
9	this	_	_

17	a	_	_
