1	Of	_	_
2	course	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	would	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	for	_	_
7	I	_	_
8	liked	_	_
9	him	_	_
10	directly	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	he	_	_
13	was	_	_
14	so	_	_
15	cheery	_	_
16	and	_	_
17	confiding	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	and	_	_
20	seemed	_	_
21	as	_	_
22	glad	_	_

12	alone	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	like	_	_
15	myself	_	_

1	So	_	_

24	feel	_	_
25	hurt	_	_
26	at	_	_
27	my	_	_
28	reception	_	_
29	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	seemed	_	_
3	to	_	_
4	understand	_	_
5	me	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	buzzed	_	_
9	again	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	evidently	_	_
12	saying	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	--	_	_

1	A	_	_
2	few	_	_
3	taps	_	_
4	with	_	_
5	my	_	_

12	more	_	_
13	propriety	_	_
14	,	_	_

1	On	_	_
