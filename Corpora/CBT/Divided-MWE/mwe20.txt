1	So	_	_
2	busily	_	_
3	was	_	_

30	.	_	_

1	At	_	_
2	first	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	was	_	_
5	very	_	_
6	much	_	_
7	frightened	_	_
8	;	_	_
9	for	_	_
10	there	_	_
11	was	_	_
12	no	_	_
13	one	_	_
14	in	_	_
15	sight	_	_
16	on	_	_
17	land	_	_
18	or	_	_
19	sea	_	_
20	,	_	_
21	and	_	_
22	I	_	_
23	did	_	_
24	n't	_	_
25	know	_	_
26	where	_	_
27	I	_	_
28	might	_	_
29	drift	_	_
30	to	_	_
31	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	water	_	_
4	was	_	_
5	calm	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	the	_	_

9	clear	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	wind	_	_
14	blew	_	_
15	balmily	_	_
16	;	_	_
17	so	_	_
18	I	_	_
19	waited	_	_
20	for	_	_
21	what	_	_
22	should	_	_
23	happen	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	Presently	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	saw	_	_
4	a	_	_
5	speck	_	_
6	on	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	sea	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	eagerly	_	_
12	watched	_	_
13	it	_	_
14	;	_	_
15	for	_	1:OTH
16	it	_	1
17	drew	_	_
18	rapidly	_	_
19	near	_	_

21	and	_	_
22	seemed	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	it	_	_
3	came	_	_
4	closer	_	_

6	I	_	_

24	the	_	_

1	It	_	_
