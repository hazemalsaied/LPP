2	the	_	_

1	The	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	cut	_	_
4	himself	_	_
5	some	_	_

19	he	_	_
20	called	_	_

11	he	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	fox	_	_
3	soon	_	_
4	heard	_	_

7	,	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	this	_	_

23	he	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	longed	_	_
3	to	_	_
4	get	_	2:OTH
5	at	_	1:OTH;2
6	it	_	1
7	;	_	_
8	but	_	_
9	was	_	_
10	the	_	_

13	enough	_	_

18	?	_	_

1	It	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	stretched	_	_

8	upon	_	_

1	Another	_	_

8	out	_	_

32	the	_	_

1	he	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	eaglets	_	_
4	answered	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	they	_	_
7	could	_	_
8	not	_	_
9	tell	_	_
10	,	_	_

25	and	_	_
26	the	_	_
27	eagle	_	_
28	wondered	_	_
29	,	_	_
30	as	_	_
31	he	_	_
32	looked	_	_
33	,	_	_
34	whether	_	_
35	the	_	_
36	little	_	1:OTH
37	girl	_	1
38	had	_	_
39	brought	_	_
40	him	_	_

44	it	_	_
45	was	_	_
46	her	_	_
47	magic	_	_
48	which	_	_
49	had	_	_
50	killed	_	_
51	his	_	_

1	`	_	_
2	Children	_	_
3	,	_	_
4	'	_	_
5	he	_	_

7	,	_	_
8	'	_	_
9	I	_	_
10	brought	_	_
11	her	_	_
12	here	_	_
13	for	_	_
14	your	_	_
15	dinner	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	and	_	_
18	you	_	_
19	have	_	_
20	not	_	_
21	touched	_	_
22	her	_	_
23	;	_	_
24	what	_	_
25	is	_	_
26	the	_	_
27	meaning	_	_
28	of	_	_
29	this	_	_
30	?	_	_
31	'	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	eaglets	_	_
4	did	_	_
5	not	_	_
6	answer	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	Wildrose	_	_
10	opened	_	_
11	her	_	_
12	eyes	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	seemed	_	_
16	seven	_	_
17	times	_	_
18	lovelier	_	_
19	than	_	_
20	before	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	From	_	_
2	that	_	_
3	day	_	_
4	Wildrose	_	_
5	lived	_	_
6	like	_	_
7	a	_	_
8	little	_	_
9	princess	_	_
10	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	eagle	_	_
3	flew	_	_
4	about	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	wood	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	collected	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	softest	_	_
11	,	_	_

14	he	_	_

18	make	_	_
19	her	_	_
20	a	_	_
21	bed	_	_
22	,	_	_
23	and	_	_
24	then	_	_
25	he	_	_
26	picked	_	_
27	with	_	_
28	his	_	_
29	beak	_	_
30	all	_	1:OTH
31	the	_	1
32	brightest	_	_

39	or	_	_
40	on	_	_
41	the	_	_
42	mountains	_	_
43	to	_	_
44	decorate	_	_
45	it	_	_
46	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	cleverly	_	_
3	did	_	_
4	he	_	_
5	manage	_	_
6	it	_	_
7	that	_	_
8	there	_	_
9	was	_	_
10	not	_	_
11	a	_	_
12	fairy	_	_
13	in	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	whole	_	_
16	of	_	_
17	the	_	_
18	forest	_	_
19	who	_	_
20	would	_	_
21	not	_	_
22	have	_	_
23	been	_	_
24	pleased	_	_
25	to	_	_
26	sleep	_	_
27	there	_	_
28	,	_	_
29	rocked	_	_
30	to	_	_
31	and	_	_
32	fro	_	_
33	by	_	_
34	the	_	_
35	breeze	_	_
36	on	_	_
37	the	_	_
38	treetops	_	_
39	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	when	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	little	_	_
5	ones	_	_
6	were	_	_
7	able	_	_
8	to	_	_
9	fly	_	_
10	from	_	_
11	their	_	_
12	nest	_	_
13	he	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	time	_	_
4	passed	_	_
5	by	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_

19	she	_	_
20	lived	_	_
21	happily	_	_
22	in	_	_
23	her	_	_
24	nest	_	_
25	and	_	_
26	never	_	_

2	so	_	_
3	the	_	_

1	The	_	_

33	almost	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	nothing	_	_

1	He	_	_

1	No	_	_

1	Peter	_	_

7	the	_	_
8	treasure	_	_
9	mountain	_	_
10	successfully	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	without	_	_

14	found	_	_
15	out	_	_
16	by	_	_
17	anybody	_	_
18	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	enjoyed	_	_
4	himself	_	_
5	by	_	1:OTH
6	the	_	1
7	way	_	1
8	,	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	taken	_	_
11	his	_	_
12	own	_	_
13	time	_	_
14	,	_	_
15	until	_	_
16	he	_	_
17	actually	_	_
18	reached	_	_
19	the	_	_
20	little	_	_
21	brook	_	_
22	in	_	_
23	the	_	_
24	valley	_	_
25	which	_	_
26	it	_	_
27	had	_	_
28	cost	_	_
29	him	_	_
30	some	_	_
31	trouble	_	_
32	to	_	_
33	find	_	_
34	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	pressed	_	_
4	on	_	_
5	eagerly	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	soon	_	_
9	came	_	_

14	in	_	_
15	the	_	_
16	wood	_	_
17	;	_	_
18	down	_	_
19	he	_	_
20	went	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	burrowing	_	_
23	like	_	_
24	a	_	_
25	mole	_	_
26	into	_	_
27	the	_	_
28	earth	_	_
29	;	_	_
30	the	_	_
31	magic	_	_

1	You	_	_
2	may	_	_
3	imagine	_	_
4	how	_	_
5	gaily	_	_
6	Peter	_	_
7	filled	_	_
8	his	_	_
9	sack	_	_
10	with	_	_
11	as	_	_
12	much	_	_
13	gold	_	_
14	as	_	_
15	he	_	_
16	could	_	_
17	carry	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	and	_	1:OTH
20	how	_	1
21	he	_	_
22	staggered	_	_
23	up	_	_
24	the	_	_
25	seventy-seven	_	_
26	steps	_	_
27	with	_	_
28	a	_	_

30	full	_	_
31	of	_	_
32	hope	_	_
33	and	_	_
34	delight	_	_
35	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	did	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	quite	_	_
5	trust	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	gnome	_	_
8	's	_	_
9	promises	_	_
10	of	_	_
11	safety	_	_
12	,	_	_
13	and	_	_
14	was	_	_
15	in	_	_
16	such	_	_
17	haste	_	_
18	to	_	_
19	find	_	_
20	himself	_	_
21	once	_	_
22	more	_	_
23	in	_	_
24	the	_	_
25	light	_	1:OTH
26	of	_	1
27	day	_	1
28	that	_	_
29	he	_	_
30	looked	_	_
31	neither	_	_
32	to	_	_
33	the	_	_
34	right	_	_
35	nor	_	_
36	the	_	_
37	left	_	_
38	,	_	_
39	and	_	_
40	could	_	_
41	not	_	_
42	afterwards	_	_
43	remember	_	_
44	whether	_	_
45	the	_	_
46	walls	_	_
47	and	_	_
48	pillars	_	_
49	had	_	_
50	sparkled	_	_
51	with	_	_
52	jewels	_	_
53	or	_	_
54	not	_	_
55	.	_	_

1	However	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	all	_	_
4	went	_	_
5	well	_	_
6	--	_	_
7	he	_	_
8	neither	_	_
9	saw	_	_
10	nor	_	_
11	heard	_	_
12	anything	_	_

18	that	_	_
19	happened	_	_

26	shut	_	_
27	with	_	_
28	a	_	_
29	crash	_	_
30	as	_	_
31	soon	_	_
32	as	_	_
33	he	_	_
34	was	_	_
35	fairly	_	_
36	outside	_	_
37	it	_	_
38	,	_	_
39	and	_	_
40	then	_	_
41	he	_	_
42	remembered	_	_
43	that	_	_
44	he	_	_
45	had	_	_
46	left	_	_
47	the	_	_
48	magic	_	_
49	root	_	_
50	behind	_	_
51	him	_	_
52	,	_	_
53	so	_	_
54	he	_	_
55	could	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	even	_	_

7	Peter	_	_

10	he	_	_
