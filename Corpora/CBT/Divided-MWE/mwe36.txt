1	This	_	_

6	perhaps	_	_
7	she	_	_

1	Stephen	_	_

22	fresh-cheeked	_	_
23	valley	_	_

1	The	_	_

8	soon	_	_
9	made	_	_
10	friends	_	_
11	with	_	_
12	him	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	Yet	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	felt	_	_
4	himself	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	stranger	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	alien	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	whom	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	long	_	_

16	years	_	_
17	had	_	_

20	from	_	_
21	his	_	_
22	old	_	_
23	place	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	and	_	_
3	Stephen	_	_
4	talked	_	_
5	late	_	_
6	that	_	_
7	night	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	in	_	_
11	the	_	_
12	morning	_	_
13	he	_	_
14	yielded	_	_
15	to	_	_
16	their	_	_
17	entreaties	_	_
18	to	_	_
19	stay	_	_
20	another	_	_
21	day	_	_
22	with	_	_
23	them	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	spent	_	_
3	it	_	_
4	wandering	_	_
5	about	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	farm	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	old	_	_
11	haunts	_	_
12	of	_	_
13	wood	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	stream	_	_
16	.	_	_

1	Yet	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	could	_	_
4	not	_	_
5	find	_	_
6	himself	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	This	_	_
2	valley	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	his	_	_
5	past	_	_
6	in	_	_
7	its	_	_
8	keeping	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	but	_	_
11	it	_	_
12	could	_	_
13	not	_	_
14	give	_	1:OTH
15	it	_	_
16	back	_	1
17	to	_	1
18	him	_	_
19	;	_	_
20	he	_	_
21	had	_	_
22	lost	_	_
23	the	_	_
24	master	_	_
25	word	_	_
26	that	_	_
27	might	_	_
28	have	_	_
29	compelled	_	_
30	it	_	_
31	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	asked	_	_
3	Stephen	_	_
4	fully	_	_
5	about	_	_
6	all	_	_
7	his	_	_
8	old	_	_
9	friends	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	neighbours	_	_
12	with	_	_
13	one	_	_
14	exception	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	could	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	ask	_	_
5	him	_	_
6	what	_	_
7	had	_	_
8	become	_	1:OTH
9	of	_	1
10	Joyce	_	_
11	Cameron	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	question	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	on	_	_
5	his	_	_
6	lips	_	_
7	a	_	_
8	dozen	_	_
9	times	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	but	_	_
12	he	_	_
13	shrank	_	_
14	from	_	_
15	uttering	_	_
16	it	_	_
17	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	a	_	_
4	vague	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	secret	_	_
7	dread	_	_
8	that	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	answer	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	whatever	_	_
13	it	_	_
14	might	_	_
15	be	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	would	_	_
18	hurt	_	_
19	him	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	In	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	evening	_	_
4	he	_	_
5	yielded	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	a	_	_
8	whim	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	went	_	_
11	across	_	_
12	to	_	_
13	the	_	_
14	Cameron	_	_
15	homestead	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	by	_	_
18	the	_	_
19	old	_	_
20	footpath	_	_
21	which	_	_
22	was	_	_
23	still	_	_
24	kept	_	_
25	open	_	_
26	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	walked	_	_
3	slowly	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	dreamily	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	with	_	_
8	his	_	_
9	eyes	_	_
10	on	_	_
11	the	_	_
12	far	_	_
13	hills	_	_
14	scarfed	_	_
15	in	_	_
16	the	_	_
17	splendour	_	_
18	of	_	_
19	sunset	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	walked	_	_
5	in	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	old	_	_
8	days	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	but	_	_
11	he	_	_
12	had	_	_
13	no	_	_
14	dreams	_	_
15	now	_	_
16	of	_	_
17	what	_	_
18	lay	_	_
19	beyond	_	_
20	the	_	_
21	hills	_	_
22	,	_	_
23	and	_	_
24	Joyce	_	_
25	would	_	_
26	not	_	_
27	be	_	_
28	waiting	_	_
29	among	_	_
30	the	_	_
31	firs	_	_
32	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	stile	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	remembered	_	_
5	was	_	_
6	gone	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	replaced	_	_
9	by	_	_
10	a	_	_
11	little	_	_
12	rustic	_	_
13	gate	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	As	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	passed	_	_
4	through	_	_
5	it	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	lifted	_	_
8	his	_	_
9	eyes	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	there	_	_
12	before	_	_
13	him	_	_
14	he	_	_
15	saw	_	_
16	her	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	standing	_	_
19	tall	_	_
20	and	_	_
21	gracious	_	_
22	among	_	_
23	the	_	_
24	grey	_	_
25	trees	_	_
26	,	_	_
27	with	_	_
28	the	_	_
29	light	_	_
30	from	_	_
31	the	_	_
32	west	_	_
33	falling	_	_
34	over	_	_
35	her	_	_
36	face	_	_
37	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	she	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	stood	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	so	_	_
7	she	_	_
8	had	_	_
9	looked	_	_
10	many	_	_
11	an	_	_
12	evening	_	_
13	of	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	long-ago	_	_
16	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	changed	_	_
5	;	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	realized	_	_
8	that	_	_
9	in	_	_
10	the	_	_
11	first	_	_
12	amazed	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	incredulous	_	_

1	Perhaps	_	_
2	there	_	_
3	were	_	_
4	lines	_	_
5	on	_	_
6	her	_	_

22	those	_	_

25	blue	_	_
26	eyes	_	_
27	were	_	_
28	the	_	_

31	and	_	_
32	the	_	_
