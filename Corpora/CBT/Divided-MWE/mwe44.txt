2	the	_	_

6	was	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	that	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	as	_	_
11	soon	_	_

13	Antaeus	_	_
14	was	_	_
15	fairly	_	_
16	off	_	_

29	gained	_	_
30	by	_	_

32	it	_	_
33	.	_	_

1	Hercules	_	_
2	very	_	_
3	soon	_	_
4	perceived	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	his	_	_
7	troublesome	_	_
8	enemy	_	_
9	was	_	_
10	growing	_	_
11	weaker	_	_
12	,	_	_
13	both	_	_
14	because	_	_
15	he	_	_
16	struggled	_	_

18	kicked	_	_
19	with	_	_
20	less	_	_
21	violence	_	_

23	and	_	_
24	because	_	_
25	the	_	_
26	thunder	_	_
27	of	_	_
28	his	_	_
29	big	_	_
30	voice	_	_
31	subsided	_	_
32	into	_	_
33	a	_	_
34	grumble	_	_
35	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	truth	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	unless	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	Giant	_	_
8	touched	_	_
9	Mother	_	_
10	Earth	_	_

28	breath	_	1:OTH
29	of	_	1

1	Hercules	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	guessed	_	_
4	this	_	_
5	secret	_	_
6	;	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	it	_	_
9	may	_	_
10	be	_	_
11	well	_	_
12	for	_	_
13	us	_	_
14	all	_	_
15	to	_	_

17	it	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	in	_	1:OTH
20	case	_	1
21	we	_	_

23	ever	_	_

25	to	_	2
26	fight	_	_
27	a	_	_
28	battle	_	_
29	with	_	_
30	a	_	_
31	fellow	_	_
32	like	_	_
33	Antaeus	_	_
34	.	_	_

1	For	_	_
2	these	_	_
3	earth-born	_	_
4	creatures	_	_
5	are	_	_
6	only	_	_
7	difficult	_	_
8	to	_	_

10	on	_	_
11	their	_	_
12	own	_	_
13	ground	_	_
14	,	_	_
15	but	_	_
16	may	_	_
17	easily	_	_
18	be	_	_
19	managed	_	_
20	if	_	_
21	we	_	_
22	can	_	_
23	contrive	_	_
24	to	_	_
25	lift	_	_

33	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	it	_	_
3	proved	_	_
4	with	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	poor	_	_
7	Giant	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	whom	_	_
10	I	_	_
11	am	_	_
12	really	_	_
13	a	_	_
14	little	_	_
15	sorry	_	_

18	notwithstanding	_	_
19	his	_	_

26	came	_	_
27	to	_	_
28	visit	_	_
29	him	_	_
30	.	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	his	_	_
3	strength	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	breath	_	_
6	were	_	_
7	quite	_	_
8	gone	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	Hercules	_	_
11	gave	_	_
12	his	_	_
13	huge	_	_
14	body	_	_
15	a	_	_
16	toss	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	and	_	_
19	flung	_	_
20	it	_	_
21	about	_	_
22	a	_	_
23	mile	_	_
24	off	_	_
25	,	_	_
26	where	_	_
27	it	_	_
28	fell	_	_
29	heavily	_	_
30	,	_	_
31	and	_	_
32	lay	_	_
33	with	_	_
34	no	_	1:OTH
35	more	_	1
36	motion	_	_
37	than	_	_
38	a	_	_
39	sand	_	_
40	hill	_	_
41	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	too	_	_
4	late	_	_
5	for	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	Giant	_	_
8	's	_	_
9	Mother	_	_
10	Earth	_	_
11	to	_	_
12	help	_	_
13	him	_	_
14	now	_	_
15	;	_	_
16	and	_	_
17	I	_	_
18	should	_	_
19	not	_	_
20	wonder	_	_
21	if	_	_
22	his	_	_
23	ponderous	_	_

25	were	_	_
26	lying	_	_

34	day	_	_
35	,	_	_

37	were	_	_

39	for	_	_
40	those	_	_
41	of	_	_
42	an	_	_
43	uncommonly	_	_
44	large	_	_

46	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	alas	_	_
4	me	_	_
5	!	_	_

1	What	_	_
2	a	_	_
3	wailing	_	_
4	did	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	poor	_	_
7	little	_	_

9	set	_	1:OTH

1	If	_	_

4	their	_	_

6	,	_	_
7	however	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	he	_	_
10	took	_	_
11	no	_	_

14	and	_	_
15	perhaps	_	_
16	fancied	_	_
17	them	_	_
18	only	_	_
19	the	_	_
20	shrill	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	plaintive	_	_
23	twittering	_	_
24	of	_	_

27	that	_	_

29	been	_	_
30	frightened	_	_

1	Indeed	_	_
