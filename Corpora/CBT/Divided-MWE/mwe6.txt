1	Then	_	_
2	both	_	_
3	lost	_	_
4	their	_	_
5	tempers	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	they	_	_
8	began	_	_
9	to	_	_
10	fight	_	_
11	about	_	_
12	it	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	quite	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_

41	how	_	_

45	they	_	_
46	were	_	_
47	and	_	_
48	how	_	_
49	very	_	_
50	,	_	_
51	very	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	three	_	_
3	little	_	_
4	Chucks	_	_
5	shivered	_	_
6	when	_	_
7	they	_	_

15	the	_	_

1	Then	_	_
