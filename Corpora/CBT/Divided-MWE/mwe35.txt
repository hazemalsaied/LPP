18	I	_	_

24	my	_	_
25	opinion	_	_
26	of	_	_
27	her	_	_
28	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	could	_	_

12	at	_	_

14	she	_	_
15	might	_	_
16	be	_	_
17	called	_	_
18	beautiful	_	_

1	Still	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	did	_	_

9	--	_	_
10	at	_	2:OTH

16	most	_	_
17	of	_	_
18	the	_	_

5	came	_	_
6	a	_	_
7	state	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	feeling	_	_
10	which	_	_
11	I	_	_
12	did	_	_
13	not	_	_
14	quite	_	_
15	understand	_	_
16	.	_	_

1	One	_	_
2	evening	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	went	_	_
5	to	_	_
6	prayer	_	_
7	meeting	_	_
8	with	_	_
9	Aunt	_	_
10	Lucy	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	Gussie	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	seen	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	minister	_	_
7	of	_	_
8	Ashley	_	_
9	Mills	_	_
10	before	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	though	_	_
13	Gussie	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	her	_	_
16	mother	_	_
17	seemed	_	_
18	to	_	_
19	know	_	_
20	him	_	_
21	intimately	_	_
22	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	an	_	_
4	idea	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	was	_	_
8	old	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	silvery-haired	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	benevolent-looking	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	rather	_	_
5	surprised	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	find	_	_
8	him	_	_
9	as	_	_
10	young	_	_
11	as	_	_
12	myself	_	_
13	--	_	_
14	a	_	_
15	tall	_	_

17	pale	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	intellectual-looking	_	_
20	man	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	with	_	_
23	a	_	_
24	high	_	_
25	,	_	_
26	white	_	_
27	brow	_	_
28	and	_	_
29	dark	_	_
30	,	_	_
31	earnest	_	_
32	eyes	_	_
33	--	_	_
34	decidedly	_	_
35	attractive	_	_
36	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	still	_	_
4	more	_	_
5	surprised	_	_
6	when	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	after	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	service	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	he	_	_
13	joined	_	_
14	Gussie	_	_
15	at	_	_
16	the	_	_
17	door	_	_
18	and	_	_
19	went	_	_
20	down	_	_
21	the	_	_
22	steps	_	_
23	with	_	_
24	her	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	felt	_	_
3	distinctly	_	_
4	ill-treated	_	_
5	as	_	_
6	I	_	_
7	fell	_	_
8	back	_	_
9	with	_	_
10	Aunt	_	_
11	Lucy	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	There	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	no	_	_
4	reason	_	_
5	why	_	_
6	I	_	_
7	should	_	_
8	--	_	_
9	none	_	_

20	I	_	_
21	can	_	_

46	was	_	_
47	but	_	_
48	turned	_	_
49	of	_	_
50	fifty	_	_

52	a	_	_
53	handsome	_	_
54	woman	_	_
55	still	_	_
56	--	_	_
57	wrote	_	_
58	to	_	_
59	my	_	_
60	mother	_	_
61	that	_	_
62	she	_	_
63	must	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	went	_	_
4	joyfully	_	_
5	though	_	_
6	my	_	_
7	mother	_	_

19	save	_	_
20	me	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	my	_	_
23	father	_	_
24	,	_	_
25	Conrad	_	_
26	Montressor	_	_
27	,	_	_
28	having	_	_
29	been	_	_
30	lost	_	_
31	at	_	1:OTH
32	sea	_	1
33	when	_	_
34	but	_	_
35	three	_	_
36	months	_	_
37	wed.	_	_
38	.	_	_

1	My	_	_
2	aunts	_	_
3	were	_	_
4	wont	_	_
5	to	_	_
6	tell	_	_
7	me	_	_
8	how	_	_
9	much	_	_
10	I	_	_
11	resembled	_	_
12	him	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	being	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	so	_	_
17	they	_	_
18	said	_	_
19	,	_	_
20	a	_	_
21	Montressor	_	_
22	to	_	_
23	the	_	_
24	backbone	_	_
25	;	_	_
26	and	_	_
27	this	_	_
28	I	_	_
29	took	_	_
30	to	_	_
31	mean	_	_
32	commendation	_	_
33	,	_	_
34	for	_	_
35	the	_	_
36	Montressors	_	_
37	were	_	_
38	a	_	_
39	well-descended	_	_
40	and	_	_
41	well-thought-of	_	_
42	family	_	_
43	,	_	_
44	and	_	_
45	the	_	_
46	women	_	_
47	were	_	_
48	noted	_	_
49	for	_	_
50	their	_	_
51	beauty	_	_
52	.	_	_

1	This	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	could	_	_
4	well	_	_
5	believe	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	since	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	all	_	_
10	my	_	_
11	aunts	_	_
12	there	_	_
13	was	_	_
14	not	_	_
15	one	_	_
16	but	_	_
17	was	_	_
18	counted	_	_
19	a	_	_
20	pretty	_	_
21	woman	_	_
22	.	_	_

1	Therefore	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	took	_	_
4	heart	_	_
5	of	_	_
6	grace	_	_
7	when	_	_
8	I	_	_
9	thought	_	_
10	of	_	_
11	my	_	_
12	dark	_	_
13	face	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	spindling	_	_
16	shape	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	hoping	_	_
19	that	_	_
20	when	_	_
21	I	_	_
22	should	_	_
23	be	_	_
24	grown	_	_
25	up	_	_
26	I	_	_
27	might	_	_
28	be	_	_
29	counted	_	_
30	not	_	_
31	unworthy	_	_
32	of	_	_
33	my	_	_
34	race	_	_
35	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	Place	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	an	_	_
5	old-fashioned	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	mysterious	_	_
8	house	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	such	_	_
11	as	_	_
12	I	_	_
13	delighted	_	_
14	in	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	and	_	_
17	Mrs.	_	_
18	Montressor	_	_
19	was	_	_
20	ever	_	_

23	me	_	_
24	,	_	_
25	albeit	_	_
26	a	_	_
27	little	_	_
28	stern	_	_
29	,	_	_
30	for	_	_
31	she	_	_
32	was	_	_
33	a	_	_
34	proud	_	_
35	woman	_	_
36	and	_	_
37	cared	_	_
38	but	_	_
39	little	_	_
40	for	_	_
41	children	_	_

89	a	_	_
90	thing	_	_
91	to	_	_
92	dazzle	_	_
93	the	_	_
94	day	_	_
95	and	_	_
96	that	_	_
97	she	_	_
98	was	_	_
99	of	_	_
100	some	_	_
101	strange	_	_
102	alien	_	_
103	blood	_	_
104	such	_	_

112	of	_	_
113	the	_	_
114	Montressors	_	_
115	.	_	_

1	Some	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	much	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	say	_	_
6	of	_	_
7	her	_	_
8	pride	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	insolence	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	wondered	_	_
14	if	_	_
15	Mrs.	_	_
16	Montressor	_	_
17	would	_	_
18	tamely	_	_
19	yield	_	_
20	her	_	_
21	mistress-ship	_	_
22	to	_	_
23	the	_	_
24	stranger	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	others	_	_
3	,	_	_
4	who	_	_
5	were	_	_
6	taken	_	_
7	with	_	_
8	her	_	_
9	loveliness	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	grace	_	_
12	,	_	_
13	said	_	_
14	that	_	_
15	the	_	_
16	tales	_	_
17	told	_	_
18	were	_	_
19	born	_	_
20	of	_	_
21	envy	_	_
22	and	_	_
23	malice	_	_
24	,	_	_
25	and	_	_
26	that	_	_
27	Alicia	_	_
28	Montressor	_	_
29	was	_	_
30	well	_	_
31	worthy	_	_

36	station	_	_
37	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	halted	_	_
4	between	_	_
5	two	_	_
6	opinions	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	thought	_	_
9	to	_	_
10	judge	_	_
11	for	_	_
12	myself	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	but	_	_
15	when	_	_
16	I	_	_
17	went	_	_
18	to	_	_

28	gone	_	_
29	for	_	_
30	a	_	_
31	time	_	_
32	,	_	_
33	and	_	_
34	I	_	_
35	had	_	_
36	even	_	_
37	to	_	_
38	swallow	_	_
39	my	_	_
40	disappointment	_	_
41	and	_	_
42	bide	_	_
43	their	_	_

46	all	_	_
47	my	_	_
48	small	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	my	_	_
3	aunts	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	their	_	_
6	stepmother	_	_
7	talked	_	_
8	much	_	_
9	of	_	_
10	Alicia	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	they	_	_
14	spoke	_	_
15	slightingly	_	_
16	of	_	_
17	her	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	saying	_	_
20	that	_	_
21	she	_	_
22	was	_	_
23	but	_	_
24	a	_	_
25	light	_	_
26	woman	_	_
27	and	_	_
28	that	_	_
29	no	_	3:OTH
30	good	_	3
31	would	_	_
32	come	_	1:OTH;1:OTH;2:OTH
33	of	_	2
34	my	_	_
35	Uncle	_	_
36	Hugh	_	_

38	having	_	_
39	wed	_	_

49	.	_	_

1	Also	_	_
2	they	_	_
3	spoke	_	_
4	of	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	company	_	_
7	she	_	_
8	gathered	_	_
9	around	_	_

11	,	_	_
12	thinking	_	_

1	All	_	_
2	this	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	heard	_	_

6	pondered	_	_
7	much	_	_

10	although	_	_

29	and	_	_
30	we	_	_
31	were	_	_
32	all	_	_
33	assembled	_	_
34	to	_	_
35	meet	_	_

42	where	_	_
43	a	_	_
44	ruddy	_	_
45	firelight	_	_
46	was	_	_
47	gleaming	_	_
48	.	_	_

1	My	_	_
2	Aunt	_	_
3	Frances	_	_
4	had	_	_

14	crimson	_	_
15	sash	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	with	_	_
18	much	_	_
19	lamenting	_	_
20	over	_	_
21	my	_	_
22	skinny	_	_
23	neck	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	slipped	_	_
4	in	_	_
5	a	_	_
6	corner	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	my	_	_

12	cold	_	_
13	with	_	_
14	excitement	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	for	_	_
17	I	_	_

31	,	_	_
32	and	_	_
33	my	_	_
34	heart	_	_
35	beat	_	_
36	so	_	_
37	hardly	_	_
38	that	_	_
39	it	_	_
40	even	_	_
41	pained	_	_
42	me	_	_
43	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	door	_	_
4	opened	_	_

6	Alicia	_	_

31	a	_	_
32	little	_	_
33	disdainfully	_	_

35	it	_	_

1	After	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	my	_	_
3	Uncle	_	_

6	there	_	_
7	often	_	_

10	he	_	_
11	would	_	_

13	her	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	praise	_	_
16	her	_	_
17	loveliness	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	not	_	_
20	heeding	_	_

1	Yet	_	_
2	it	_	_
3	ever	_	_

7	that	_	_
8	she	_	_

27	luridly	_	_
28	that	_	_
29	a	_	_
30	chill	_	_
31	dread	_	_
32	would	_	_

34	over	_	2
35	me	_	_
36	,	_	_
37	and	_	_
38	I	_	_
39	would	_	_

42	my	_	_
43	Aunt	_	_
44	Elizabeth	_	_

12	then	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	she	_	_

4	him	_	_

1	When	_	_

4	rightly	_	_
5	to	_	_
6	my	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	told	_	_

6	best	_	_
7	I	_	_
8	could	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	though	_	_

12	aggrieved	_	_
13	that	_	_
14	to	_	_
15	my	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	my	_	_
3	mother	_	_
4	,	_	_
5	sorely	_	_
6	vexed	_	_
7	over	_	_

10	--	_	_
11	which	_	_
12	in	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	many	_	_
4	years	_	_
