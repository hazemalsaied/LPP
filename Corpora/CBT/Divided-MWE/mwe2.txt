13	a	_	_
14	young	_	_
15	man	_	_
16	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	lounging	_	_
4	on	_	_
5	a	_	_
6	rock	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	looking	_	_
9	dreamily	_	_
10	out	_	_
11	to	_	1:OTH

13	.	_	_

1	There	_	_

3	something	_	_
4	about	_	_
5	his	_	_
6	face	_	_
7	that	_	_
8	reminded	_	_
9	me	_	_
10	of	_	_
11	someone	_	_
12	I	_	_
13	know	_	_

15	but	_	_
16	I	_	_
17	can	_	_
18	not	_	_

6	on	_	1:OTH
7	the	_	1
8	same	_	_

10	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	seems	_	_
3	to	_	_

5	a	_	_
6	solitary	_	_
7	individual	_	_
8	,	_	_

11	prowling	_	_
12	by	_	_
13	himself	_	_

1	I	_	_

11	I	_	_
12	am	_	_
13	afraid	_	_

1	This	_	_
2	morning	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	turned	_	_
5	my	_	_
6	glass	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	as	_	_
9	usual	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	on	_	_
12	his	_	_
13	pet	_	_
14	haunt	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	nearly	_	_
3	fell	_	_
4	over	_	_
5	in	_	_
6	my	_	_
7	astonishment	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	for	_	_
10	he	_	_
11	was	_	_
12	also	_	_
13	looking	_	_
14	through	_	_
15	a	_	_
16	spyglass	_	_
17	straight	_	_
18	at	_	_
19	me	_	_
20	,	_	_
21	too	_	_
22	,	_	_
23	it	_	_
24	seemed	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	How	_	_
2	foolish	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	felt	_	_
5	!	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	yet	_	_
3	my	_	_
4	curiosity	_	_
5	was	_	_
6	so	_	_
7	strong	_	_
8	that	_	_
9	a	_	1:OTH
10	few	_	1
11	minutes	_	_
12	afterward	_	_
13	I	_	_
14	peeped	_	_
15	back	_	_
16	again	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	just	_	_
19	to	_	_
20	see	_	_
21	what	_	_
22	he	_	_
23	was	_	_
24	doing	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	coolly	_	_
4	laid	_	_
5	down	_	_
6	his	_	_
7	glass	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	rose	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	lifted	_	_
12	his	_	_
13	cap	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	bowed	_	_
16	politely	_	_
17	to	_	_
18	me	_	_
19	--	_	_
20	or	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	at	_	1:OTH
23	least	_	1
24	,	_	_
25	in	_	_
26	my	_	_
27	direction	_	_
28	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	dropped	_	_
3	my	_	_
4	glass	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	smiled	_	_
7	in	_	_
8	a	_	_
9	mixture	_	_
10	of	_	_
11	dismay	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	amusement	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	remembered	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	he	_	_
6	was	_	_
7	probably	_	_
8	watching	_	_
9	me	_	_
10	again	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	might	_	_
14	imagine	_	_
15	my	_	_
16	smile	_	_
17	was	_	_
18	meant	_	_
19	for	_	_
20	him	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	banished	_	_
3	it	_	_
4	immediately	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	shut	_	_
7	my	_	_
8	glass	_	_
9	up	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	did	_	_
12	not	_	_
13	touch	_	_
14	it	_	_
15	again	_	_
16	.	_	_

1	Soon	_	_
2	after	_	_
3	we	_	_
4	came	_	_

1	Today	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	went	_	_
4	to	_	_

7	as	_	_
8	usual	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	fully	_	_
11	resolved	_	_
12	not	_	_
13	even	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	in	_	1:OTH

8	take	_	_
9	a	_	_
10	peep	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	saw	_	_
14	him	_	_
15	on	_	_
16	the	_	_
17	rocks	_	_

23	me	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	saw	_	_

14	held	_	_
15	up	_	_
16	his	_	_

1	We	_	_

3	to	_	_
4	hurry	_	_
5	to	_	_
6	fix	_	_
7	the	_	_

9	if	_	_
10	we	_	_
11	wanted	_	_

15	up	_	_
16	before	_	_
17	the	_	_
18	wind	_	_
19	fell	_	_
20	,	_	_
21	so	_	_
22	we	_	_
23	rushed	_	_
24	into	_	_
25	the	_	_
26	lighthouse	_	_
27	to	_	_
28	get	_	_
29	some	_	_

19	anyhow	_	_
20	,	_	_
21	so	_	_
22	we	_	_
23	just	_	_
24	took	_	_
25	the	_	_
26	first	_	_
27	thing	_	_
28	that	_	_
29	came	_	_
30	handy	_	_

32	an	_	_

17	it	_	_

30	away	_	_

32	the	_	_
33	mainland	_	_
34	to	_	_
35	buy	_	_

39	we	_	_
40	never	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	one	_	_
4	Father	_	_
5	had	_	_
6	taken	_	_
7	from	_	_
8	a	_	_

10	in	_	_
11	the	_	_

17	out	_	_
18	the	_	_
19	night	_	_
20	before	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	We	_	_
2	patched	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	kite	_	_
5	up	_	_
6	with	_	_
7	the	_	_

17	dried	_	_
18	it	_	_
19	by	_	_
20	the	_	_

22	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	we	_	_

6	and	_	_
7	up	_	_
8	went	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	kite	_	_
11	like	_	1:OTH
12	a	_	1

14	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	wind	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	glorious	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	it	_	_
8	soared	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	strained	_	_
11	like	_	_
12	something	_	_
13	alive	_	_

1	All	_	_

12	in	_	_

21	flatfish	_	_
22	,	_	_
23	and	_	_
24	our	_	_

26	sailing	_	_
27	along	_	_
28	at	_	_
29	a	_	_

34	over	_	_
35	to	_	_
36	the	_	_

38	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	might	_	_

4	said	_	_
5	to	_	_
6	Claude	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	So	_	_
9	like	_	_
10	a	_	_

12	!	_	_

1	but	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	did	_	_
4	n't	_	_
5	.	_	_

1	Instead	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	sympathized	_	_
5	with	_	_
6	him	_	_
7	,	_	_

9	pointed	_	_
10	out	_	_
11	that	_	_
12	it	_	_
13	really	_	_
14	did	_	_
15	n't	_	_

18	I	_	_
19	had	_	_
20	spoiled	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	most	_	_
5	amazing	_	_
6	thing	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	It	_	_

6	young	_	_
7	man	_	_

42	gone	_	_
43	away	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	never	_	_
3	went	_	_
4	back	_	_

6	and	_	_
7	he	_	_
8	never	_	_

1	Father	_	_
2	says	_	_
3	that	_	_
4	this	_	_
5	was	_	_
6	very	_	_
7	wrong	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	him	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	I	_	_
13	suppose	_	_
14	it	_	_
15	was	_	_

17	since	_	_

19	says	_	_

23	I	_	_
24	do	_	_
25	n't	_	_

1	Anyway	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	he	_	_

5	a	_	_
6	sister	_	_
7	Esther	_	_

9	he	_	_
10	loved	_	_
11	very	_	_
12	much	_	_
13	;	_	_

15	he	_	_

17	bitter	_	_
18	against	_	_
19	her	_	_
20	too	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	because	_	_
23	he	_	_
24	thought	_	_
25	she	_	_
26	took	_	_
27	his	_	_
28	brother	_	_
29	's	_	_
30	part	_	_
31	too	_	_
32	much	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	though	_	_
4	a	_	_
5	letter	_	_
6	of	_	_

19	he	_	_
20	never	_	_

25	he	_	_
26	never	_	_

28	anything	_	_
29	more	_	_
30	.	_	_

1	Years	_	_
2	afterward	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	felt	_	_
5	sorry	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	went	_	_
8	back	_	_
9	,	_	_
