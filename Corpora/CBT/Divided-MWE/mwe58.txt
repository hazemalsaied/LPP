10	the	_	_

12	sides	_	_
13	without	_	_
14	looking	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	as	_	_
17	Grandfather	_	_
18	Frog	_	_
19	did	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	now	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	carefully	_	_
5	picked	_	_
6	out	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	trees	_	_
9	to	_	_
10	cut	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	could	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	afford	_	_
5	to	_	_
6	waste	_	_
7	time	_	_
8	cutting	_	_
9	down	_	_
10	a	_	_
11	tree	_	_
12	that	_	_
13	was	_	_
14	n't	_	_
15	going	_	_
16	to	_	_
17	be	_	_
18	just	_	_
19	what	_	_
20	he	_	_
21	wanted	_	_
22	when	_	_
23	it	_	_
24	was	_	_
25	down	_	_
26	.	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	sure	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	tree	_	_
8	was	_	_
9	right	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	he	_	_
12	looked	_	_
13	up	_	_
14	at	_	_
15	the	_	_
16	top	_	_
17	to	_	_
18	find	_	1:OTH
19	out	_	1
20	whether	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	when	_	_
23	he	_	_
24	had	_	_
25	cut	_	_
26	it	_	_
27	,	_	_
28	it	_	_
29	would	_	_
30	fall	_	_
31	clear	_	2:OTH
32	of	_	2
33	other	_	_
34	trees	_	_
35	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	learned	_	_
4	to	_	1:OTH
5	do	_	1
6	that	_	_
7	when	_	_
8	he	_	_
9	was	_	_
10	quite	_	_
11	young	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	heedless	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	remembered	_	_
3	just	_	_
4	how	_	_
5	he	_	_
6	had	_	_
7	felt	_	_
8	when	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	after	_	_
11	working	_	_
12	hard	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	oh	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	so	_	_
17	hard	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	to	_	_
20	cut	_	_
21	a	_	_
22	big	_	2:OTH
23	tree	_	2
24	,	_	_
25	he	_	_
26	had	_	_
27	warned	_	_
28	all	_	_
29	his	_	_
30	friends	_	_
31	to	_	_
32	get	_	1:OTH;5:OTH;6:OTH
33	out	_	1;3:OTH;4:OTH;5;6
34	of	_	1;3;4;6
35	the	_	1;3
36	way	_	1;3
37	so	_	_
38	that	_	_
39	they	_	_
40	would	_	_
41	not	_	_
42	be	_	_
43	hurt	_	_
44	when	_	_
45	it	_	_
46	fell	_	_
47	,	_	_
48	and	_	_
49	then	_	_
50	it	_	_
51	had	_	_
52	n't	_	_
53	fallen	_	_
54	at	_	7:OTH
55	all	_	7
56	because	_	_
57	the	_	_
58	top	_	_
59	had	_	_
60	caught	_	_
61	in	_	_
62	another	_	_
63	tree	_	_
64	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	so	_	_
4	mortified	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	did	_	_
8	n't	_	_
9	get	_	1:OTH
10	over	_	1
11	it	_	_
12	for	_	_
13	a	_	_
14	long	_	_
15	time	_	_
16	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	now	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	made	_	_
5	sure	_	_
6	that	_	_
7	a	_	_
8	tree	_	_
9	was	_	_
10	going	_	_
11	to	_	_
12	fall	_	_
13	clear	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	just	_	_
16	where	_	_
17	he	_	_
18	wanted	_	_
19	it	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	sat	_	_
4	up	_	_
5	on	_	_
6	his	_	_
7	hind	_	_
8	legs	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	with	_	_
12	his	_	_
13	great	_	_
14	broad	_	_
15	tail	_	_
16	for	_	_
17	a	_	_
18	brace	_	_
19	,	_	_
20	began	_	_
21	to	_	_
22	make	_	_
23	the	_	_
24	chips	_	_
25	fly	_	_
26	.	_	_

1	You	_	_
2	know	_	_
3	Paddy	_	_
4	has	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	most	_	_
7	wonderful	_	_
8	teeth	_	_
9	for	_	_
10	cutting	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	They	_	_
2	are	_	_
3	long	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	broad	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	sharp	_	_
8	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	would	_	_
3	begin	_	_
4	by	_	_
5	making	_	_
6	a	_	_
7	deep	_	1:OTH
8	bite	_	1
9	,	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	then	_	_
12	another	_	_
13	just	_	_
14	a	_	_
15	little	_	_
16	way	_	_
17	below	_	_
18	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	would	_	_
4	pry	_	_
5	out	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	little	_	_
8	piece	_	_
9	of	_	_
10	wood	_	_
11	between	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	cut	_	_
5	very	_	_
6	deep	_	_
7	on	_	_
8	one	_	_
9	side	_	_
10	so	_	2:OTH
11	that	_	2
12	the	_	_
13	tree	_	_
14	would	_	_
15	fall	_	_
16	that	_	_
17	way	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	he	_	_
20	would	_	_
21	work	_	1:OTH
22	around	_	1
23	to	_	1
24	the	_	_
25	other	_	_
26	side	_	_
27	.	_	_

1	Just	_	_
2	as	_	_
3	soon	_	_
4	as	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	tree	_	_
7	began	_	_
8	to	_	_
9	lean	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	he	_	_
12	was	_	_
13	sure	_	_
14	that	_	_
15	it	_	_
16	was	_	_
17	going	_	_
18	to	_	_
19	fall	_	_
20	,	_	_
21	he	_	_
22	would	_	_
23	scamper	_	_
24	away	_	_
25	so	_	_
26	as	_	_
27	to	_	_
28	be	_	1:OTH;3:OTH
29	out	_	1;2:OTH;3
30	of	_	2;3
31	danger	_	_
32	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	loved	_	_
3	to	_	_
4	see	_	_
5	those	_	_
6	tall	_	_
7	trees	_	_
8	lean	_	_
9	forward	_	_
10	slowly	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	then	_	_
13	faster	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	faster	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	till	_	_
18	they	_	_
19	struck	_	_
20	the	_	_
21	ground	_	_
22	with	_	_
23	a	_	_
24	crash	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	Just	_	_
2	as	_	_
3	soon	_	_
4	as	_	_
5	they	_	_
6	were	_	_
7	down	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	he	_	_
10	would	_	_
11	trim	_	1:OTH
12	off	_	1
13	the	_	_
14	branches	_	_
15	until	_	_
16	the	_	_

19	just	_	_
20	long	_	_
21	poles	_	_
22	.	_	_

1	This	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	easy	_	_
4	work	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	for	_	_
7	he	_	_
8	could	_	_
9	take	_	1:OTH
10	off	_	1
11	a	_	_
12	good-sized	_	_

14	with	_	_
15	one	_	_
16	bite	_	_
17	.	_	_

1	On	_	_
2	many	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	left	_	_
5	their	_	_
6	bushy	_	_
7	tops	_	_
8	.	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	he	_	_

5	them	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	suit	_	_
8	him	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	had	_	_
11	cut	_	_
12	them	_	_
13	into	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	right	_	_
16	lengths	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	he	_	_
19	would	_	_
20	tug	_	_
21	and	_	_
22	pull	_	_
23	them	_	_
24	down	_	_
25	to	_	_
26	the	_	_
27	place	_	_

29	he	_	_

1	There	_	_

30	which	_	_

2	keep	_	_
3	them	_	_
4	from	_	_
5	floating	_	_
6	away	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	he	_	_

1	Clear	_	_
2	across	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	dragged	_	_
4	more	_	_

1	Paddy	_	_
2	the	_	_

5	perfectly	_	_
6	well	_	_
7	that	_	_

1	He	_	_

1	You	_	_
2	see	_	_
3	he	_	_

1	Jerry	_	_

3	a	_	_
4	house-builder	_	_
5	himself	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	down	_	_
9	deep	_	_
10	in	_	_
11	his	_	_
12	heart	_	_
13	he	_	_
14	very	_	_
15	much	_	_
16	doubted	_	_
17	if	_	_
18	Paddy	_	_
19	could	_	_

1	His	_	_
2	house	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	down	_	_
5	in	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	Smiling	_	_
8	Pool	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	Jerry	_	_
12	thought	_	_
13	it	_	_
14	a	_	_
15	very	_	_
16	wonderful	_	_
17	house	_	_
18	indeed	_	_
19	,	_	_
20	and	_	_
21	was	_	_
22	very	_	_
23	proud	_	_
24	of	_	1:OTH
25	it	_	1
26	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	built	_	_
4	of	_	_
5	mud	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	sod	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	little	_	_
10	alder	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	willow	_	_
13	twigs	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	bulrushes	_	_
16	.	_	_

1	Jerry	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	spent	_	_
4	one	_	_
5	winter	_	_
6	in	_	_
7	it	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	he	_	_
11	had	_	_
12	decided	_	_
13	to	_	_
14	spend	_	_
15	another	_	_
16	there	_	_
17	after	_	_
18	he	_	_
19	had	_	_
20	fixed	_	_
21	it	_	_
22	up	_	_
23	a	_	_
24	little	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	as	_	_
4	long	_	_
5	as	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	did	_	_
8	n't	_	_
9	have	_	1:OTH
10	to	_	1
11	build	_	_
12	a	_	_
13	brand-new	_	_
14	house	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	he	_	_
17	could	_	_
18	afford	_	_
19	the	_	_
20	time	_	_
21	to	_	_
22	watch	_	_
23	his	_	_
24	cousin	_	_
25	Paddy	_	_
26	.	_	_

1	Perhaps	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	hoped	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	Paddy	_	_
6	would	_	_
7	ask	_	_
8	his	_	_
9	advice	_	_
10	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	Paddy	_	_
3	did	_	_
4	nothing	_	1:OTH
5	of	_	1
6	the	_	1
7	kind	_	1
8	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	seen	_	_
4	Jerry	_	_
5	Muskrat	_	_
6	's	_	_
7	house	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	he	_	_
11	had	_	_
12	smiled	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	taken	_	_
5	great	_	_
6	pains	_	_
7	not	_	_
8	to	_	_
9	let	_	_
10	Jerry	_	_
11	see	_	_
12	that	_	_
13	smile	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	would	_	_
3	n't	_	_
4	have	_	_
5	hurt	_	_
6	Jerry	_	_
7	's	_	_
8	feelings	_	_
9	for	_	1:OTH
10	the	_	1
11	world	_	1
12	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	is	_	_
3	too	_	_
4	polite	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	good-natured	_	_
7	to	_	1:OTH
8	do	_	1
9	anything	_	2:OTH
10	like	_	2
11	that	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	Jerry	_	_
3	sat	_	_
4	on	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	end	_	_
7	of	_	_
8	an	_	_

11	and	_	_
12	watched	_	_
13	Paddy	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	first	_	_
3	thing	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	build	_	_
6	was	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	foundation	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	This	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	of	_	_
4	mud	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	grass	_	_
7	with	_	_
8	sticks	_	_
9	worked	_	_
10	into	_	_
11	it	_	_
12	to	_	_
13	hold	_	1:OTH
14	it	_	1
15	together	_	_

1	Paddy	_	_

7	bottom	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	his	_	_
10	new	_	_
11	pond	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	because	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	pond	_	_
5	was	_	_
6	new	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	there	_	_
9	was	_	_
10	a	_	_
11	great	_	1:OTH
12	deal	_	1
13	of	_	_
14	grassy	_	_
15	sod	_	_
16	there	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	which	_	_
19	was	_	_
20	just	_	_
21	what	_	_
22	Paddy	_	_
23	needed	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	very	_	_
4	convenient	_	_
5	.	_	_

1	Jerry	_	_
2	watched	_	_
3	a	_	_
4	little	_	_
5	while	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	then	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	because	_	_
10	Jerry	_	_
11	is	_	_
12	a	_	_
13	worker	_	_
14	himself	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	he	_	_
17	just	_	_
18	had	_	_
19	to	_	_
20	get	_	1:OTH
21	busy	_	1
22	and	_	_
23	help	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	Rather	_	_
2	timidly	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	told	_	_
5	his	_	_
6	big	_	_
7	cousin	_	_
8	that	_	_
9	he	_	_
10	would	_	_
11	like	_	_
12	to	_	_
13	have	_	_
14	a	_	_
15	share	_	_
16	in	_	_
17	building	_	_
18	the	_	_
19	new	_	_
20	house	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	``	_	_
2	All	_	_
3	right	_	_
4	,	_	_
5	''	_	_
6	replied	_	_
7	Paddy	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	``	_	_
10	that	_	_
11	will	_	_
12	be	_	_
13	fine	_	_

1	You	_	_
2	can	_	_
3	bring	_	_
4	mud	_	_
5	while	_	_
6	I	_	_
7	am	_	_
8	getting	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	sticks	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	grass	_	_
13	.	_	_
14	''	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	Jerry	_	_
3	dived	_	_
4	down	_	_
5	to	_	1:OTH
6	the	_	1
7	bottom	_	1
8	of	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	pond	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	dug	_	_
13	up	_	_
14	mud	_	_
15	and	_	_
16	piled	_	_
17	it	_	_
18	on	_	_
19	the	_	_
20	foundation	_	_
21	and	_	_
22	was	_	_
23	happy	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	little	_	_
3	stars	_	_
4	looked	_	_
5	down	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	twinkled	_	_
8	merrily	_	_
9	as	_	_
10	they	_	_
11	watched	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	two	_	_
14	workers	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	foundation	_	_
4	grew	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	grew	_	_
7	down	_	1:OTH
8	under	_	1
9	the	_	_

11	.	_	_

1	Jerry	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	very	_	_
4	much	_	_
5	surprised	_	_
6	at	_	_

1	Whenever	_	_

1	It	_	_

4	so	_	1:OTH
5	much	_	1
6	that	_	_

25	enough	_	_
26	to	_	_
27	find	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	does	_	_
4	find	_	_
5	it	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	he	_	_
8	usually	_	_
9	steals	_	_
10	it	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	it	_	_
3	is	_	_
4	the	_	_

7	hunting	_	_
8	that	_	_
9	Sammy	_	_
10	enjoys	_	_
11	most	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	now	_	_
3	Sammy	_	_
4	thoroughly	_	_
5	enjoyed	_	_
6	hunting	_	_
7	for	_	_
8	Mr.	_	_

10	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	peered	_	_
3	into	_	_
4	every	_	_
5	likely	_	_
6	hiding-place	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	became	_	_
9	so	_	_
10	interested	_	_
11	that	_	_
12	he	_	_
13	quite	_	_
14	forgot	_	_
15	about	_	_
16	the	_	_
17	hunters	_	_
18	who	_	_
19	might	_	_
20	be	_	_
21	waiting	_	_
22	along	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	it	_	_
3	happened	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	he	_	_
6	did	_	_
7	n't	_	_
