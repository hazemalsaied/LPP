1	Of	_	_
2	course	_	_
3	,	_	_
4	being	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	of	_	1:OTH

5	,	_	_
6	he	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	instead	_	1:OTH

8	Reddy	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	he	_	_
11	had	_	_
12	openly	_	_
13	rejoiced	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	seems	_	_
3	to	_	_
4	be	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	Sammy	_	_

6	made	_	_
7	fun	_	_

1	In	_	_

11	Sammy	_	_
12	dearly	_	_
13	loves	_	_
14	excitement	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	then	_	_
3	it	_	_
4	would	_	_
5	make	_	_
6	such	_	1:OTH
7	a	_	1
8	splendid	_	_
9	story	_	_
10	to	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	Lightfoot	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	known	_	_

6	hunters	_	_
7	hiding	_	_

1	That	_	_

6	a	_	_

10	an	_	_
11	unfair	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	hunters	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	done	_	_
5	it	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	knew	_	_
3	that	_	_
4	if	_	_
5	any	_	_
6	hunters	_	_
7	were	_	_
8	hidden	_	_
9	there	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	the	_	_
12	Merry	_	_
13	Little	_	_
14	Breezes	_	_
15	would	_	_
16	bring	_	_
17	him	_	_
18	their	_	_

20	and	_	_
21	thus	_	_
22	warn	_	_
23	him	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	almost	_	_
4	reached	_	_
5	the	_	1:OTH

16	there	_	_
17	came	_	_
18	a	_	_
19	sudden	_	_
20	crash	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	startled	_	_
3	Lightfoot	_	_
4	terribly	_	_
5	for	_	_
6	just	_	_
7	an	_	_
8	instant	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	guessed	_	_
4	what	_	_
5	it	_	_
6	meant	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	That	_	_
2	crash	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	falling	_	_

8	tree	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	There	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	n't	_	_
4	enough	_	_

1	There	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	been	_	_
4	no	_	_

10	he	_	_

14	not	_	_
15	have	_	_

17	chopped	_	_
18	down	_	_

8	had	_	_

1	When	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	there	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	now	_	_
3	,	_	_

10	was	_	_

1	He	_	_

20	that	_	_

1	Those	_	_
2	two	_	_

1	He	_	_

11	the	_	_

16	filled	_	_
17	Lightfoot	_	_
18	with	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	watched	_	_
3	the	_	_

5	walk	_	_
6	along	_	_
7	the	_	_

10	disappear	_	_
11	in	_	_

1	Presently	_	_
2	out	_	1:OTH
3	of	_	1
4	the	_	_

11	in	_	_
12	it	_	_
13	was	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	hunter	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	headed	_	_
3	straight	_	_

5	Lightfoot	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	then	_	_
9	Lightfoot	_	_
10	knew	_	_
11	that	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	Lightfoot	_	_
3	again	_	_
4	struck	_	_

10	still	_	_

1	Slowly	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	oh	_	_
4	so	_	_
5	slowly	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	he	_	_
8	drew	_	_
