1	Peter	_	_

12	somehow	_	_
13	he	_	_
14	did	_	_
15	n't	_	_

1	You	_	_
2	see	_	_
3	those	_	_
4	briars	_	_
5	looked	_	_
6	good	_	_
7	to	_	_
8	him	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	for	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	when	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	saw	_	_
5	them	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	he	_	_
8	felt	_	_
9	almost	_	_

1	Peter	_	_
2	drew	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_

4	he	_	_

40	had	_	_
41	hunted	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	felt	_	_

15	and	_	_
16	it	_	_
17	seemed	_	_
18	as	_	_
19	if	_	_

18	had	_	_
19	to	_	_
20	watch	_	_
21	out	_	_
22	for	_	_
23	them	_	_
24	ever	_	_

26	he	_	_
27	was	_	_
28	a	_	_

37	very	_	_

40	spite	_	1
41	of	_	1
42	their	_	_
43	smartness	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	felt	_	_
3	quite	_	_
4	as	_	_
5	smart	_	1:OTH

10	a	_	_
11	little	_	2:OTH
12	bit	_	2
13	smarter	_	_

1	Anyway	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	they	_	_
4	never	_	_
5	had	_	_
6	caught	_	_
7	him	_	_

1	Of	_	_
2	course	_	_
3	it	_	_
4	was	_	_
5	quite	_	_
6	natural	_	_
