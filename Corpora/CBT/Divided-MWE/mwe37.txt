6	to	_	_
7	my	_	_
8	right	_	_
9	was	_	_
10	the	_	_
11	garden	_	_
12	,	_	_
13	and	_	_
14	before	_	_
15	me	_	_

4	the	_	_
5	big	_	_
6	trees	_	_
7	it	_	_
8	was	_	_
9	quite	_	_
10	dark	_	_
11	even	_	_
12	then	_	_

1	There	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	something	_	_
4	unusually	_	_
5	still	_	_
6	in	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	evening	_	_
9	...	_	_
10	a	_	_
11	stillness	_	_
12	as	_	_
13	of	_	_
14	waiting	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	set	_	_
3	me	_	_
4	thinking	_	_
5	of	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	last	_	_
8	time	_	_
9	Mr.	_	_
10	Lawrence	_	_

1	One	_	_
2	night	_	_
3	during	_	_
4	his	_	_
5	convalescence	_	_
6	I	_	_
7	had	_	_
8	watched	_	_

10	him	_	_
11	to	_	_
12	relieve	_	_
13	the	_	_
14	nurse	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	been	_	_
4	sleepless	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	talkative	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	telling	_	_

11	things	_	_
12	about	_	_
13	his	_	_
14	life	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	Finally	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	told	_	_
4	me	_	_
5	of	_	_
6	Margaret	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	I	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	sent	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	book	_	_
6	that	_	_
7	was	_	_
8	my	_	_
9	mother	_	_
10	's	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	read	_	_
3	it	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	loved	_	_
6	it	_	_
7	--	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	faded	_	_
10	rose-leaves	_	_
11	she	_	_
12	placed	_	_
13	in	_	_
14	it	_	_
15	are	_	_
16	there	_	_
17	still	_	_

1	At	_	_
2	first	_	_
3	,	_	_
4	dear	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	I	_	_
7	almost	_	_
8	feared	_	_
9	to	_	_
10	send	_	_
11	it	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	Would	_	_
2	you	_	_
3	miss	_	_
4	its	_	_
5	meaning	_	_
6	?	_	_

1	Would	_	_
2	you	_	_
3	laugh	_	_
4	a	_	_
5	little	_	_
6	at	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	shabby	_	_
9	volume	_	_
10	with	_	_
11	its	_	_
12	pencil	_	_
13	marks	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	its	_	_
16	rose-leaves	_	_
17	?	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	knew	_	_
4	you	_	_
5	would	_	_
6	not	_	_
7	;	_	_
8	I	_	_

6	Today	_	_
7	I	_	_
8	saw	_	_
9	you	_	_
10	with	_	_
11	the	_	_
12	child	_	_
13	of	_	_
14	your	_	_
15	sister	_	_
16	in	_	_
17	your	_	_
18	arms	_	_
19	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	felt	_	_
3	as	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	old	_	_
6	painters	_	_
7	must	_	_
8	have	_	_

11	they	_	_
12	painted	_	_
13	their	_	_
14	Madonnas	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	You	_	_
2	bent	_	_
3	over	_	_
4	his	_	_
5	shining	_	_
6	golden	_	_
7	head	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	on	_	_
11	your	_	_
12	face	_	_
13	was	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	mother	_	_
16	passion	_	_
17	and	_	_
18	tenderness	_	_
19	that	_	_
20	is	_	_

36	counterpart	_	_
37	of	_	_
38	Uncle	_	_
39	Dick	_	_

1	Instead	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	found	_	_
5	in	_	_
6	Rose	_	_
7	Lawrence	_	_
8	a	_	_
9	small	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	faded	_	_
12	woman	_	_
13	of	_	_
14	forty-five	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	gowned	_	_
17	in	_	_
18	shabby	_	_
19	black	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	evidently	_	_
4	been	_	_
5	very	_	_
6	pretty	_	_
7	once	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	but	_	_
10	bloom	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	grace	_	_
13	were	_	_
14	gone	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	Her	_	_
2	face	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	a	_	_
5	sweet	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	gentle	_	_
8	expression	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	but	_	_
11	was	_	_
12	tired	_	_
13	and	_	_
14	worn	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	and	_	_
17	her	_	_
18	fair	_	_
19	hair	_	_
20	was	_	_
21	plentifully	_	_
22	streaked	_	_
23	with	_	_
24	grey	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	Alas	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	thought	_	_
5	compassionately	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	for	_	_
8	Uncle	_	_
9	Dick	_	_
10	's	_	_
11	dreams	_	_
12	!	_	_

1	What	_	_
2	a	_	_
3	shock	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	change	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	her	_	_
8	must	_	_
9	have	_	_
10	given	_	_
11	him	_	_
12	!	_	_

1	Could	_	_
2	this	_	_
3	be	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	woman	_	_
6	on	_	_
7	whom	_	_
8	he	_	_
9	had	_	_
10	lavished	_	_
11	such	_	1:OTH
12	a	_	1
13	life-wealth	_	_
14	of	_	_
15	love	_	_
16	and	_	_
17	reverence	_	_
18	?	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	tried	_	_
3	to	_	_
4	talk	_	1:OTH
5	to	_	1
6	her	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	but	_	_
9	I	_	_
10	found	_	_
11	her	_	_
12	shy	_	_
13	and	_	_
14	timid	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	seemed	_	_
3	to	_	_
4	me	_	_
5	uninteresting	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	commonplace	_	_
8	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	this	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	Uncle	_	_
5	Dick	_	_
6	's	_	_
7	Rose	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	joy	_	_
10	!	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	so	_	_
4	sorry	_	_
5	for	_	_
6	Uncle	_	_
7	Dick	_	_
8	that	_	_
9	I	_	_
10	shrank	_	_
11	from	_	_
12	meeting	_	_
13	him	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	Nevertheless	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	went	_	_
5	over	_	_
6	after	_	_
7	tea	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	fearing	_	_
10	that	_	_
11	he	_	_
12	might	_	_
13	misunderstand	_	_
14	,	_	_
15	nay	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	rather	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	understand	_	_
20	,	_	_
21	my	_	_
22	absence	_	_
23	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	in	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	garden	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	he	_	_
9	came	_	_
10	down	_	_
11	the	_	_
12	path	_	_
13	where	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	buds	_	_
16	were	_	_
17	just	_	_
18	showing	_	_
19	.	_	_

1	There	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	a	_	_
4	smile	_	_
5	on	_	_
6	his	_	_
7	face	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	glory	_	1:OTH
11	in	_	1
12	his	_	_
13	eyes	_	_
14	was	_	_
15	quite	_	_

17	.	_	_

1	``	_	_

4	not	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	looked	_	_
3	at	_	_
4	Uncle	_	_
5	Dick	_	_
6	in	_	_
7	some	_	_
8	amazement	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	thoroughly	_	_
4	sincere	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	there	_	_
7	was	_	_
8	no	_	2:OTH

10	of	_	1

14	I	_	_
15	felt	_	_
16	a	_	_
17	great	_	_
18	throb	_	_
19	of	_	_
20	relief	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	found	_	_
4	no	_	_
5	disillusioning	_	_
6	change	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	I	_	_

5	merely	_	_
6	with	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	cold	_	_

10	of	_	_
11	the	_	_

1	He	_	_

3	her	_	_
4	through	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	transfiguring	_	_
7	medium	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	a	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	all	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	Sara	_	_
3	did	_	_
4	her	_	_
5	duty	_	_
6	unflinchingly	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	--	_	_
9	well	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	it	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	it	_	_
3	really	_	_

12	I	_	_
13	tremble	_	_

1	Perhaps	_	_
2	it	_	_
3	is	_	_
4	because	_	_
5	she	_	_

7	so	_	1:OTH
