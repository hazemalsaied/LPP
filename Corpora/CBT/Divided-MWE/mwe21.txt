1	Meanwhile	_	_
2	the	_	_

11	the	_	_
12	flowers	_	_

18	all	_	1

25	the	_	_
26	gentle	_	_
27	Fairy	_	_
28	came	_	_
29	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	to	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	stern	_	_
5	King	_	_
6	his	_	_
7	home	_	_
8	seemed	_	_
9	more	_	_
10	desolate	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	sad	_	_
13	;	_	_
14	for	_	_
15	he	_	_
16	missed	_	_
17	the	_	_
18	warm	_	_
19	light	_	_
20	,	_	_
21	the	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	wandered	_	_
4	through	_	_
5	his	_	_
6	dreary	_	_
7	palace	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	wondering	_	_
10	how	_	_
11	he	_	_
12	had	_	_
13	been	_	_
14	content	_	_
15	to	_	_
16	live	_	_
17	before	_	_
18	without	_	_
19	sunlight	_	_
20	and	_	_
21	love	_	_
22	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	little	_	_
3	Violet	_	_
4	was	_	_
5	mourned	_	_
6	as	_	_
7	dead	_	_
8	in	_	_
9	Fairy-Land	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	many	_	_
13	tears	_	_
14	were	_	_
15	shed	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	for	_	_
18	the	_	_
19	gentle	_	_
20	Fairy	_	_
21	was	_	_
22	beloved	_	_
23	by	_	_
24	all	_	_

26	from	_	_
27	the	_	_

29	down	_	_
30	to	_	_
31	the	_	_
32	humblest	_	_
33	flower	_	_
34	.	_	_

1	Sadly	_	_
2	they	_	_
3	watched	_	_
4	over	_	_
5	every	_	_
6	bird	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	blossom	_	_
9	which	_	_
10	she	_	_
11	had	_	_
12	loved	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	strove	_	_
16	to	_	_
17	be	_	_
18	like	_	_
19	her	_	_
20	in	_	_
21	kindly	_	_
22	words	_	_
23	and	_	_
24	deeds	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	They	_	_
2	wore	_	_
3	cypress	_	_
4	wreaths	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	spoke	_	_
8	of	_	_

15	never	_	_

1	Thus	_	_
2	they	_	_
3	dwelt	_	_
4	in	_	_
5	deepest	_	_
6	sorrow	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	till	_	_
