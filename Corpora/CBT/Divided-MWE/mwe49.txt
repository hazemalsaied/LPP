1	All	_	_

37	threw	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	they	_	_

8	it	_	_
9	was	_	_

11	that	_	_

1	Once	_	_

19	fluttering	_	_

24	but	_	_
25	gradually	_	_
26	I	_	_

53	a	_	_

25	still	_	_
26	no	_	_

12	now	_	_
13	redoubling	_	_

27	I	_	_
28	bent	_	_
29	my	_	_

31	in	_	1:OTH
32	that	_	1

40	while	_	_
41	it	_	_

1	The	_	_

1	This	_	_
2	brought	_	_
3	me	_	_
4	near	_	_

7	I	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	yet	_	_
3	I	_	_

6	in	_	_
7	my	_	_

9	,	_	_
10	that	_	_

1	Gradually	_	_
2	the	_	_

47	in	_	_

49	low	_	_
50	ground	_	_
51	where	_	_
52	I	_	_
53	wandered	_	_
54	I	_	_

57	among	_	_

1	Suddenly	_	_
2	a	_	_

7	about	_	_

1	I	_	_

17	Spy-glass	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	and	_	_
20	soon	_	_
21	after	_	_
22	I	_	_
23	saw	_	_
24	something	_	_
25	broad	_	_

27	silvery	_	_
28	moving	_	_
29	low	_	_
30	down	_	_

1	With	_	_
2	this	_	_
3	to	_	_

5	me	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	I	_	_
8	passed	_	_
9	rapidly	_	_
10	over	_	_
11	what	_	_
12	remained	_	_
13	to	_	_

23	sometimes	_	_
24	running	_	_
25	,	_	_

1	Yet	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	as	_	_

6	to	_	_

22	I	_	_
23	slacked	_	_

27	went	_	_

29	I	_	_
30	began	_	_

1	I	_	_

18	and	_	_
19	he	_	_
20	rubbed	_	_
21	that	_	_

7	of	_	_
8	his	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
