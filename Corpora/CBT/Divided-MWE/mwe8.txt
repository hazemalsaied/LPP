1	So	_	_
2	the	_	_

42	did	_	_
43	not	_	_

45	the	_	_
46	Terrible	_	_
47	Head	_	_

49	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	came	_	_
4	nearer	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	nearer	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	till	_	_
9	he	_	_
10	reckoned	_	_
11	that	_	_
12	he	_	_

24	he	_	_
25	guessed	_	_
26	where	_	_

28	should	_	_
29	strike	_	1:OTH
30	a	_	1
31	back	_	_

33	behind	_	_
34	him	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	drew	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	Sword	_	_
6	of	_	_
7	Sharpness	_	_
8	and	_	_

13	the	_	_

26	the	_	_

31	struck	_	_
32	him	_	_
33	like	_	_

36	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	he	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	when	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	horrible	_	_
5	creatures	_	_
6	were	_	_
7	far	_	_
8	in	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	distance	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	the	_	_
14	boy	_	_
15	found	_	_
16	himself	_	_
17	on	_	_
18	the	_	_
19	right	_	1:OTH
20	side	_	1
21	of	_	_
22	the	_	_
23	river	_	_
24	,	_	_
25	he	_	_
26	flew	_	_
27	straight	_	_
28	eastward	_	_
29	,	_	_
30	trying	_	_
31	to	_	_
32	seek	_	_
33	his	_	_

35	country	_	_
36	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	as	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	looked	_	_
5	down	_	_
6	from	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	air	_	_
9	he	_	_
10	saw	_	_
11	a	_	_
12	very	_	_
13	strange	_	_
14	sight	_	_
15	--	_	_
16	a	_	_
17	beautiful	_	_
18	girl	_	_
19	chained	_	_

28	the	_	_
29	sea	_	_
30	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	girl	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	so	_	_
5	frightened	_	_
6	or	_	1:OTH
7	so	_	1
8	tired	_	_
9	that	_	_
10	she	_	_
11	was	_	_
12	only	_	_
13	prevented	_	_
14	from	_	_
15	falling	_	_
16	by	_	_
17	the	_	_
18	iron	_	_
19	chain	_	_
20	about	_	_
21	her	_	_
22	waist	_	_
23	,	_	_
24	and	_	_
25	there	_	_
26	she	_	_
27	hung	_	_
28	,	_	_
29	as	_	_
30	if	_	_
31	she	_	_
32	were	_	_
33	dead	_	_
34	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	boy	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	very	_	_
5	sorry	_	_
6	for	_	_
7	her	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	flew	_	_
10	down	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	stood	_	_
13	beside	_	_
14	her	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	spoke	_	_
4	she	_	_
5	raised	_	_
6	her	_	_
7	head	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	looked	_	_
10	round	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	but	_	_
13	his	_	_
14	voice	_	_
15	only	_	_
16	seemed	_	_
17	to	_	_
18	frighten	_	_
19	her	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	remembered	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	he	_	_
6	was	_	_
7	wearing	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	Cap	_	_
10	of	_	_
11	Darkness	_	_
12	,	_	_
13	and	_	_
14	that	_	_
15	she	_	_
16	could	_	_
17	only	_	_
18	hear	_	_
19	him	_	_
20	,	_	_
21	not	_	_
22	see	_	_
23	him	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	took	_	_
4	it	_	_
5	off	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	there	_	_
9	he	_	_
10	stood	_	_
11	before	_	_
12	her	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	handsomest	_	_
16	young	_	_
17	man	_	_
18	she	_	_

23	all	_	1
24	her	_	_

26	,	_	_
27	with	_	_
28	short	_	_
29	curly	_	_
30	yellow	_	_
31	hair	_	_
32	,	_	_
33	and	_	_
34	blue	_	_
35	eyes	_	_
36	,	_	_
37	and	_	_
38	a	_	_
39	laughing	_	_
40	face	_	_
41	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	thought	_	_
4	her	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	most	_	_
7	beautiful	_	_
8	girl	_	_
9	in	_	1:OTH
10	the	_	1
11	world	_	1
12	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	first	_	_
3	with	_	_
4	one	_	_
5	blow	_	_
6	of	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	Sword	_	_
9	of	_	_
10	Sharpness	_	_
11	he	_	_
12	cut	_	_
13	the	_	_
14	iron	_	_
15	chain	_	_
16	that	_	_
17	bound	_	_
18	her	_	_
19	,	_	_
20	and	_	_
21	then	_	_
22	he	_	_
23	asked	_	_
24	her	_	_
25	what	_	_
26	she	_	_
27	did	_	_
28	there	_	_
29	,	_	_
30	and	_	_
31	why	_	_
32	men	_	_
33	treated	_	_
34	her	_	_
35	so	_	_
36	cruelly	_	_
37	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	she	_	_
3	told	_	_
4	him	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	she	_	_
7	was	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	daughter	_	_
10	of	_	_
11	the	_	_
12	King	_	_
13	of	_	_
14	that	_	_
15	country	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	and	_	_
18	that	_	_
19	she	_	_
20	was	_	_
21	tied	_	_
22	there	_	_
23	to	_	_
24	be	_	_
25	eaten	_	_
26	by	_	_
27	a	_	_
28	monstrous	_	_
29	beast	_	_
30	out	_	1:OTH
31	of	_	1
32	the	_	_
33	sea	_	_
34	;	_	_
35	for	_	_
36	the	_	_
37	beast	_	_
38	came	_	_
39	and	_	_
40	devoured	_	_
41	a	_	_
42	girl	_	_
43	every	_	_
44	day	_	_
45	.	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	lot	_	_
4	had	_	_
5	fallen	_	_
6	on	_	_
7	her	_	_
8	;	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	as	_	_
11	she	_	_
12	was	_	_
13	just	_	_
14	saying	_	_
15	this	_	_
16	a	_	_
17	long	_	_
18	fierce	_	_
19	head	_	_
20	of	_	_
21	a	_	_
22	cruel	_	_
23	sea	_	1:OTH
24	creature	_	1
25	rose	_	_
26	out	_	2:OTH
27	of	_	2
28	the	_	_
29	waves	_	_
30	and	_	_
31	snapped	_	_
32	at	_	_
33	the	_	_
34	girl	_	_
35	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	beast	_	_
4	had	_	_
5	been	_	_
6	too	_	_
7	greedy	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	too	_	_
10	hurried	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	so	_	_
13	he	_	_
14	missed	_	_
15	his	_	_
16	aim	_	_
17	the	_	_
18	first	_	_
19	time	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	Before	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	could	_	_
4	rise	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	bite	_	_
7	again	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	boy	_	_
10	had	_	_
11	whipped	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	Terrible	_	_
14	Head	_	_
15	out	_	1:OTH
16	of	_	1
17	his	_	_
18	wallet	_	_
19	and	_	_
20	held	_	_
21	it	_	_
22	up	_	_
23	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	when	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	sea	_	_
5	beast	_	_
6	leaped	_	_
7	out	_	_
8	once	_	_
9	more	_	_
10	its	_	_
11	eyes	_	_
12	fell	_	_
13	on	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	head	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	and	_	_
18	instantly	_	_
19	it	_	_
20	was	_	_
21	turned	_	_
22	into	_	_
23	a	_	_
24	stone	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	stone	_	_
4	beast	_	_
5	is	_	_
6	there	_	_
7	on	_	_

9	sea-coast	_	_
10	to	_	1:OTH
11	this	_	1
12	day	_	1
13	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	boy	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	girl	_	_
7	went	_	_
8	to	_	_
9	the	_	_

11	of	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	King	_	_
14	,	_	_
15	her	_	_
16	father	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	where	_	_
19	everyone	_	_

21	weeping	_	_
22	for	_	_
23	her	_	_
24	death	_	_
25	,	_	_
26	and	_	_
27	they	_	_
28	could	_	_
29	hardly	_	_
30	believe	_	_
31	their	_	_
32	eyes	_	_
33	when	_	_
34	they	_	_

37	come	_	1:OTH;2:OTH;2:OTH
38	back	_	1
39	well	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	the	_	_

4	and	_	_
5	Queen	_	_
6	made	_	_
7	much	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	boy	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	could	_	_
14	not	_	_
15	contain	_	_
16	themselves	_	_
17	for	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	the	_	_

1	The	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	all	_	1:OTH
3	the	_	1
4	people	_	_

6	,	_	_
7	because	_	_
8	the	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	they	_	_
3	asked	_	_
4	the	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	the	_	_

7	the	_	_

27	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	on	_	1:OTH
3	the	_	1

5	they	_	_

15	it	_	_

34	quoit-throwers	_	_
35	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	boy	_	_
4	would	_	_
5	try	_	_

3	without	_	1:OTH
4	saying	_	_
5	a	_	1

7	,	_	_
8	she	_	_
