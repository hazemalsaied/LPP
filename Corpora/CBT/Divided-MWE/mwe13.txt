1	Ciccu	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	embraced	_	_
4	them	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	struck	_	_
8	down	_	_
9	another	_	_

11	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	wandered	_	_

6	days	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	till	_	_
9	at	_	1:OTH

1	The	_	_
2	first	_	_

1	Next	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	locked	_	_
4	his	_	_
5	door	_	_

32	everyone	_	_
33	came	_	_
34	and	_	_
35	peeped	_	_
36	at	_	_
37	the	_	_
38	shining	_	_
39	golden	_	_

1	Lastly	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	rumour	_	_
4	of	_	_
5	these	_	_
6	wonders	_	_
7	reached	_	_
8	the	_	_

10	of	_	_
11	the	_	_
12	king	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	who	_	_
15	left	_	_
16	his	_	_
17	palace	_	_
18	to	_	_

25	eyes	_	_
26	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	Ciccu	_	_
3	received	_	_
4	him	_	_
5	with	_	_
6	all	_	_
7	respect	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	showed	_	_
11	him	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	king	_	_
4	went	_	_
5	home	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	told	_	_
8	such	_	_
9	stories	_	_
10	of	_	_
11	what	_	_
12	he	_	_
13	had	_	_

25	and	_	_
26	see	_	_
27	them	_	_
28	too	_	_
29	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	the	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	it	_	_
3	so	_	_
4	happened	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	King	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	Queen	_	_
4	was	_	_
5	very	_	_
6	much	_	_
7	ashamed	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	the	_	_

1	Perhaps	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	'll	_	_
4	be	_	_
