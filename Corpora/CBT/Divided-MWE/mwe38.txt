1	The	_	_
2	sun	_	_
3	of	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	cool	_	_
6	spring	_	_
7	evening	_	_
8	was	_	_
9	swinging	_	_
10	low	_	_
11	over	_	_
12	the	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	two	_	_
4	miles	_	_

8	,	_	_
9	but	_	_
10	half	_	_

12	there	_	_
13	Alan	_	_
14	came	_	_
15	to	_	_
16	where	_	_
17	another	_	_

28	a	_	_
29	northeasterly	_	_
30	direction	_	_
31	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	sometimes	_	_
4	wondered	_	_
5	where	_	_
6	it	_	_
7	led	_	_
8	but	_	_
9	he	_	_
10	had	_	_
11	never	_	_
12	explored	_	_

14	.	_	_

1	Now	_	_

11	turned	_	_

13	it	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	even	_	_
4	rougher	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	lonelier	_	_
7	than	_	_
8	the	_	_

10	;	_	_
11	between	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	ruts	_	_
14	the	_	_

28	again	_	_

32	broke	_	_
33	away	_	_

1	Still	_	_

3	the	_	_

7	lead	_	_
8	nowhere	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	Alan	_	_
11	was	_	_
12	half	_	_
13	repenting	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	impulse	_	_

29	the	_	_
30	shadow	_	_
31	of	_	_
32	the	_	_

34	and	_	_
35	found	_	_
36	himself	_	_
37	gazing	_	_
38	on	_	_
39	a	_	_
40	sight	_	_
41	which	_	_

1	The	_	_

1	That	_	_
2	disposed	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	decided	_	_
3	that	_	_
4	he	_	_
5	had	_	_
6	not	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	knew	_	_
3	that	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	much	_	_

1	I	_	_

3	that	_	_
4	Doctor	_	_

13	fair	_	_
14	;	_	_
15	but	_	_
16	I	_	_
17	also	_	_

4	Marcella	_	_
5	told	_	_

10	there	_	_

1	I	_	_

6	rummaged	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	went	_	_
10	to	_	_
11	work	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	piled	_	_

5	on	_	1:OTH;2:OTH
6	top	_	1;2
7	of	_	2
8	my	_	_

12	it	_	_
13	there	_	_
14	,	_	_
15	and	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	put	_	1:OTH
