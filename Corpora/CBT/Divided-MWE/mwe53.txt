27	Hooty	_	_
28	being	_	_

30	,	_	_
31	and	_	_
32	he	_	_
33	always	_	_
34	took	_	_

40	in	_	_

2	,	_	_
3	in	_	_
4	the	_	_

6	Blacky	_	_
7	was	_	_

10	all	_	1;2
11	sure	_	_
12	that	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	in	_	_
3	the	_	_

5	he	_	_

1	You	_	_
2	see	_	_
3	,	_	_
4	he	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	because	_	_

19	he	_	_
20	could	_	_

12	henhouse	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	n't	_	_
4	because	_	_

1	Presently	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	reached	_	_
4	the	_	_

7	in	_	_
8	which	_	_
9	was	_	_

5	it	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	he	_	_
8	moved	_	_

1	You	_	_

4	he	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	knew	_	_

4	the	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	Reddy	_	_
3	used	_	_

1	Lightfoot	_	_

5	enough	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	know	_	_
8	that	_	_

10	of	_	_
11	the	_	_

28	are	_	_
29	due	_	1:OTH
30	to	_	1
31	carelessness	_	_

1	No	_	_
2	one	_	_
3	who	_	_
4	is	_	_
5	hunted	_	_

8	he	_	_
9	big	_	_

18	careless	_	_
19	.	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	Lightfoot	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	known	_	_
5	of	_	_
6	hunters	_	_
7	hiding	_	_
8	near	_	_
9	water	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	hoping	_	_
12	to	_	_

16	he	_	_
17	came	_	_

1	That	_	_
2	always	_	_
3	seemed	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	Lightfoot	_	_
6	a	_	_
7	dreadful	_	_
8	thing	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	an	_	_
11	unfair	_	_
12	thing	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	hunters	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	done	_	_
5	it	_	_

8	they	_	_
9	might	_	_
10	do	_	_
11	it	_	_

13	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	Lightfoot	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	careful	_	_
5	to	_	_
6	approach	_	_
7	Paddy	_	_
8	's	_	_

10	upwind	_	_

1	That	_	_
2	is	_	_
3	,	_	_
4	he	_	_
5	approached	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	side	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	pond	_	_
11	from	_	_
12	which	_	_
13	the	_	_
14	Merry	_	_
15	Little	_	_
16	Breezes	_	_
17	were	_	_
18	blowing	_	_

20	him	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	and	_	3:OTH
23	all	_	1:OTH;2:OTH;3
24	the	_	1;2
25	time	_	2
26	he	_	_
27	kept	_	_
28	his	_	_
29	nose	_	_
30	working	_	_
31	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	knew	_	_
3	that	_	_
4	if	_	_
5	any	_	_
6	hunters	_	_
7	were	_	_
8	hidden	_	_
9	there	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	the	_	_
12	Merry	_	_
13	Little	_	_
14	Breezes	_	_
15	would	_	_
16	bring	_	_
17	him	_	_
18	their	_	_
19	scent	_	_
20	and	_	_
21	thus	_	_
22	warn	_	_
23	him	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	almost	_	_
4	reached	_	_
5	the	_	1:OTH
6	edge	_	1
7	of	_	_
8	Paddy	_	_
9	's	_	_

11	when	_	_
12	from	_	_
13	the	_	_
14	farther	_	_
15	shore	_	_
16	there	_	_
17	came	_	_
18	a	_	_
19	sudden	_	_
20	crash	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	startled	_	_
3	Lightfoot	_	_
4	terribly	_	_
5	for	_	_
6	just	_	_
7	an	_	_
8	instant	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	guessed	_	_
4	what	_	_
5	it	_	_

7	.	_	_

1	That	_	_
2	crash	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	the	_	_

9	.	_	_

1	There	_	_

3	n't	_	_
4	enough	_	_

1	There	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	been	_	_
4	no	_	_
5	sound	_	_
6	of	_	_

8	,	_	_
9	so	_	_
10	he	_	_
11	knew	_	_
12	it	_	_
13	could	_	_
14	not	_	_
15	have	_	_
16	been	_	_
17	chopped	_	_
18	down	_	_
19	by	_	_
20	men	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	must	_	_
3	be	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	Paddy	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	Beaver	_	_
8	had	_	_

10	it	_	_

1	Those	_	_
2	two	_	_

4	were	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	hounds	_	_
7	who	_	_
8	had	_	_

10	him	_	_
11	into	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	Big	_	_
14	River	_	_

1	They	_	_
2	were	_	_

6	instead	_	1:OTH
7	of	_	1

1	Presently	_	_
2	a	_	_
3	brown	_	_

5	joined	_	_
6	the	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_

8	the	_	_

10	of	_	_
11	the	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	too	_	_

5	away	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	be	_	_

11	the	_	_

15	him	_	_
16	filled	_	_
17	Lightfoot	_	_
18	with	_	_
19	terror	_	_
20	again	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	watched	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	hunter	_	_
5	walk	_	_
6	along	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	bank	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	disappear	_	_
11	in	_	_

1	Presently	_	_
2	out	_	1:OTH
3	of	_	1
4	the	_	_
5	bushes	_	_
6	came	_	_
7	a	_	_

9	,	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	in	_	_
12	it	_	_
13	was	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	hunter	_	_
16	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	headed	_	_
3	straight	_	_
4	towards	_	_
5	Lightfoot	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	then	_	_
9	Lightfoot	_	_
10	knew	_	_
11	that	_	_
12	his	_	_
13	brief	_	_

15	was	_	_
16	at	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	must	_	_

15	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	Lightfoot	_	_
3	again	_	_
4	struck	_	_
5	out	_	1:OTH

7	the	_	_

1	His	_	_

9	but	_	_
10	still	_	_
11	he	_	_
12	was	_	_
13	very	_	_
14	,	_	_
15	very	_	_

1	Slowly	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	oh	_	_
4	so	_	_
5	slowly	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	he	_	_
8	drew	_	_
9	nearer	_	_

11	the	_	_

1	What	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	the	_	_

4	was	_	_
5	better	_	_

1	He	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	a	_	_

1	The	_	_

1	Little	_	_
