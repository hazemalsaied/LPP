1	He	_	_

10	of	_	_
11	little	_	_
12	squeaks	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	It	_	_

1	Hurriedly	_	_

3	Farmer	_	_

6	squeak	_	_
7	again	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	with	_	1:OTH
10	it	_	1
11	a	_	_

1	In	_	_
2	a	_	_
3	flash	_	_
4	he	_	_
5	understood	_	_
6	what	_	_
7	had	_	_
8	happened	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	saw	_	_

5	Whitefoot	_	_
6	struggling	_	_
7	feebly	_	_

14	pulled	_	_
15	him	_	_
16	out	_	_

1	Whitefoot	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	so	_	_

1	A	_	_
2	great	_	_

13	.	_	_

1	Whitefoot	_	_
2	began	_	_
3	to	_	_
4	gasp	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	Farmer	_	_
3	Brown	_	_
4	's	_	_
5	boy	_	_
6	spread	_	_
7	his	_	_

14	rolled	_	_
15	Whitefoot	_	_
16	up	_	_

1	For	_	_

4	Whitefoot	_	_
5	lay	_	_
6	just	_	_
7	gasping	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	presently	_	_
3	his	_	_
4	breath	_	_
5	came	_	_
6	easier	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	after	_	1:OTH
10	a	_	1

1	But	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	too	_	_
5	weak	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	tired	_	_
8	to	_	_
9	move	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	so	_	_
12	he	_	_
13	just	_	_
14	lay	_	_
15	there	_	_
16	while	_	_
17	Farmer	_	_
18	Brown	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	Shadow	_	_
3	's	_	_
4	little	_	_

6	grew	_	_
7	red	_	_

1	Hardly	_	_

21	he	_	_

1	Probably	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	is	_	_
4	still	_	_
5	going	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	is	_	_
3	useless	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	follow	_	_
6	him	_	_
7	because	_	_
8	he	_	_

16	said	_	_

3	for	_	_
4	such	_	_

6	his	_	_

1	Once	_	_

16	Whitefoot	_	_
17	lived	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	and	_	_
20	did	_	_
21	n't	_	_
22	even	_	_
23	suspect	_	_

25	he	_	_
26	was	_	_
27	anywhere	_	1:OTH

1	Twice	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	Whitefoot	_	_
3	formed	_	_
4	the	_	_

6	of	_	_
7	doing	_	_
8	just	_	_
9	what	_	_
10	Timmy	_	_
11	the	_	_
12	Flying	_	_
13	Squirrel	_	_
14	did	_	_
15	;	_	_
16	he	_	_
17	remained	_	_
18	in	_	_
19	his	_	_

21	for	_	_
22	most	_	_
23	of	_	_
24	the	_	_
25	day	_	_
26	and	_	_
27	came	_	_
28	out	_	_
29	when	_	_
30	the	_	_
31	Black	_	_
32	Shadows	_	_
33	began	_	_

1	Timmy	_	_
