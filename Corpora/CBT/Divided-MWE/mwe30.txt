1	I	_	_
2	should	_	_

25	--	_	_
26	because	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	died	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	think	_	_
3	it	_	_

5	be	_	_
6	so	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	father	_	_
3	died	_	_

4	nobody	_	_
5	wanted	_	_
6	me	_	_

9	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	seems	_	_
3	to	_	_

21	but	_	_
22	he	_	_
23	was	_	_
24	quite	_	_

26	that	_	_
27	Anne	_	_

29	and	_	_
30	he	_	_
