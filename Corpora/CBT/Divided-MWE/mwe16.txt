1	Why	_	_

1	Though	_	_

1	He	_	_

1	Then	_	_

1	How	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	longed	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	get	_	1:OTH;2:OTH
6	down	_	1;2
7	to	_	1

1	But	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	brave	_	_
4	little	_	_

6	as	_	_
7	he	_	_

10	he	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	he	_	_

9	his	_	_

18	he	_	_

2	in	_	1:OTH
3	a	_	1

1	Oh	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	by	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	stream	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	he	_	_
8	saw	_	_
9	the	_	_

1	As	_	_
2	Tom	_	_
3	looked	_	_
4	down	_	_

1	Ah	_	_
2	!	_	_

1	perhaps	_	_
2	she	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	there	_	_
3	were	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	church-bells	_	_
6	ringing	_	_
7	again	_	_

1	Surely	_	_
2	there	_	_

7	down	_	_
8	there	_	_

1	Tom	_	_

30	but	_	_
31	he	_	_
32	was	_	_
33	wrong	_	_
34	about	_	_
35	getting	_	_
36	down	_	_
37	in	_	_
38	five	_	_
39	minutes	_	_
40	,	_	_
41	for	_	_
42	the	_	_
43	cottage	_	_
44	was	_	_
45	more	_	1:OTH

2	what	_	_

4	he	_	_

1	Sometimes	_	_

30	he	_	_

1	Very	_	_
2	fanciful	_	_
3	ladies	_	_
4	they	_	_
5	were	_	_
6	;	_	_
7	none	_	_

1	One	_	_

8	then	_	_

26	stuck	_	_
27	it	_	_

31	and	_	_
32	the	_	_

34	shell	_	_
35	was	_	_
36	alive	_	_
37	,	_	_

52	the	_	_

55	not	_	_
56	let	_	_

65	being	_	_
66	rude	_	_

68	selfish	_	_
69	,	_	_
70	as	_	_

72	people	_	_
73	are	_	_
74	apt	_	_

78	then	_	_
79	she	_	_
80	stuck	_	_

96	so	_	_
97	on	_	_

99	till	_	_
100	she	_	_

18	``	_	_

14	''	_	_
15	and	_	_
16	she	_	_
17	stuck	_	_
18	it	_	_
19	on	_	_
20	her	_	_
21	back	_	_
22	,	_	_
23	and	_	_
24	marched	_	_
25	about	_	_
26	with	_	1:OTH
27	it	_	1
28	quite	_	_
29	proud	_	_
30	,	_	_
31	though	_	_
32	it	_	_
33	was	_	_
34	very	_	_
35	inconvenient	_	_
36	indeed	_	_
37	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	at	_	3:OTH
4	that	_	3
5	,	_	_
6	tails	_	_
7	became	_	_
8	all	_	2:OTH
9	the	_	2
10	fashion	_	_
11	among	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	caddis-baits	_	_
14	in	_	1:OTH
15	that	_	1
16	pool	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	as	_	_
19	they	_	_
20	were	_	_
21	at	_	_

29	May	_	_
30	,	_	_
31	and	_	_
32	they	_	_
33	all	_	_
34	toddled	_	_
35	about	_	_
36	with	_	_
37	long	_	_
38	straws	_	_
39	sticking	_	_
40	out	_	_
41	behind	_	_

52	over	_	_
53	each	_	_
54	other	_	_
55	,	_	_
56	and	_	_
57	looking	_	_
58	so	_	_
59	ridiculous	_	_
60	,	_	_
61	that	_	_
62	Tom	_	_
63	laughed	_	_
64	at	_	_
65	them	_	_
66	till	_	_
67	he	_	_
68	cried	_	_
69	,	_	_
70	as	_	_
71	we	_	_
72	did	_	_
73	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	they	_	_
3	were	_	_
4	quite	_	_
5	right	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	you	_	1:OTH
8	know	_	1
9	;	_	_
10	for	_	_
11	people	_	_
12	must	_	_
13	always	_	_
14	follow	_	_
15	the	_	_
16	fashion	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	even	_	_
19	if	_	_
20	it	_	_
21	be	_	_
22	spoon-bonnets	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	sometimes	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	came	_	_
5	to	_	_
6	a	_	_
7	deep	_	_
8	still	_	_
9	reach	_	_
10	;	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	there	_	_
13	he	_	_
14	saw	_	_
15	the	_	_
16	water-forests	_	_
17	.	_	_

1	They	_	_
2	would	_	_
3	have	_	_
4	looked	_	_

6	you	_	_
7	only	_	_
8	little	_	_
9	weeds	_	_
10	:	_	_
11	but	_	_
12	Tom	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	you	_	_
15	must	_	_
16	remember	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	was	_	_
19	so	_	_
20	little	_	_
21	that	_	_
22	everything	_	_
23	looked	_	_
24	a	_	_
25	hundred	_	_
26	times	_	_
27	as	_	_
28	big	_	_
29	to	_	_
30	him	_	_
31	as	_	_
32	it	_	_
33	does	_	_
34	to	_	_
35	you	_	_
36	,	_	_
37	just	_	_
38	as	_	_
39	things	_	_
40	do	_	_
41	to	_	_
42	a	_	_
43	minnow	_	_
44	,	_	_
45	who	_	_
46	sees	_	_
47	and	_	_
48	catches	_	_
49	the	_	_
50	little	_	_
51	water-creatures	_	_
52	which	_	_
53	you	_	_
54	can	_	_

60	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	in	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	water-forest	_	_
5	he	_	_
6	saw	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	water-monkeys	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	water	_	_
11	-	_	_
12	squirrels	_	_
13	-LRB-	_	_
14	they	_	_
15	had	_	_
16	all	_	_
17	six	_	_
18	legs	_	_
19	,	_	_
20	though	_	_
21	;	_	_
22	everything	_	_
23	almost	_	_
24	has	_	_
25	six	_	_
26	legs	_	_
27	in	_	_
28	the	_	_
29	water	_	_
30	,	_	_
31	except	_	_
32	efts	_	_
33	and	_	_
34	water-babies	_	_
35	-RRB-	_	_
36	;	_	_
37	and	_	_
38	nimbly	_	_
39	enough	_	_
40	they	_	_
41	ran	_	_
42	among	_	_
43	the	_	_
44	branches	_	_
45	.	_	_

1	There	_	_
2	were	_	_

4	there	_	_
5	too	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	in	_	_
8	thousands	_	_
9	;	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	Tom	_	_
12	tried	_	_
13	to	_	_
14	pick	_	_
15	them	_	_
16	:	_	_
17	but	_	_
18	as	_	_
19	soon	_	_
20	as	_	_
21	he	_	_
22	touched	_	_
23	them	_	_
24	,	_	_
25	they	_	_
26	drew	_	_
27	themselves	_	_
28	in	_	_
29	and	_	_
30	turned	_	_
31	into	_	_
32	knots	_	_
33	of	_	_
34	jelly	_	_
35	;	_	_
36	and	_	_
37	then	_	_
38	Tom	_	_
39	saw	_	_
40	that	_	_
41	they	_	_
42	were	_	_
43	all	_	_
44	alive	_	_
45	--	_	_
46	bells	_	_
47	,	_	_

68	busy	_	_
69	,	_	_
70	just	_	_
71	as	_	_
72	Tom	_	_
73	was	_	_
74	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	now	_	_
3	he	_	_

5	grew	_	_
6	quite	_	_
7	tame	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	used	_	1:OTH
11	to	_	1
12	tell	_	_
13	him	_	_
14	strange	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	trout	_	_

5	he	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	Tom	_	_
3	used	_	1:OTH

1	He	_	_

9	and	_	_
10	a	_	_
11	long	_	_

13	he	_	_

1	He	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	do	_	1:OTH
4	you	_	1;2:OTH;3:OTH

2	it	_	_

56	perhaps	_	_
57	give	_	_

1	Some	_	_

1	Well	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	I	_	_

2	It	_	_

5	a	_	_
6	very	_	_
7	strange	_	_

29	fare	_	_
30	accordingly	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	is	_	_

12	I	_	_
13	am	_	_

15	sure	_	_
16	that	_	_
17	she	_	_

20	.	_	_

1	Perhaps	_	_

34	grew	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	saw	_	_

1	For	_	_
2	there	_	_
3	they	_	_

1	Till	_	_
2	then	_	_
3	,	_	_
4	they	_	_
5	must	_	_
