1	Of	_	_
2	course	_	_

8	a	_	_

10	,	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	he	_	_
13	wondered	_	_
14	what	_	_
15	you	_	_
16	play	_	1:OTH
17	at	_	1
18	with	_	_
19	them	_	_
20	,	_	_

16	sometimes	_	_

29	he	_	_
30	was	_	_
31	quite	_	_
32	proud	_	_
33	to	_	_

35	that	_	_
36	he	_	_

1	Lest	_	_
2	it	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	alive	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	addressed	_	_
8	it	_	_
9	politely	_	_
10	;	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	then	_	_

24	felt	_	_
25	it	_	_
26	cautiously	_	_
27	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	gave	_	_
3	it	_	_

5	little	_	_
6	push	_	_
7	,	_	_

12	him	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	which	_	_
15	made	_	_
