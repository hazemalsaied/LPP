1	So	_	_
2	Regin	_	_
3	made	_	_
4	a	_	_
5	sword	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	Sigurd	_	_
9	tried	_	_
10	it	_	_
11	with	_	_
12	a	_	_
13	blow	_	_
14	on	_	_
15	a	_	_

7	Sigurd	_	_
8	broke	_	_
9	that	_	_
10	too	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	Sigurd	_	_
3	went	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	his	_	_
6	mother	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	asked	_	_

21	gave	_	_
22	them	_	_
23	to	_	_
24	Regin	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	hammered	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	wrought	_	_
6	them	_	_
7	into	_	_
8	a	_	_
9	new	_	_

11	,	_	_
12	so	_	_
13	sharp	_	_
14	that	_	_

22	.	_	_

1	Sigurd	_	_
2	tried	_	_
3	this	_	_
4	blade	_	_
5	on	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	lump	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	iron	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	it	_	_
13	did	_	_
14	not	_	_
15	break	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	but	_	_
18	split	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	threw	_	_
4	a	_	_
5	lock	_	_
6	of	_	_
7	wool	_	_
8	into	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	Sigurd	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_

20	the	_	_

4	the	_	_
5	princes	_	_
6	did	_	_

5	,	_	_
6	'	_	_
7	she	_	_
8	answered	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	the	_	_

21	the	_	_

24	they	_	_
25	suddenly	_	_
26	found	_	_
27	themselves	_	_

30	castle	_	_
31	in	_	_
32	which	_	_
33	there	_	_
34	lived	_	_
35	a	_	_
36	band	_	_
37	of	_	_
38	robbers	_	_
39	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	prince	_	_

12	only	_	_
13	badly	_	_
14	wounded	_	_
15	,	_	_

4	and	_	_
5	his	_	_

14	be	_	_
15	dead	_	_
16	sat	_	_
17	up	_	_
18	and	_	_
19	said	_	_

34	sought	_	_
35	him	_	_
36	everywhere	_	_
37	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	they	_	_
3	led	_	_
4	him	_	_
5	to	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	king	_	_

10	he	_	_

13	that	_	_
14	it	_	_
15	was	_	_
16	his	_	_
17	son-in-law	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	the	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	am	_	_
4	afraid	_	_
5	of	_	_
6	your	_	_

1	May	_	_
2	I	_	_

20	'	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	he	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	she	_	_

1	As	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	went	_	_
4	round	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	trees	_	_
7	he	_	_
8	saw	_	_
9	that	_	_
10	blood	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	wept	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	said	_	_
6	:	_	_
7	`	_	_

7	'	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	too	_	_
4	set	_	1:OTH
5	out	_	1
6	towards	_	_
7	the	_	_

9	in	_	_
10	which	_	_
11	his	_	_

16	and	_	_
17	his	_	_
18	faithful	_	_
19	beasts	_	_

15	prince	_	_
16	come	_	1:OTH;1:OTH;3:OTH
17	back	_	3
18	to	_	_
19	them	_	_
20	,	_	_

22	they	_	_
23	gathered	_	_
24	round	_	_
25	him	_	_
26	,	_	_
27	as	_	_
28	they	_	_
29	had	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	they	_	_

6	together	_	_
7	she	_	_

5	him	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	he	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	it	_	_
