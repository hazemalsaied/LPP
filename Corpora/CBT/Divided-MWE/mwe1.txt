37	I	_	_
38	am	_	_
39	quite	_	_
40	convinced	_	_

11	in	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	here	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	I	_	_
6	fled	_	_
7	after	_	_
8	I	_	_
9	had	_	_
10	gazed	_	_
11	on	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	Princess	_	_
14	Argentine	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	but	_	_
17	instead	_	1:OTH
18	of	_	1
19	love	_	_
20	I	_	_
21	only	_	_
22	saw	_	_
23	scorn	_	_
24	and	_	_
25	contempt	_	_
26	.	_	_

1	Think	_	_
2	how	_	_

4	must	_	_
5	be	_	_
6	my	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	Prince	_	_
4	of	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	Golden	_	_
7	Isle	_	_
8	was	_	_
9	enchanted	_	_
10	with	_	_
11	this	_	_
12	conversation	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	for	_	_
15	the	_	_
16	Princess	_	_
17	Argentine	_	_
18	was	_	_
19	his	_	_
20	sister	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	and	_	_
23	he	_	_
24	hoped	_	_
25	,	_	_
26	by	_	_
27	means	_	_
28	of	_	_
29	her	_	_
30	influence	_	_

35	the	_	_
36	Gnomes	_	_
37	,	_	_
38	to	_	_
39	obtain	_	_

43	the	_	_
44	release	_	_
45	of	_	_
46	Rosalie	_	_
47	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	joyfully	_	_
4	returned	_	_
5	to	_	_
6	his	_	_
7	father	_	_
8	's	_	_
9	palace	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	where	_	_
12	he	_	_
13	found	_	_
14	his	_	_
15	friend	_	_
16	the	_	_
17	Fairy	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	who	_	_
20	at	_	1:OTH
21	once	_	1
22	presented	_	_
23	him	_	_
24	with	_	_
25	a	_	_
26	magic	_	_
27	pebble	_	_
28	like	_	_
29	his	_	_
30	own	_	_
31	.	_	_

1	As	_	_
2	may	_	_
3	be	_	_
4	imagined	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	lost	_	_
8	no	_	_
9	time	_	_
10	in	_	_
11	setting	_	_
12	out	_	_
13	to	_	_
14	deliver	_	_
15	Rosalie	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	and	_	_
18	travelled	_	_
19	so	_	_
20	fast	_	_
21	that	_	_
22	he	_	_
23	soon	_	_
24	arrived	_	_
25	at	_	_
26	the	_	_
27	forest	_	_
28	,	_	_
29	in	_	_
30	the	_	_

33	which	_	_
34	she	_	_
35	lay	_	_
36	a	_	_
37	captive	_	_
38	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	though	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	found	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	palace	_	_
7	he	_	_
8	did	_	_
9	not	_	_
10	find	_	_
11	Rosalie	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	hunted	_	_
3	high	_	1:OTH
4	and	_	1
5	low	_	1
6	,	_	_
7	but	_	_
8	there	_	_
9	was	_	_
10	no	_	_
11	sign	_	_
12	of	_	_
13	her	_	_
14	,	_	_
15	and	_	_
16	his	_	_
17	despair	_	_
18	was	_	_
19	so	_	_
20	great	_	_
21	that	_	_
22	he	_	_
23	was	_	_
24	ready	_	_
25	,	_	_
26	a	_	_
27	thousand	_	_
28	times	_	_
29	over	_	_

33	his	_	_
34	own	_	_
35	life	_	_
36	.	_	_

1	At	_	_
2	last	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	remembered	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	conversation	_	_
7	of	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	two	_	_
10	Princes	_	_
11	about	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	cabinets	_	_
14	of	_	_
15	the	_	_
16	years	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	and	_	_
19	that	_	_
20	if	_	_
21	he	_	_
22	could	_	_
23	manage	_	_
24	to	_	_
25	reach	_	_
26	the	_	_
27	oak	_	_
28	tree	_	_
29	,	_	_
30	he	_	_
31	would	_	_

40	Rosalie	_	_
41	.	_	_

1	Happily	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	soon	_	_
5	found	_	_
6	out	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	secret	_	_
9	of	_	_
10	the	_	_
11	passage	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	entered	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	cabinet	_	_
16	of	_	_
17	the	_	_
18	present	_	_
19	,	_	_
20	where	_	_
21	he	_	_
22	saw	_	_
23	reflected	_	_
24	in	_	_
25	the	_	_
26	mirrors	_	_
27	the	_	_
28	unfortunate	_	_
29	Rosalie	_	_
30	sitting	_	_
31	on	_	_
32	the	_	_

34	weeping	_	_
35	bitterly	_	_
36	,	_	_
37	and	_	_
38	surrounded	_	_
39	with	_	_
40	genii	_	_
41	,	_	_
42	who	_	_
43	never	_	_
44	left	_	_
45	her	_	_
46	night	_	_
47	or	_	_
48	day	_	_
49	.	_	_

1	This	_	_
2	sight	_	_
3	only	_	_
4	increased	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	misery	_	_
7	of	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	Prince	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	for	_	_
12	he	_	_
13	did	_	_
14	not	_	_
15	know	_	_

17	the	_	_
18	castle	_	_
19	was	_	_

27	it	_	_
28	.	_	_

1	However	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	resolved	_	_
5	to	_	2:OTH
6	seek	_	_
7	the	_	2
8	whole	_	1:OTH

10	through	_	_

12	he	_	_

15	the	_	_
16	right	_	_
17	place	_	_
18	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	began	_	_
3	by	_	_

6	in	_	2
7	a	_	_

12	his	_	_

14	luck	_	1
15	followed	_	_

17	even	_	_
18	on	_	_
19	the	_	_
20	sea	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	He	_	_

20	beating	_	_
21	about	_	_

23	the	_	_

1	The	_	_

30	him	_	_

1	His	_	_

8	he	_	_
9	advanced	_	_
10	cautiously	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	they	_	_

1	The	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	he	_	_

1	The	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	the	_	_

36	she	_	_
37	burst	_	1:OTH
38	into	_	1

1	The	_	_
2	shepherd	_	_
3	asked	_	_
4	her	_	_
5	why	_	_
6	she	_	_
7	was	_	_
8	crying	_	_
9	,	_	_

11	left	_	_

7	There	_	_

13	a	_	_
14	Prince	_	_

25	be	_	_
26	a	_	_
27	true	_	_
28	Princess	_	_
29	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	travelled	_	_
4	through	_	_

6	whole	_	1:OTH
7	world	_	1
8	to	_	_
9	find	_	_

12	but	_	_
13	there	_	_
14	was	_	_
15	always	_	_
16	something	_	_
17	against	_	_
18	each	_	_
19	.	_	_

1	There	_	_
2	were	_	_
3	plenty	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	she	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	this	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	next	_	_

4	she	_	_
5	was	_	_
6	asked	_	_
7	how	_	_
8	she	_	_
9	had	_	_
10	slept	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	`	_	_

1	said	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	Princess	_	_
4	.	_	_
5	'	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	scarcely	_	_
3	closed	_	_

7	night	_	_
8	!	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	am	_	_
3	sure	_	_
4	I	_	_
5	do	_	_
6	n't	_	_
7	know	_	_
8	what	_	_
9	was	_	_
10	in	_	_
11	the	_	_
12	bed	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	laid	_	_
3	on	_	_
4	something	_	_
5	so	_	_
6	hard	_	_
7	that	_	_
8	my	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	is	_	_
3	dreadful	_	_
4	!	_	_
5	'	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	they	_	_
3	perceived	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	she	_	_
6	was	_	_
7	a	_	_
8	true	_	_
9	Princess	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	because	_	_
12	she	_	_

14	felt	_	_
15	the	_	_
16	pea	_	_
17	through	_	_
18	the	_	_

1	No	_	_
2	one	_	_

7	could	_	_
8	be	_	_
9	so	_	_
10	sensitive	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	Prince	_	_
4	married	_	_
5	her	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	for	_	_
8	now	_	_
9	he	_	_
10	knew	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	the	_	_

5	put	_	1:OTH

7	the	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	the	_	_
