3	as	_	_
4	the	_	_

19	the	_	_

20	neither	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	afraid	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	think	_	_
6	what	_	_
7	had	_	_
8	befallen	_	_
9	my	_	_

11	,	_	_

13	afraid	_	_

15	look	_	_

18	so	_	_
19	empty	_	_

9	and	_	_
10	my	_	_

12	that	_	_
13	now	_	_

20	I	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	set	_	1:OTH

7	the	_	_

17	I	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	at	_	_
3	the	_	_

1	Although	_	_

2	the	_	_
