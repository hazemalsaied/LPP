16	next	_	_
17	day	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	but	_	_
20	I	_	_
21	decided	_	_
22	I	_	_
23	could	_	_
24	n't	_	_
25	do	_	_
26	that	_	_
27	,	_	_
28	because	_	_
29	it	_	_

31	be	_	_
32	acting	_	_
33	a	_	_
34	lie	_	_
35	,	_	_
36	and	_	_
37	father	_	_
38	told	_	_
39	us	_	_
40	after	_	_
41	mother	_	_
42	died	_	_
43	that	_	_
44	was	_	_
45	something	_	_
46	we	_	_
47	must	_	_
48	never	_	_
49	,	_	_
50	never	_	_
51	do	_	_
52	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	is	_	_
3	just	_	_
4	as	_	_
5	bad	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	act	_	_
8	a	_	_
9	lie	_	_
10	as	_	_
11	to	_	_
12	tell	_	_
13	one	_	_
14	,	_	_
15	though	_	_
16	I	_	_
17	know	_	_
18	some	_	_
19	people	_	_
20	,	_	_
21	right	_	_
22	here	_	_
23	in	_	_
24	the	_	_
25	Glen	_	_
26	,	_	_
27	who	_	_
28	act	_	_
29	them	_	_
30	,	_	_
31	and	_	_
32	never	_	_
33	seem	_	_
34	to	_	_
35	feel	_	_
36	a	_	_
37	bit	_	_
38	bad	_	_
39	about	_	_
40	it	_	_
41	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	will	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	mention	_	_
5	any	_	_
6	names	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	but	_	_
9	I	_	_
10	know	_	_
11	who	_	_
12	they	_	_
13	are	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	so	_	_
16	does	_	_
17	father	_	_
18	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	tried	_	_
4	my	_	_
5	best	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	catch	_	2:OTH
8	cold	_	2
9	and	_	_
10	really	_	_
11	be	_	1:OTH
12	sick	_	_
13	by	_	_
14	standing	_	_
15	on	_	1
16	the	_	_

26	until	_	_
27	Jerry	_	_
28	pulled	_	_
29	me	_	_
30	off	_	_
31	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	it	_	_
3	did	_	_
4	n't	_	_
5	hurt	_	_
6	me	_	_
7	a	_	_
8	bit	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	so	_	_
11	I	_	_
12	could	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	just	_	_
4	decided	_	_
5	I	_	_
6	would	_	_
7	put	_	_

14	careful	_	_
15	to	_	_
16	wash	_	_
17	my	_	_
