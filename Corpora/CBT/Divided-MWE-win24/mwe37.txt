1	Uncle	_	_

1	When	_	_

7	Mrs.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	bitterly	_	_
4	disappointed	_	_
5	.	_	_

1	Somehow	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	had	_	_
5	expected	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	meet	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	not	_	_
10	indeed	_	_
11	a	_	_

14	palpitating	_	_
15	with	_	_
16	youthful	_	_
17	bloom	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	but	_	_
20	a	_	_
21	woman	_	_
22	of	_	_
23	ripe	_	_
24	maturity	_	_
25	,	_	_
26	dowered	_	_

28	the	_	_
29	beauty	_	_
30	of	_	_
31	harmonious	_	_
32	middle-age	_	_
33	--	_	_
34	the	_	_
35	feminine	_	_
36	counterpart	_	_
37	of	_	_
38	Uncle	_	_
39	Dick	_	_
40	.	_	_

1	Instead	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	found	_	_
5	in	_	_
6	Rose	_	_
7	Lawrence	_	_
8	a	_	_
9	small	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	faded	_	_
12	woman	_	_
13	of	_	_
14	forty-five	_	_

16	gowned	_	_
17	in	_	_
18	shabby	_	_
19	black	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	evidently	_	_
4	been	_	_
5	very	_	_
6	pretty	_	_
7	once	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	but	_	_
10	bloom	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	grace	_	_
13	were	_	_
14	gone	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	Her	_	_
2	face	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	a	_	_
5	sweet	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	gentle	_	_
8	expression	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	but	_	_
11	was	_	_
12	tired	_	_
13	and	_	_
14	worn	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	and	_	_
17	her	_	_
18	fair	_	_
19	hair	_	_
20	was	_	_
21	plentifully	_	_
22	streaked	_	_
23	with	_	_
24	grey	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	Alas	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	thought	_	_
5	compassionately	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	for	_	_
8	Uncle	_	_
9	Dick	_	_
10	's	_	_
11	dreams	_	_
12	!	_	_

1	What	_	_

4	the	_	_

6	to	_	_
7	her	_	_
8	must	_	_
9	have	_	_
10	given	_	_
11	him	_	_
12	!	_	_

1	Could	_	_
2	this	_	_
3	be	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	woman	_	_
6	on	_	_
7	whom	_	_
8	he	_	_
9	had	_	_
10	lavished	_	_
11	such	_	1:OTH
12	a	_	1;2:OTH
13	life-wealth	_	_
14	of	_	2
15	love	_	_
16	and	_	_
17	reverence	_	_
18	?	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	tried	_	_
3	to	_	_
4	talk	_	1:OTH
5	to	_	1
6	her	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	but	_	_
9	I	_	_
10	found	_	_
11	her	_	_
12	shy	_	_
13	and	_	_
14	timid	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	seemed	_	_
3	to	_	_
4	me	_	_
5	uninteresting	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	commonplace	_	_
8	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	this	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	Uncle	_	_
5	Dick	_	_
6	's	_	_
7	Rose	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	joy	_	_
10	!	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	so	_	_
4	sorry	_	_
5	for	_	_
6	Uncle	_	_
7	Dick	_	_
8	that	_	_
9	I	_	_
10	shrank	_	_
11	from	_	_
12	meeting	_	_
13	him	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	Nevertheless	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	went	_	_
5	over	_	_
6	after	_	_
7	tea	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	fearing	_	_
10	that	_	_

12	might	_	_
13	misunderstand	_	_

15	nay	_	_

17	rather	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	understand	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	in	_	_

8	he	_	_

10	down	_	_
11	the	_	_

13	where	_	_
14	the	_	_

9	the	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	looked	_	_
3	at	_	_
4	Uncle	_	_

6	in	_	_
