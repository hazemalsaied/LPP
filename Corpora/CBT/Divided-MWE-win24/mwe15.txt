1	The	_	_

1	So	_	_

24	kept	_	_
25	away	_	_

27	for	_	_

1	Of	_	_

9	this	_	_
10	behaviour	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	though	_	_
13	he	_	_

1	Soon	_	_

1	Like	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	rest	_	_
4	,	_	_
5	Virgilius	_	_
6	went	_	_
7	to	_	_

1	This	_	_

3	naturally	_	_
4	did	_	_
5	not	_	_

7	Virgilius	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	turning	_	_
12	on	_	_
13	his	_	1:OTH

15	,	_	_
16	he	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	the	_	_
