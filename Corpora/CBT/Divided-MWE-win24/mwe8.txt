20	hideous	_	_
21	heads	_	_
22	beneath	_	_
23	their	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	the	_	_

1	If	_	_
2	the	_	_

12	into	_	_
13	stone	_	_
14	by	_	_
15	the	_	_

23	she	_	_

25	so	_	_
26	awful	_	_
27	;	_	_
28	but	_	_
29	he	_	_
30	had	_	_
31	thought	_	_

43	.	_	_

1	As	_	_
2	soon	_	_
3	as	_	_
4	he	_	_
5	caught	_	_
6	sight	_	_
7	of	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	three	_	_
10	from	_	_
11	far	_	_
12	off	_	_
13	he	_	_
14	took	_	_
15	his	_	_
16	shining	_	_
17	shield	_	2:OTH
18	from	_	2
19	his	_	_
20	shoulders	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	and	_	_
23	held	_	_
24	it	_	_
25	up	_	_
26	like	_	_
27	a	_	_
28	mirror	_	_
29	,	_	_
30	so	_	1:OTH
31	that	_	1
32	he	_	_
33	saw	_	_
34	the	_	_
35	Dreadful	_	_
36	Women	_	_
37	reflected	_	_
38	in	_	_
39	it	_	_
40	,	_	_
41	and	_	_
42	did	_	_
43	not	_	_
44	see	_	_
45	the	_	_
46	Terrible	_	_
47	Head	_	_
48	itself	_	_
49	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	came	_	_
4	nearer	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	nearer	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	till	_	_
9	he	_	_
10	reckoned	_	_
11	that	_	_
12	he	_	_
13	was	_	_
14	within	_	_
15	a	_	_
16	sword	_	_

19	of	_	_
20	the	_	_

22	,	_	_
23	and	_	_
24	he	_	_
25	guessed	_	_
26	where	_	_
27	he	_	_
28	should	_	_
29	strike	_	1:OTH
30	a	_	1
31	back	_	_
32	blow	_	_
33	behind	_	_
34	him	_	_
35	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	drew	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	Sword	_	_
6	of	_	_
7	Sharpness	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	struck	_	_
10	once	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	the	_	_
14	Terrible	_	_
15	Head	_	_
16	was	_	_
17	cut	_	_
18	from	_	_

20	shoulders	_	_
21	of	_	_
22	the	_	_
23	creature	_	_
24	,	_	_
25	and	_	_
26	the	_	_
27	blood	_	_
28	leaped	_	_
29	out	_	_
30	and	_	_
31	struck	_	_
32	him	_	_
33	like	_	_
34	a	_	_
35	blow	_	_
36	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	thrust	_	_
4	the	_	_

6	Head	_	_
7	into	_	_
8	his	_	_

12	flew	_	_
13	away	_	_
14	without	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	two	_	_
4	Dreadful	_	_
5	Sisters	_	_
6	who	_	_
7	were	_	_

11	and	_	_
12	rose	_	_
13	in	_	1:OTH

16	like	_	_
17	great	_	_
18	birds	_	_

37	him	_	_
38	up	_	_
39	the	_	_

1	The	_	_

4	so	_	_
5	frightened	_	_
6	or	_	1:OTH
7	so	_	1
8	tired	_	_
9	that	_	_

25	there	_	_
26	she	_	_
27	hung	_	_
28	,	_	_
29	as	_	_
30	if	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	boy	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	very	_	_
5	sorry	_	_
6	for	_	_
7	her	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	flew	_	_
10	down	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	stood	_	_
13	beside	_	_
14	her	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	When	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	spoke	_	_
4	she	_	_
5	raised	_	_
6	her	_	_
7	head	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	looked	_	_
10	round	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	but	_	_
13	his	_	_
14	voice	_	_
15	only	_	_
16	seemed	_	_
17	to	_	_
18	frighten	_	_
19	her	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	remembered	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	he	_	_
6	was	_	_
7	wearing	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	Cap	_	_
10	of	_	_
11	Darkness	_	_
12	,	_	_

14	that	_	_
15	she	_	_
16	could	_	_

19	him	_	_
20	,	_	_
21	not	_	_
22	see	_	_
23	him	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	took	_	_
4	it	_	_
5	off	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	there	_	_
9	he	_	_
10	stood	_	_
11	before	_	_

37	and	_	_
38	a	_	_
39	laughing	_	_

41	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	thought	_	_
4	her	_	_
5	the	_	_

7	beautiful	_	_
8	girl	_	_
9	in	_	1:OTH
10	the	_	1

1	So	_	_
2	first	_	_
3	with	_	_
4	one	_	_
5	blow	_	_
6	of	_	_
7	the	_	_
8	Sword	_	_
9	of	_	_
10	Sharpness	_	_
11	he	_	_
12	cut	_	_
13	the	_	_
14	iron	_	_
15	chain	_	_
16	that	_	_
17	bound	_	_
18	her	_	_
19	,	_	_
20	and	_	_
21	then	_	_
22	he	_	_
23	asked	_	_
24	her	_	_
25	what	_	_
26	she	_	_
27	did	_	_
28	there	_	_
29	,	_	_
30	and	_	_
31	why	_	_
32	men	_	_
33	treated	_	_
34	her	_	_
35	so	_	_
36	cruelly	_	_
37	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	she	_	_
3	told	_	_
4	him	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	she	_	_
7	was	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	daughter	_	_
10	of	_	_
11	the	_	_
12	King	_	_
13	of	_	_
14	that	_	_
15	country	_	_
16	,	_	_
17	and	_	_
18	that	_	_
19	she	_	_
20	was	_	_
21	tied	_	_
22	there	_	_
23	to	_	_
24	be	_	_
25	eaten	_	_
26	by	_	_

30	out	_	1:OTH

35	for	_	_
36	the	_	_

38	came	_	_
39	and	_	_
40	devoured	_	_
41	a	_	_
42	girl	_	_
43	every	_	_
44	day	_	_
45	.	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	lot	_	_
4	had	_	_
5	fallen	_	_
6	on	_	_
7	her	_	_
8	;	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	as	_	_
11	she	_	_
12	was	_	_
13	just	_	_
14	saying	_	_
15	this	_	_
16	a	_	_
17	long	_	_

31	snapped	_	_
32	at	_	_
33	the	_	_

35	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	beast	_	_
4	had	_	_
5	been	_	_
6	too	_	_
7	greedy	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	too	_	_
10	hurried	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	so	_	_
13	he	_	_
14	missed	_	_

1	Before	_	_

6	bite	_	_
7	again	_	_
8	the	_	_

19	and	_	_
20	held	_	_
21	it	_	_
22	up	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	when	_	_
3	the	_	_
4	sea	_	_
5	beast	_	_
6	leaped	_	_
7	out	_	_
8	once	_	_

10	its	_	_

16	,	_	_
17	and	_	_
18	instantly	_	_
19	it	_	_

21	turned	_	_
22	into	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	the	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	the	_	_

22	for	_	_
23	her	_	_
24	death	_	_
25	,	_	_
26	and	_	_
27	they	_	_
28	could	_	_
29	hardly	_	_
30	believe	_	_
31	their	_	_

1	The	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	all	_	1:OTH
3	the	_	1

1	And	_	_
2	they	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	the	_	_

7	the	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	on	_	1:OTH
3	the	_	1

5	they	_	_

14	and	_	_
15	it	_	_

34	quoit-throwers	_	_
35	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	boy	_	_
4	would	_	_
5	try	_	_

39	so	_	_
40	that	_	_
41	he	_	_

1	The	_	_

2	the	_	_

1	These	_	_
2	I	_	_

10	,	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	thus	_	_

6	in	_	1:OTH
7	my	_	_

10	I	_	_
11	began	_	_

1	Letting	_	_
