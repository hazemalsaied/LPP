5	This	_	_
6	girl	_	_
7	is	_	_
8	the	_	_

10	thing	_	_
11	that	_	_
12	God	_	_

12	so	_	_
13	clearly	_	_

4	well	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	strong	_	_
7	I	_	_
8	should	_	_
9	win	_	_
10	it	_	_
11	;	_	_
12	yes	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	I	_	_
15	believe	_	_
16	I	_	_
17	could	_	_
18	win	_	_

21	and	_	_
22	nothing	_	_

24	the	_	2

27	prevent	_	_
28	me	_	_
29	from	_	_
30	trying	_	_
31	,	_	_
32	but	_	_
33	,	_	_
34	as	_	_
35	things	_	_

38	it	_	_

1	Yet	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	can	_	_
4	not	_	_
5	resist	_	_
6	the	_	_

1	O	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	Sylvia	_	_

1	A	_	_
2	week	_	_
3	later	_	_
4	there	_	_
5	was	_	_
6	another	_	_
7	entry	_	_
8	:	_	_
9	July	_	_
10	Seventeenth	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	am	_	_
3	afraid	_	_
4	.	_	_

1	To-day	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	met	_	_
4	Sylvia	_	_
5	's	_	_
6	eyes	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	In	_	_
2	them	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	a	_	_
5	look	_	2:OTH
6	which	_	_
7	at	_	1:OTH;2
8	first	_	1
9	stirred	_	_
10	my	_	_
11	heart	_	_
12	to	_	_
13	its	_	_
14	deeps	_	_
15	with	_	_
16	tumultuous	_	_
17	delight	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	and	_	_
20	then	_	_
21	I	_	_
22	remembered	_	_
23	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	must	_	_
3	spare	_	_
4	her	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	suffering	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	at	_	_
9	whatever	_	_
10	cost	_	_
11	to	_	_
12	myself	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	must	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	let	_	_
5	myself	_	_
6	dwell	_	1:OTH
7	on	_	1
8	the	_	_
9	dangerous	_	_
10	sweetness	_	_
11	of	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	thought	_	_
14	that	_	_
15	her	_	_
16	heart	_	_
17	is	_	_
18	turning	_	_
19	to	_	_
20	me	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	What	_	_
2	would	_	_
3	be	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	crowning	_	_
6	joy	_	_
7	to	_	_
8	another	_	_
9	man	_	_
10	could	_	_
11	be	_	_
12	only	_	_
13	added	_	_
14	sorrow	_	_
15	to	_	_
16	me	_	_
17	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	:	_	_
3	July	_	_
4	Eighteenth	_	_
5	.	_	_

1	This	_	_
2	morning	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	took	_	_
5	the	_	_
6	train	_	_
7	to	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	city	_	_
10	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	determined	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	know	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	worst	_	_
8	once	_	1:OTH
9	for	_	1;2:OTH
10	all	_	1;2
11	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	time	_	_
3	had	_	_
4	come	_	1:OTH;1:OTH
5	when	_	_
6	I	_	_
7	must	_	_
8	.	_	_

1	My	_	_
2	doctor	_	_
3	at	_	2:OTH
4	home	_	2
5	had	_	_
6	put	_	1:OTH
7	me	_	_
8	off	_	1
9	with	_	_
10	vague	_	_
11	hopes	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	perhapses	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	went	_	_
4	to	_	_
5	a	_	_
6	noted	_	_
7	physician	_	_
8	in	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	city	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	told	_	_
3	him	_	_
4	I	_	_
5	wanted	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	whole	_	1:OTH
8	truth	_	1
9	--	_	_
10	I	_	_
11	made	_	_
12	him	_	_
13	tell	_	_
14	it	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	Stripped	_	_
2	of	_	_
3	all	_	_
4	softening	_	_
5	verbiage	_	_
6	it	_	_
7	is	_	_
8	this	_	_
9	:	_	_
10	I	_	_
11	have	_	_
12	perhaps	_	_
13	eight	_	_
14	months	_	_
15	or	_	_
16	a	_	2:OTH
17	year	_	_
18	to	_	2
19	live	_	_
20	--	_	_
21	no	_	1:OTH
22	more	_	1
23	!	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	expected	_	_
4	it	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	although	_	_
7	not	_	_
8	quite	_	1:OTH
9	so	_	1
10	soon	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	Yet	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	certainty	_	_
4	was	_	_
5	none	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	less	_	_
8	bitter	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	this	_	_
3	is	_	_
4	no	_	1:OTH
5	time	_	1
6	for	_	1
7	self-pity	_	_
8	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	is	_	_
3	of	_	_
4	Sylvia	_	_
5	I	_	_
6	must	_	_
7	think	_	_
8	now	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	shall	_	_
3	go	_	1:OTH;3:OTH
4	away	_	3
5	at	_	1;2:OTH
6	once	_	2
7	,	_	_
8	before	_	_

15	budding	_	_
16	in	_	_

26	that	_	_

3	.	_	_

1	It	_	_

1	I	_	_

7	before	_	_
8	others	_	_

8	Sylvia	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	Once	_	_
2	or	_	_
3	twice	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	have	_	_
4	decided	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	it	_	_
7	would	_	_
8	be	_	_

1	It	_	_
