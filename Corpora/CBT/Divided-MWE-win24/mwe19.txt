1	I	_	_
2	have	_	_
3	often	_	_
4	wondered	_	_
5	what	_	_
6	they	_	_
7	thought	_	_
8	of	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	peculiar	_	_

14	,	_	_
15	even	_	_
16	at	_	_

19	of	_	_
20	their	_	_
21	nearest	_	_
22	friends	_	_

5	,	_	_
6	roly-poly	_	_
7	little	_	_
8	fellows	_	_
9	they	_	_

15	adorned	_	_
16	and	_	_
17	adored	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	till	_	_
20	it	_	_
21	is	_	_
22	a	_	_
23	miracle	_	_
24	that	_	_
25	they	_	_
26	are	_	_
27	not	_	_
28	utterly	_	_
29	ruined	_	_
30	.	_	_

1	But	_	_

9	trials	_	_
10	begin	_	_
11	,	_	_

13	they	_	_
14	are	_	_
15	regarded	_	_
16	as	_	_
17	nuisances	_	_
18	till	_	_
19	they	_	_

1	Yet	_	_
2	that	_	_
3	very	_	_
4	time	_	_
5	of	_	_
6	neglect	_	_
7	is	_	_
8	the	_	_

32	that	_	_
