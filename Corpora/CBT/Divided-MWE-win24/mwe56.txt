1	Then	_	_

1	Buster	_	_
2	learned	_	_

1	Rather	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	they	_	_

1	He	_	_

6	Reddy	_	_
7	Fox	_	_
8	all	_	1:OTH
9	alone	_	1
10	tried	_	_
11	to	_	_

1	Indeed	_	_
2	,	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	now	_	_
3	it	_	_

20	so	_	_
21	many	_	_
22	frights	_	_
23	that	_	_

9	Danny	_	_
10	Meadow	_	_

15	from	_	_
16	Reddy	_	_
17	Fox	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	who	_	_
20	would	_	_
21	stop	_	_

23	dig	_	_
24	frantically	_	_

3	Fox	_	_
