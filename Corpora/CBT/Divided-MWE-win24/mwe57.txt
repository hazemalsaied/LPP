1	But	_	_
2	now	_	_
3	Spotty	_	_
4	was	_	_
5	beginning	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	wish	_	_
8	that	_	_
9	some	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	wanted	_	_

16	it	_	2
17	himself	_	_
18	,	_	_
19	and	_	_
20	he	_	_
21	wondered	_	_
22	what	_	_

1	Right	_	_
2	before	_	_
3	him	_	_
4	was	_	_

8	Reddy	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	he	_	_
11	had	_	_
12	openly	_	_
13	rejoiced	_	_

1	It	_	_

11	Sammy	_	_
12	dearly	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	then	_	_
3	it	_	_
4	would	_	_
5	make	_	_
6	such	_	1:OTH
7	a	_	1
8	splendid	_	_
9	story	_	_
10	to	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	watched	_	_

4	PADDY	_	_
5	WARNED	_	_
6	LIGHTFOOT	_	_
7	It	_	_
8	was	_	_
9	a	_	_
10	queer	_	_
11	partnership	_	_
12	,	_	_
13	that	_	_
14	partnership	_	_
15	between	_	_
16	Lightfoot	_	_
17	and	_	_
18	Paddy	_	_
19	,	_	_
20	but	_	_
21	it	_	_
22	was	_	_
23	a	_	_
24	good	_	_
25	partnership	_	_
26	.	_	_

1	They	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	been	_	_
4	the	_	_
5	best	_	_
6	of	_	_
7	friends	_	_
8	for	_	_
9	a	_	_
10	long	_	_
11	time	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	Paddy	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	always	_	_
4	been	_	_
5	glad	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	have	_	_
8	Lightfoot	_	_
9	visit	_	_
10	his	_	_
11	pond	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	To	_	_
2	tell	_	1:OTH
3	the	_	1
4	truth	_	1
5	,	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	was	_	_
8	rather	_	_
9	fond	_	2:OTH
10	of	_	2
11	handsome	_	_
12	Lightfoot	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	You	_	_
2	know	_	_
3	Paddy	_	_
4	is	_	_
5	himself	_	_
6	not	_	1:OTH
7	at	_	1;2:OTH
8	all	_	1;2
9	handsome	_	_
10	.	_	_

1	On	_	_
2	land	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	is	_	_
5	a	_	_
6	rather	_	_
7	clumsy-looking	_	_
8	fellow	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	really	_	_
11	homely	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	admired	_	_
4	Lightfoot	_	_
5	greatly	_	_
6	.	_	_

1	That	_	_
2	is	_	_
3	one	_	_
4	reason	_	_
5	why	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	proposed	_	_
8	that	_	_
9	they	_	_
10	be	_	_
11	partners	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	Lightfoot	_	_
2	himself	_	_
3	thought	_	_
4	the	_	1:OTH
5	idea	_	1
6	a	_	_
7	splendid	_	_
8	one	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	spent	_	_
3	that	_	_
4	night	_	_
5	browsing	_	_
6	not	_	_
7	far	_	_
8	from	_	_
9	Paddy	_	_
10	's	_	_
11	pond	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	With	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	coming	_	_
4	of	_	_
5	daylight	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	lay	_	1:OTH;2:OTH
8	down	_	2
9	in	_	1
10	a	_	_
11	thicket	_	_
12	of	_	_
13	young	_	_
14	hemlock-trees	_	_
15	near	_	_
16	the	_	_
17	upper	_	_
18	end	_	_
19	of	_	_
20	the	_	_
21	pond	_	_
22	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	a	_	_
4	quiet	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	peaceful	_	_
7	day	_	_
8	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	so	_	_
4	quiet	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	peaceful	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	beautiful	_	_
9	it	_	_
10	was	_	_
11	hard	_	_
12	to	_	_
13	believe	_	_
14	that	_	_
15	hunters	_	_
16	with	_	_
17	terrible	_	_
18	guns	_	_
19	were	_	_
20	searching	_	_
21	the	_	_
22	Green	_	_
23	Forest	_	_
24	for	_	_
25	beautiful	_	_
26	Lightfoot	_	_
27	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	they	_	_
3	were	_	_
4	,	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	Lightfoot	_	_
7	knew	_	_
8	that	_	_
9	sooner	_	1:OTH
10	or	_	1
11	later	_	1
12	one	_	_
13	of	_	_
14	them	_	_
15	would	_	_
16	be	_	2:OTH
17	sure	_	2
18	to	_	2
19	visit	_	_
20	Paddy	_	_
21	's	_	_
22	pond	_	_
23	.	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	though	_	_
4	he	_	_
5	rested	_	_
6	and	_	1:OTH
7	took	_	_
8	short	_	_
9	naps	_	_
10	all	_	1
11	through	_	_
12	that	_	1
13	beautiful	_	_
14	day	_	_
15	,	_	_
16	he	_	_
17	was	_	_
18	anxious	_	_
19	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	could	_	_
3	n't	_	_
4	help	_	_
5	but	_	_
6	be	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	next	_	_
3	morning	_	_
4	found	_	_
5	Lightfoot	_	_
6	back	_	_
7	in	_	1:OTH;2:OTH
8	the	_	1;2
9	same	_	2

11	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	this	_	_
3	morning	_	_
4	he	_	_
5	took	_	_
6	no	_	_
7	naps	_	_
8	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	rested	_	_
3	,	_	_
4	but	_	_
5	all	_	1:OTH;2:OTH
6	the	_	1;2
7	time	_	2
8	he	_	_
9	was	_	_
10	watchful	_	_
11	and	_	_
12	alert	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	A	_	_
2	feeling	_	_
3	of	_	_
4	uneasiness	_	_
5	possessed	_	_
6	him	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	felt	_	_
3	in	_	_
4	his	_	_
5	bones	_	_
6	that	_	_
7	danger	_	_
8	in	_	_
9	the	_	_

12	a	_	_
13	hunter	_	_
14	with	_	_
15	a	_	_
16	terrible	_	_
17	gun	_	_
18	was	_	_
19	not	_	_
20	far	_	_
21	distant	_	_
22	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	hours	_	_
4	slipped	_	_
5	away	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	little	_	_
9	by	_	_
10	little	_	_
11	he	_	_
12	grew	_	_
13	less	_	_
14	uneasy	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	began	_	_
3	to	_	_
4	hope	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	that	_	_
7	day	_	_
8	would	_	_

1	Then	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	now	_	_
3	Lightfoot	_	_
4	was	_	_

4	he	_	_
5	swam	_	_
6	rapidly	_	_
7	,	_	_
8	but	_	_
9	those	_	_

17	and	_	_
18	by	_	1:OTH
19	the	_	1

21	he	_	_
22	reached	_	_

25	of	_	_
26	the	_	_
27	Big	_	_
28	River	_	_
29	it	_	_
30	seemed	_	_
31	to	_	_
32	him	_	_
33	that	_	_

1	At	_	_
2	first	_	_
3	he	_	_

8	towards	_	_
9	a	_	1:OTH
10	clump	_	_
11	of	_	1
12	trees	_	_
13	he	_	_

19	bank	_	_
20	above	_	_
21	the	_	_
22	point	_	_
23	where	_	_
24	he	_	_
25	had	_	_
26	entered	_	_
27	the	_	_

29	,	_	_
30	but	_	_
31	to	_	_

34	he	_	_

36	to	_	_
37	swim	_	_
38	against	_	2:OTH
39	the	_	2
40	current	_	2
41	and	_	_
42	he	_	_
43	soon	_	_
44	found	_	_
45	that	_	_
46	he	_	_
47	had	_	_
48	n't	_	_
49	the	_	_

51	to	_	_
52	do	_	_
53	this	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	turned	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	headed	_	_
6	for	_	_
7	a	_	_

10	the	_	_
11	Big	_	_

1	This	_	_

6	,	_	_
7	for	_	_

15	him	_	_
16	.	_	_

1	Even	_	_
2	then	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	could	_	_
5	feel	_	_
6	his	_	_

8	leaving	_	_
9	him	_	_
10	.	_	_

1	Had	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	escaped	_	_
4	those	_	_
5	hounds	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	the	_	_

14	in	_	1
15	the	_	_

17	River	_	_
18	?	_	_

1	This	_	_
2	new	_	_
3	fear	_	_
4	gave	_	_
5	him	_	_
6	more	_	_
7	strength	_	_
8	for	_	1:OTH
9	a	_	1
10	little	_	_

1	Little	_	_

10	Lightfoot	_	_
11	the	_	_

1	He	_	_

14	--	_	_
15	well	_	_

17	it	_	_
18	was	_	_

1	Just	_	_
2	as	_	_
3	Lightfoot	_	_
4	felt	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	he	_	_
7	could	_	_
8	not	_	_
9	take	_	_
10	another	_	_
11	stroke	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	that	_	_
14	the	_	_
15	end	_	_
16	was	_	_
17	at	_	1:OTH
18	hand	_	1
19	,	_	_
20	one	_	_
21	foot	_	_
22	touched	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	all	_	_
4	four	_	_
5	feet	_	_
6	touched	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	A	_	_
2	second	_	_
3	later	_	_
4	he	_	_

7	solid	_	_
8	footing	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	was	_	_
11	standing	_	_
12	with	_	_
13	the	_	_
14	water	_	_
15	only	_	_
16	up	_	1:OTH
17	to	_	1
18	his	_	_
19	knees	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	found	_	_
4	a	_	_

1	With	_	_
2	a	_	_
3	little	_	_
4	gasp	_	_
5	of	_	_
6	returning	_	_
7	hope	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	Lightfoot	_	_
10	waded	_	_
11	along	_	_
12	until	_	_
13	the	_	_

15	began	_	_
16	to	_	_
17	grow	_	_
18	deeper	_	_
19	again	_	_
20	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	hoped	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	he	_	_
6	would	_	_
7	be	_	_
8	able	_	_
9	to	_	_
10	wade	_	_
11	ashore	_	_
12	,	_	_
13	but	_	_
14	he	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	for	_	_
3	a	_	_
4	long	_	_
5	time	_	_
6	he	_	_

1	He	_	_

20	that	_	_

1	Those	_	_
