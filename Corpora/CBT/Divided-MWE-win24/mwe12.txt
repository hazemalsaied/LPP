1	When	_	_

1	This	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	she	_	_
3	learnt	_	_
4	by	_	_

1	When	_	_

17	the	_	_

20	nestled	_	_
21	in	_	_

1	Now	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	fame	_	_

33	among	_	_
34	the	_	_

37	the	_	_
38	king	_	_
39	's	_	_
40	son	_	_
41	,	_	_
42	who	_	_
43	would	_	_

62	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	the	_	_
3	prince	_	_
4	admired	_	_
5	the	_	_

17	more	_	1:OTH
18	than	_	1

20	he	_	_
21	admired	_	_
22	the	_	_

24	and	_	_
25	courage	_	_
26	of	_	_
27	the	_	_

30	had	_	_
31	brought	_	_
32	them	_	_
33	there	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	he	_	_

4	home	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	told	_	_
7	his	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	the	_	_

16	and	_	_
17	wandered	_	_

21	asking	_	_

1	One	_	_

3	she	_	_

6	a	_	_
7	thatched	_	1:OTH

9	,	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	inquired	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	farmer	_	_
3	said	_	_
4	he	_	_
5	wanted	_	_
6	a	_	_

1	So	_	_
2	she	_	_
3	became	_	_
4	a	_	_
5	cowherd	_	_
6	.	_	_

1	One	_	_
2	morning	_	_
3	she	_	_

6	her	_	_
7	cows	_	_
8	through	_	_
9	the	_	_
10	meadows	_	_
11	when	_	_
12	she	_	_
13	heard	_	_
14	near	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	hastened	_	_
3	to	_	_

1	You	_	_

3	guess	_	_
4	how	_	_
5	frightened	_	_
6	she	_	_
7	was	_	_
8	!	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	the	_	_

11	,	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	the	_	_

1	When	_	_
