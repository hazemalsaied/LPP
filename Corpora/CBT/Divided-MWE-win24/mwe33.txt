1	Mary	_	_

7	that	_	_

10	never	_	_

13	``	_	_

15	,	_	_
16	''	_	_
17	seeming	_	_
18	to	_	1:OTH
19	think	_	_
20	it	_	1
21	reflected	_	_
22	some	_	_
23	slight	_	_
24	or	_	_
25	disparagement	_	_
26	upon	_	_
27	me	_	_
28	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	did	_	_
3	all	_	_
4	she	_	_
5	could	_	_
6	to	_	_
7	encourage	_	_
8	him	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	when	_	_
3	Hester	_	_
4	returned	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	found	_	_
7	out	_	_
8	about	_	_
9	Hugh	_	_
10	she	_	_
11	was	_	_
12	very	_	_
13	angry	_	_
14	--	_	_
15	and	_	_
16	grieved	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	which	_	_
19	hurt	_	_
20	me	_	_
21	far	_	_
22	more	_	_
23	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	told	_	_
3	me	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	I	_	_
6	had	_	_
7	forgotten	_	_
8	myself	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	that	_	_
11	Hugh	_	_
12	's	_	_
13	visits	_	_
14	must	_	_
15	cease	_	_
16	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	had	_	_
3	never	_	_
4	been	_	_
5	afraid	_	_
6	of	_	_
7	Hester	_	_
8	before	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	but	_	_
11	I	_	_
12	was	_	_
13	afraid	_	_
14	of	_	_
15	her	_	_
16	then	_	_
17	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	yielded	_	_
3	.	_	_

1	Perhaps	_	_
2	it	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	very	_	_
5	weak	_	_
6	of	_	_
7	me	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	but	_	_
10	then	_	_
11	I	_	_
12	was	_	_
13	always	_	_
14	weak	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	think	_	_
3	that	_	_
4	was	_	_
5	why	_	_
6	Hugh	_	_
7	's	_	_
8	strength	_	_
9	had	_	_
10	appealed	_	_
11	so	_	_
12	to	_	_
13	me	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	needed	_	_
3	love	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	protection	_	_
6	.	_	_

1	Hester	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	strong	_	_
4	and	_	_
5	self-sufficient	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	had	_	_
8	never	_	_
9	felt	_	_
10	such	_	1:OTH
11	a	_	1
12	need	_	_
13	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	could	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	understand	_	_
5	.	_	_

1	Oh	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	how	_	_
4	contemptuous	_	_
5	she	_	_
6	was	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	told	_	_
3	Hugh	_	_
4	timidly	_	_
5	that	_	_
6	Hester	_	_
7	did	_	_
8	not	_	_
9	approve	_	1:OTH
10	of	_	1
11	our	_	_
12	friendship	_	_
13	and	_	_
14	that	_	_
15	it	_	_
16	must	_	_
17	end	_	_
18	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	took	_	_
3	it	_	_
4	quietly	_	_
5	enough	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	went	_	_
9	away	_	_
10	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	thought	_	_
3	he	_	_
4	did	_	_
5	not	_	1:OTH
6	care	_	_
7	much	_	1
8	,	_	_
9	and	_	_
10	the	_	_
11	thought	_	_
12	selfishly	_	_
13	made	_	_
14	my	_	_
15	own	_	_
16	heartache	_	_
17	worse	_	_
18	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	very	_	_
4	unhappy	_	_
5	for	_	_
6	a	_	_
7	long	_	_
8	time	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	but	_	_
11	I	_	_
12	tried	_	_
13	not	_	_
14	to	_	_
15	let	_	_
16	Hester	_	_
17	see	_	_
18	it	_	_
19	,	_	_
20	and	_	_
21	I	_	_
22	do	_	_
23	n't	_	_
24	think	_	_
25	she	_	_
26	did	_	_
27	.	_	_

1	She	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	very	_	_
5	discerning	_	_
6	in	_	_
7	some	_	_
8	things	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	After	_	_
2	a	_	_
3	time	_	_
4	I	_	_
5	got	_	_
6	over	_	_
7	it	_	_
8	;	_	_
9	that	_	_
10	is	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	the	_	_
13	heartache	_	_
14	ceased	_	_
15	to	_	_
16	ache	_	_
17	all	_	1:OTH;2:OTH
18	the	_	1;2
19	time	_	2
20	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	things	_	_
3	were	_	_
4	never	_	_
5	quite	_	_
6	the	_	_
7	same	_	_
8	again	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	Life	_	_
2	always	_	_
3	seemed	_	_
4	rather	_	_
5	dreary	_	_
6	and	_	_
7	empty	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	in	_	1:OTH
10	spite	_	1
11	of	_	1
12	Hester	_	_
13	and	_	_
14	my	_	_
15	roses	_	_
16	and	_	_
17	my	_	_
18	Sunday-School	_	_
19	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	supposed	_	_
3	that	_	_
4	Hugh	_	_
5	Blair	_	_
6	would	_	_
7	find	_	_
8	him	_	_
9	a	_	_
10	wife	_	_
11	elsewhere	_	_
12	,	_	_
13	but	_	_
14	he	_	_
15	did	_	_
16	not	_	_
17	.	_	_

1	The	_	_
2	years	_	_
3	went	_	_
4	by	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	we	_	_
7	never	_	_
8	met	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	although	_	_
11	I	_	_
12	saw	_	_
13	him	_	_
14	often	_	_
15	at	_	_
16	church	_	_
17	.	_	_

1	At	_	_
2	such	_	_
3	times	_	_
4	Hester	_	_
5	always	_	_
6	watched	_	_
7	me	_	_
8	very	_	_
9	closely	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	but	_	_
12	there	_	_
13	was	_	_
14	no	_	_
15	need	_	_
16	of	_	_
17	her	_	_
18	to	_	1:OTH
19	do	_	1
20	so	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	Hugh	_	_
2	made	_	_
3	no	_	_
4	attempt	_	_
5	to	_	_
6	meet	_	_
7	me	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	or	_	_
10	speak	_	_
11	with	_	_
12	me	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	I	_	_
16	would	_	_
17	not	_	_
18	have	_	1:OTH
19	permitted	_	_
20	it	_	1
21	if	_	_
22	he	_	_
23	had	_	_
24	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	my	_	_
3	heart	_	_
4	always	_	_
5	yearned	_	_
6	after	_	_
7	him	_	_
8	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	selfishly	_	_
4	glad	_	_
5	he	_	_
6	had	_	_
7	not	_	_
8	married	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	because	_	_
11	if	_	_
12	he	_	_
13	had	_	_
14	I	_	_
15	could	_	_
16	not	_	_
17	have	_	_
18	thought	_	_
19	and	_	_
20	dreamed	_	_
21	of	_	_
22	him	_	_
23	--	_	_
24	it	_	_
25	would	_	_
26	have	_	_
27	been	_	_
28	wrong	_	_
29	.	_	_

1	Perhaps	_	_
2	,	_	_
3	as	_	_
4	it	_	_
5	was	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	it	_	_
8	was	_	_
9	foolish	_	_
10	;	_	_
11	but	_	_
12	it	_	_
13	seemed	_	_
14	to	_	_
15	me	_	_
16	that	_	_
17	I	_	_
18	must	_	_
19	have	_	_
20	something	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	if	_	1:OTH

27	to	_	_
28	fill	_	_
29	my	_	2:OTH
30	life	_	2

1	At	_	_
2	first	_	_
3	there	_	_
4	was	_	_
5	only	_	_
6	pain	_	_
7	in	_	_
8	the	_	_
9	thought	_	_
10	of	_	_

12	,	_	_
13	but	_	_
14	afterwards	_	_
15	a	_	_
16	faint	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	misty	_	_
19	little	_	_
20	pleasure	_	_
21	crept	_	_
22	in	_	_

1	Ten	_	_

6	.	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	then	_	_
3	Hester	_	_
4	died	_	_
5	.	_	_

1	Her	_	_
2	illness	_	_
3	was	_	_
4	sudden	_	_

6	short	_	_
7	;	_	_
8	but	_	_
9	,	_	_
10	before	_	_
11	she	_	_
12	died	_	_
13	,	_	_
14	she	_	_
15	asked	_	_

7	reawakened	_	_

1	I	_	_

7	to	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	there	_	_

11	give	_	_

14	deathbed	_	_
15	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	could	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	break	_	_
5	it	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	I	_	_
9	told	_	_
10	him	_	_
11	so	_	_
12	.	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	was	_	_
3	the	_	_

6	I	_	_
7	had	_	_
8	ever	_	_
9	done	_	_
10	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	did	_	_
3	not	_	_
4	go	_	1:OTH
5	away	_	1
6	quietly	_	_
7	this	_	_
8	time	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	He	_	_
2	pleaded	_	_
3	and	_	_
4	reasoned	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	reproached	_	_
7	.	_	_

1	Every	_	_
2	word	_	_
3	of	_	_
4	his	_	_
5	hurt	_	_
6	me	_	_
7	like	_	_
8	a	_	_
9	knife-thrust	_	_
10	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	could	_	_
4	not	_	_
5	break	_	_

1	If	_	_
2	Hester	_	_

12	and	_	_
13	her	_	_
14	estrangement	_	_
15	and	_	_
16	gone	_	_

18	him	_	_
19	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	she	_	_

6	I	_	_
7	could	_	_
8	not	_	_
9	do	_	_
10	it	_	_
11	.	_	_

1	Finally	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	went	_	_
4	away	_	_
5	in	_	_
6	grief	_	_
7	and	_	_
8	anger	_	_
9	.	_	_

1	That	_	_

7	and	_	_
8	now	_	_
9	I	_	_
10	sat	_	_
11	alone	_	_
12	in	_	_
13	the	_	_
14	moonlit	_	_
15	rose-garden	_	_
16	and	_	_
17	wept	_	_
18	for	_	_

20	.	_	_

1	But	_	_
2	after	_	_
3	a	_	_

5	my	_	_

7	dried	_	_
8	and	_	_
9	a	_	_
10	very	_	_

13	came	_	_
14	over	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	felt	_	_
3	calm	_	_

5	happy	_	_
6	,	_	_
7	as	_	_

4	the	_	_

1	Further	_	_

1	In	_	_

1	It	_	_
2	wore	_	_

1	Often	_	_
2	in	_	_

4	Hester	_	_

15	but	_	_
16	always	_	_

1	This	_	_
2	was	_	_

7	I	_	_

17	I	_	_
18	only	_	_

8	``	_	_
