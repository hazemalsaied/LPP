1	He	_	_

1	This	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	nearly	_	_
3	fell	_	_

8	,	_	_
9	for	_	_
10	he	_	_
11	was	_	_
12	also	_	_
13	looking	_	_
14	through	_	_
15	a	_	_
16	spyglass	_	_
17	straight	_	_
18	at	_	_
19	me	_	_
20	,	_	_
21	too	_	_
22	,	_	_
23	it	_	_
24	seemed	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	How	_	_
2	foolish	_	_
3	I	_	_
4	felt	_	_
5	!	_	_

1	And	_	_
2	yet	_	_
3	my	_	_
4	curiosity	_	_
5	was	_	_
6	so	_	2:OTH
7	strong	_	_
8	that	_	2
9	a	_	1:OTH
10	few	_	1
11	minutes	_	_
12	afterward	_	_
13	I	_	_
14	peeped	_	_
15	back	_	_
16	again	_	_
17	,	_	_
18	just	_	_
19	to	_	_
20	see	_	_
21	what	_	_
22	he	_	_
23	was	_	_
24	doing	_	_
25	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	he	_	_
3	coolly	_	_
4	laid	_	_
5	down	_	_
6	his	_	_
7	glass	_	_
8	,	_	_
9	rose	_	_
10	,	_	_
11	lifted	_	_
12	his	_	_
13	cap	_	_
14	and	_	_
15	bowed	_	_
16	politely	_	_
17	to	_	_
18	me	_	_
19	--	_	_
20	or	_	_
21	,	_	_
22	at	_	1:OTH
23	least	_	1
24	,	_	_
25	in	_	_
26	my	_	_
27	direction	_	_
28	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	dropped	_	_
3	my	_	_
4	glass	_	_
5	and	_	_
6	smiled	_	_
7	in	_	_
8	a	_	1:OTH
9	mixture	_	_
10	of	_	1
11	dismay	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	amusement	_	_
14	.	_	_

1	Then	_	_
2	I	_	_
3	remembered	_	_
4	that	_	_
5	he	_	_
6	was	_	_
7	probably	_	_
8	watching	_	_
9	me	_	_
10	again	_	_
11	,	_	_
12	and	_	_
13	might	_	_

18	meant	_	_
19	for	_	_
20	him	_	_
21	.	_	_

1	I	_	_
2	banished	_	_
3	it	_	_
4	immediately	_	_
5	,	_	_
6	shut	_	_
7	my	_	_

9	up	_	_
10	and	_	_
11	did	_	_
12	not	_	_
13	touch	_	_
14	it	_	_
15	again	_	_
16	.	_	_

1	Soon	_	_
