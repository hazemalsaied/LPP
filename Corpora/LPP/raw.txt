once  when i was six years old  i saw a magnificent picture in a book about the primeval forest called  reallife stories
it showed a boa constrictor swallowing a wild animal
here is a copy of the drawing
it said in the book   boa constrictors swallow their prey whole  without chewing
then they are not able to move  and they sleep for the six months it takes for digestion
so i thought a lot about the adventures of the jungle and  in turn  i managed  with a coloured pencil  to make my first drawing
my drawing no 1
it looked like this  i showed my masterpiece to the grownups and i asked them if my drawing frightened them
they answered me   why would anyone be frightened by a hat
my drawing was not of a hat
it showed a boa constrictor digesting an elephant
i then drew the inside of the boa constrictor  so that the grownups could understand
they always need to have things explained
my drawing no 2 looked like this  the grownups advised me to leave aside drawings of boa constrictors  open or closed  and to apply myself instead to geography  history  arithmetic and grammar
thus i abandoned  at the age of six  a magnificent career as a painter
i was discouraged by the failure of my drawing no 1 and of my drawing no 2
grownups never understand anything by themselves  and it s tiresome for children to always explain things for them again and again
so i had to choose another profession  and i learned to fly airplanes
i flew a little in many places around the world
and geography  it s true  has served me well
i could recognize  at first glance  china from arizona
it s very useful if you get lost at night
i have had  during my life  a lot of contact with many persons of consequence
i have lived a lot amongst the grownups
i have seen them from close up
it has nt much improved my opinion of them
whenever i met one of them that seemed a bit more clearsighted  i tried the experiment of showing them my drawing no 1  that i ve always kept
i wanted to know if they were really a person of true understanding
but they always responded   it s a hat
so i would never speak to them of boa constrictors  nor of primeval forests  nor of the stars
i put myself at their level
i talked to them about bridge  golf  politics and neckties
and the grownup was glad to know such a sensible man
so i lived alone  without anyone i could really talk to  until a breakdown in the sahara desert  six years ago
something had broken in my engine
and as i had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers  i readied myself to try and carry out  all alone  the difficult repairs
for me it was a matter of life or death
i had hardly enough water to drink for a week
the first night i went to sleep on the sand  a thousand miles from any human habitation
i was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean
so you can imagine my surprise when at daybreak  a funny little voice woke me up
it said   please  draw me a sheep
what
draw me a sheep
i jumped to my feet as if i d been struck by lightning
i rubbed my eyes
i took a good look around me
and i saw a quite extraordinary little man  who was examining me seriously
here is the best portrait that  later  i managed to do of him
but my drawing  of course  is much less charming than its model
it s not my fault
i was discouraged in my career as a painter by the grownups  at the age of six  and i had nt learned to draw anything except boa constrictors  closed and open
i stared at this sudden apparition wide eyed with astonishment
remember that i was a thousand miles from any inhabited region
and yet this little fellow seemed neither lost  nor halfdead with fatigue  nor starved or dying of thirst or fear
he looked nothing like a child lost in the middle of the desert  a thousand miles from any inhabited region
when i finally managed to speak  i said   but  what are you doing here
and he repeated  very slowly  as if it was something very serious   please  draw me a sheep   when a mystery is too overpowering  one dare not disobey
absurd as it seemed to me a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death  i took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and a pen
but then i remembered that i had mainly studied geigraphy  history  arithmetic and grammar  and i told the little fellow lrb a little crossly rrb that i did nt know how to draw
he replied   it does nt matter
draw me a sheep
as i d never drawn a sheep  i redrew for him one of the only two drawings that i was capable of
the one of the closed boa constrictor
and i was astounded to hear the little fellow respond   no
no
i do nt want an elephant inside a boa constrictor
a boa constrictor is very dangerous  and an elephant is very cumbersome
where i live everything is very small
i need a sheep
draw me a sheep
so i drew
he looked carefully  then said   no
this one s already very sick
make another one
i drew again  my friend smiled gently and indulgently   you can see yourself  this is nt a sheep  it s a ram
it has horns   so once again i redid my drawing  but it was rejected  like the previous ones   this one s too old
i want a sheep that will live a long time
so  getting impatient  as i was eager to start dismantling my engine  i hastily sketched this drawing  and i snapped   this here is the box
the sheep you want is inside
but i was very surprised to see the face of my young judge light up   it s exactly the way i wanted
do you think this sheep needs a lot of grass
why
because where i m from everything is very small    there will certainly be enough
i gave you a very small sheep
he leaned his head towards the drawing   not that small  look
he s fallen asleep   and that s how i met the little prince
chapter iii it took me a long time to find out where he came from
the little prince  who asked me many questions  never seemed to hear my own
it was the words spoken by chance that  little by little  revealed everything to me
so  when he saw my airplane for the first time lrb i wo nt draw my airplane  it would be a drawing far too complicated for me rrb  he asked me   what s that thing there
it s not a thing
it flies
it s an airplane
it s my airplane
and i was proud to have him know that i could fly
then he cried   what
you fell from the sky
yes   i said modestly
oh
that s funny
and the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter  which irritated me very much
i prefer people to take my misfortunes seriously
then he added   so  you also come from the sky
what planet are you from
i caught a glimpse into the mystery of his presence  and i asked abruptly   so you come from another planet then
but he did nt answer
he shook his head slowly whilst looking at my airplane   it s true that you ca nt have come from far away in that thing   and he drifted into a daydream which lasted a long while
then  taking my sheep out of his pocket  he sank himself into the contemplation of his treasure
you can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this small disclosure about  the other planets
so i tried to find out more   where are you from my little fellow
where s this  where i live  of yours
where do you take my sheep off to
after a reflective silence he answered   what s good about the box you ve given me is that at night  he can use it as a house
that s right
and if you re good  i ll give you a rope to tie him up with during the day
and a stake
the offer seemed to shock the little prince   tie him up
what a funny idea
but if you do nt tie him up  he ll wander off  and get lost
my friend broke into another peal of laughter   where do you think he d go
anywhere
straight ahead   then the little prince said gravely   that does nt matter  where i live  everything is so small
and perhaps with a hint of sadness  he added   straight ahead you ca nt go far
i thus learned a second very important thing  that his home planet was barely bigger than a house
it did nt surprise me much
i knew that  apart from the large planets like the earth  jupiter  mars  and venus  which have been given names  there are hundreds of others that are sometimes so small that one has great difficulty in spotting them through the telescope
when an astronomer discovers one of these  he gives it a number for as name
he might call it for example  asteroid 325
i have serious reason to believe that the planet from where the little prince came is the asteroid b612
this asteroid has only been seen through a telescope once  in 1909  by a turkish astronomer
he had then given a big presentation on his discovery at an international astronomy conference
but nobody had believed him because of his outfit
grownups are like that
fortunately for the reputation of asteroid b612  a turkish dictator imposed on his people  on pain of death  to dress themselves in the european fashion
the astronomer gave his presentation again in 1920  dressed very stylishly
and this time everybody believed him
if i have told you these details about the asteroid b612  and revealed to you its number  it s because of the grownups
grownups love numbers
when you talk to them about a new friend  they never ask you about any of the important things
they never ask you   how does his voice sound
what games does he like best
does he collect butterflies
they ask   how old is he
how many brothers does he have
how much does he weigh
how much money does his father make
only then do they think they know him
if you said to the grownups   i saw a beautiful red brick house with geraniums by the windows and doves on the roof    they would nt be able to picture this house in their minds
you d have to tell them   i saw a hundred thousand franc house
and they d cry   how pretty
so if you were to say to them   the proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming  he laughed  and he wanted a sheep
if someone wants a sheep  that proves they exist   they d shrug their shoulders and treat you like a child
but if you were to say   the planet he came from is the asteroid b612   they d be convinced  and leave you in peace and spare you their questions
they re like that
do nt blame them
children should be forgiving towards the grownups
but  of course  those of us who understand life  we do nt much care for numbers
i d have liked to begin this story in the same way as a fairy tale
i d have liked to say   once upon a time  there was a little prince who lived on a planet not much bigger than himself  and who needed a friend   for those who understand life  it would have seemed much more natural
for i do nt want my book to be read lightly
i feel so much sadness in recounting these memories
it s already been six years since my friend left with his sheep
if i try to describe him here  it s so as not to forget him
it s sad to forget a friend
not everyone has had a friend
and if i forgot him  i could become like the grownups who are only interested in numbers
so that s why i have again bought a box of paints and some pencils
it s hard to take up drawing again at my age  when i have only ever attempted to draw a boa constrictor  closed and open  at the age of six
i ll try  of course  to make my portraits as lifelike as possible
but i m not quite sure i ll succeed
some drawings go alright  others do nt look like their subjects
i also get the size a bit wrong
here the little prince is too big
there he s too small
i m also not sure about the colour of his outfit
so i fumble along somehow  as best i can
i will make mistakes on certain important points too
but you ll have to forgive me that
my friend never gave explanations
perhaps he thought i was just like himself
but i  unfortunately  do nt know how to see sheep through boxes
perhaps i m a bit like the grownups
i must have got older
every day i d learn something about his planet  the departure  and the trip
the information came slowly  as his thoughts wandered
it was in this way that  on the third day  i came to know of the tragedy of the baobabs
this time again it was thanks to the sheep  because the little prince asked me abruptly  as if seized by a grave doubt   it s true  is nt it  that sheep eat shrubs
yes
it s true
oh
i am glad
i did nt understand why it was so important that sheep eat shrubs
but the little prince added   then it follows they also eat baobabs
i pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not shrubs  but trees as big as churches  and that even if he took with him a whole herd of elephants  the herd would nt manage to eat up one single baobab
the idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh   they d have to be piled up on top of each other   but he remarked wisely   the baobab trees  before they grow up  start off small
that s right
but why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs
he replied   oh  come on
as if it were obvious
and it took me a great mental effort to understand this problem on my own  without any help
and indeed  on the planet of the little prince there were  like on all planets  both good plants and bad plants
and therefore  both good seeds from good plants and bad seeds from bad plants
but seeds are invisible
they sleep secretly deep in the earth until  on a whim  one of them decides to wake up
then it elongates and grows  timidly at first  toward the sun  a charming little harmless sprig
if it s a sprig of radish or rose bush  you can let it grow as it likes
but if it s a bad plant  one must pull the plant out straight away  as soon as it can be recognised
now there were some terrible seeds on the planet of the little prince  there were the seeds of baobab trees
the soil of the planet was infested with them
a baobab  if you get to it too late  can never be got rid of
it takes over the entire planet
it pierces it with its roots
and if the planet is too small  and if there are too many baobabs  they shatter it to pieces
it s a matter of discipline   the little prince told me later
after grooming oneself in the morning  the planet must be carefully groomed
you must see to it that you regularly pull out the baobabs as soon as they can be told apart from the rose bushes  to which they look very similar when they re very young
it s a very boring job  but very easy
and one day he suggested that i apply myself to making a beautiful drawing  so that the children from where i came from would understand all this
if one day they travel   he said to me   it could come in useful
sometimes there s no harm in postponing one s work
but in the case of baobabs  that always leads to a catastrophe
i used to know a planet inhabited by a lazy man
he had neglected three little bushes   and based on what the little prince told me  i drew this planet
i do nt like to sound like a moralist
but the danger of the baobabs is so little understood  and the risks run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid are so large that  for once  i am breaking my normal reserve
i say   children
beware of baobabs
it s to warn my friends of the danger they ve long been skirting  like myself  without knowing it  that i have worked so hard on this drawing
the lesson which i pass on by this means was worth the effort
you might be wondering  why is it that in this book there are nt any other drawings as impressive as the drawing of the baobabs
the answer is simple  i tried but i could nt succeed
when i drew the baobabs i was spurred on by a sense of urgency
oh
little prince  i came to understand  gradually  in this way  your sad life
for a long time your only entertainment was the softness of the sunsets
i learned this new detail on the fourth day  in the morning  when you said to me   i m very fond of sunsets
let s go and see a sunset now    but we have to wait    wait for what
wait until the sun goes down
you seemed surprised at first  and then you chuckled at yourself
and you said   i think myself at home still
indeed
when it s noon in the united states  the sun  everybody knows  is setting over france
it would suffice to be able to go to france in one minute to be able see a sunset
unfortunately  france is much too far away
but on your tiny planet  all you needed was to move your chair a few steps
and you watched the twilight falling whenever you liked  one day i saw the sunset fortyfour times
and a little later you added   you know  you love the sunset  when you re really sad    the day you saw it fortyfour times  were you were really that sad then
but the little prince made no reply
on the fifth day  again thanks to the sheep  this secret of the little prince s life was revealed to me
he asked abruptly  without anything leading up to it  as if it was the result of a long silent meditation on a problem   if a sheep eats shrubs  then does it eat flowers too   a sheep eats everything it finds
even flowers that have thorns
yes  even flowers that have thorns
what are the thorns for then
i did nt know the answer
i was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt in my engine that had got stuck
i was very worried because my breakdown was beginning to appear to be very serious  and i had so little drinking water left that i had to fear the worst
what are the thorns for then
the little prince never let go of a question  once he had asked it
i was upset over the bolt and i said the first thing that came into my head   the thorns are of no use at all
flowers have thorns just for spite
oh
but after a moment of silence  he exclaimed with a sort of resentment   i do nt believe you
flowers are weak creatures
they re naive
they reassure themselves as best they can
they think themselves frightful with their thorns   i made no reply
at that moment i was thinking to myself   if this bolt wo nt budge  i ll knock it out with a hammer
the little prince interrupted my thoughts again   and you actually believe that flowers    no
no
i do nt believe it at all
i answered the first thing that came to my mind
i  myself  am busy with matters of consequence
he looked at me dumbfounded
matters of consequence
he watched me  hammer in hand and my fingers black with grease  leaning on an object that would have seemed to him very ugly
you talk just like the grownups
that made me feel a little ashamed
but he went on relentlessly   you confuse everything  you mix everything up
he was really very angry
he shook his golden curls in the breeze   i know a planet where there is a redfaced gentleman
he has never smelled a flower
he has never looked at a star
he has never loved anyone
he has never done anything but sums
and all day long he repeats just like you   i am busy with matters of consequence
and that makes him swell up with pride
but this is not a man  he s a mushroom
a what
a mushroom
the little prince was now white with rage
flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years
for millions of years  the sheep have eaten the flowers all the same
and it s not a matter of consequence to try to understand why they take so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use
is the war between flowers and sheep not important
is it not of more consequence and more important than the sums of a fat redfaced gentleman
and if i myself know of a unique flower  which grows nowhere but on my planet  that a little sheep can destroy in one stroke  just like that  one morning  without realising what he s done  is that not important
he blushed  and continued   if someone loves a flower of which just one specimen exists amongst the millions and millions of stars  it s enough to make him happy when he looks at them
he can say   my flower is out there somewhere   but if the sheep eats the flower  for him it s as if suddenly all the stars have gone out
and you think that s not important
he could nt say anything more
he suddenly burst into tears
night had fallen
i had put down my tools
of what moment was my hammer  my bolt  or thirst  or death
there was on a star  on a planet  my planet  earth  a little prince to be comforted
i took him in my arms
i rocked him
i said   the flower that you love is nt in danger  i ll draw you a muzzle for your sheep  i ll draw you a railing for your flower  i
i was nt sure what to say
i felt very awkward
i did nt know how to reach him  where to find him  it s so secretive  the land of tears
i learned very quickly to know this flower better
there had always been very simple flowers on the planet of the little prince  decorated with a single row of petals  that did nt take up any space  and did nt bother anyone
they would appear one morning in the grass  and by evening they d have faded away
but this one had sprouted one day  from a seed blown in from no one knows where  and the little prince had watched very closely this sprout that was not like the other sprouts
it could have been a new kind of baobab
but the shrub soon stopped growing and began to produce a flower
the little prince  who witnessed the appearance of a huge bud  felt that a miraculous apparition must emerge from it  but the flower never stopped preparing for her future beauty  safe in her green chamber
she chose her colours carefully
she dressed slowly  she arranged her petals one by one
she did not want to come out all rumpled  like the poppies
she would only want to appear in the full radiance of her beauty
oh yes
she was a very flirtatious creature
and her mysterious adornment had thus lasted for days and days
then one morning  exactly at sunrise  she suddenly showed herself
and  after having worked with such care and attention to detail  she said with a yawn   oh
i have only just woken up  i do apologize  i am not yet presentable  the little prince could nt restrain his admiration   you re so beautiful
am i not
the flower responded  sweetly
and i was born at the same moment as the sun   the little prince guessed easily enough that she was not very modest  but how moving she was
it s time  i think  for breakfast   she added an instant later   if you would have the kindness to think of my needs
and the little prince  completely abashed  having gone to look for a sprinkling can of fresh water  tended to the flower
and like that  she had soon begun to torment him with her vanity
one day  for example  speaking of her four thorns  she told the little prince   let them come  the tigers  with their claws
there are nt any tigers on my planet   the little prince objected   and tigers do nt eat weeds
i am not a weed   the flower replied sweetly
please forgive me   i do not fear tigers  but i detest drafts
you would nt happen to have a screen
detests drafts  that s bad luck for a plant   remarked the little prince
what a very complicated flower
in the evening you will put me under a glass dome
it is very cold where you live
where i come from   but she interrupted herself
she had come in the form of a seed
she could nt have known anything of other worlds
humiliated at having been caught out on a lie so naive  she coughed two or three times to imply the little prince was in the wrong
the screen
i was just going to look for it when you spoke to me
then she forced a cough to inflict still more remorse
so the little prince  despite the good will of his love  had soon come to doubt her
he had taken seriously words of no importance  and had become very unhappy
i should nt have listened to her   he told me one day   you should never listen to the flowers
we must look at them and breathe their fragrance
mine perfumed my whole planet  but i did nt know how to take pleasure in it
this business of the claws  which annoyed me so much  should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity  he continued his confidences   i did nt know how to understand
i should have her judged by her deeds and not by her words
she overwhelmed me with her fragrance and light
i should never have run away
i should have seen the tenderness behind her contrivances
flowers are so contradictory
but i was too young to know how to love her
i think that for his escape he took advantage of a migration of a flock of wild birds
on the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order
he carefully swept out his active volcanoes
he owned two active volcanoes  it was very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning
he also owned an extinct volcano
but  as he used to say   you never know
so he cleaned out the extinct volcano  too
if they are well cleaned out  volcanoes burn slowly and steadily  without any eruptions
volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney
on our earth we re obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes
that s why they cause us no end of trouble
the little prince also pulled up  with a hint of sadness  the last little shoots of the baobabs
he believed he would never return
but all these familiar tasks seemed  on that morning  very precious
and as he watered the flower one last time  and prepared to shelter her under her dome  he found himself close to tears
goodbye   he said to the flower
but she did nt answer
goodbye   he said again
the flower coughed
but it was not because she had a cold
i was silly   she said finally
i ask your forgiveness
try to be happy
he was surprised by this absence of reproaches
he stood there all bewildered  the dome held in midair
he did nt understand this quiet sweetness
of course i love you   the flower said to him
it s my fault that you did nt know
that is of no importance
but you have been just as foolish as i have
try to be happy  let the dome be
i do not want it anymore
but the wind    my cold is not all that bad  the cool night air will do me good
i am a flower
but the animals    i will have to endure two or three caterpillars if i wish to become acquainted with the butterflies
it seems that they are very beautiful
and otherwise who else will come to visit me
you will be far away
as for the large animals  i am not at all afraid of anything
i have my claws
and  naively  she showed her four thorns
then she added   do nt linger like this  it s tiresome
you have decided to leave
now go
for she did not want him to see her crying
she was such a proud flower
he found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325  326  327  328  329  and 330
so he began by visiting them to learn more
the first one was inhabited by a king
the king was sitting  dressed in purple and ermine  on a very simple yet majestic throne
ah
here comes a subject   exclaimed the king  when he caught sight of the little prince
and the little prince asked himself   how could he recognise me when he s never seen me before
he did nt know that for kings  the world is very much simplified
to them  all men are subjects
approach  so that i may see you better   said the king  who was very proud to finally be king over somebody
the little prince looked around him for a place to sit  but the planet was completely taken over by the magnificent ermine robe
so he remained standing  and  since he was tired  he yawned
it is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king   the monarch said to him
i forbid you to do so
i ca nt stop myself   replied the little prince  thoroughly embarrassed
ive come on a long journey  and i have nt slept    ah  then   the king said
i order you to yawn
i have not seen anyone yawning for years
yawns  to me  are objects of curiosity
come  now
yawn again
it is an order
that frightens me  i ca nt any more   said the little prince  blushing
hum
hum
replied the king
then i  i order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to   he sputtered a bit  and seemed vexed
for the king fundamentally insisted that his authority be respected
he did nt tolerate disobedience
he was an absolute monarch
but  because he was good at heart  he gave reasonable orders
if i ordered a general   he would often say   if i ordered a general to change himself into a seabird  and if the general did not obey me  it would not be the general s fault
it would be my fault
may i sit down
the little prince enquired timidly
i order you to sit down   replied the king  who majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle
but the little prince was astonished
the planet was tiny
over what could this king really rule
sire   he said to him   excuse my asking you a question    i order you to ask me a question   hastened to say the king
sire  over what do you rule
over everything   said the king  with a magnificent simplicity
over everything
the king made a subtle gesture  pointing out his planet  the other planets and the stars
over all that
asked the little prince
over all that   the king answered
for his rule was not only absolute  it was also universal
and the stars obey you
of course   the king said
they obey instantly
i do not tolerate insubordination
such power filled the little prince with wonder
if he had held it himself  he would ve been able to watch  not fortyfour  but seventytwo  or even a hundred  or even two hundred sunsets on the same day  without ever having to move his chair
and as he felt a bit sad as he remembered his forsaken little planet  he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favour   i d like to see a sunset  do that for me  order the sun to set    if i ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly  or to write a tragic drama  or to change himself into a sea bird  and if the general did not carry out the order received  which one of us would be in the wrong
you   said the little prince firmly
exactly
one must ask of each person that which they can give   the king went on
authority is based above all on reason
if you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea  they would rise up in revolution
i have the right to demand obedience because my orders are reasonable
then my sunset
the little prince reminded him  who never forgot a question once he had asked it
you shall have your sunset
i shall command it
but i shall wait  according to my science of government  until conditions are favourable
when will that be
inquired the little prince
hum
hum
replied the king  who consulted a bulky almanac
hum
hum
that will be about  about  that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight
and you will see how well i am obeyed
the little prince yawned
he was regretting his lost sunset
and then he was already getting a little bored
i ve nothing more to do here   he said to the king
i ll set off
do not go   said the king  who was very proud of having a subject
do not go
i will make you a minister
minister of what
minster of  of justice
but there s nobody here to judge
we do not know that   the king said to him
i have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom
i am very old  i have no space for a carriage and it tires me to walk
oh  but i ve already looked
said the little prince  who leant over to give one more glance at the other side of the planet
there was no one there either   then you shall judge yourself   the king answered
that is the most difficult thing of all
it is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge someone else
if you succeed in judging yourself rightly  then you are truly wise
yes   said the little prince   but i can judge myself anywhere
i do nt have to live here
hum
hum
said the king
i am fairly certain that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat
i hear him at night
you can judge this old rat
from time to time you will condemn him to death
thus his life will depend on your justice
but you will pardon him on each occasion to conserve him
there is only one of him
i   replied the little prince   do nt like to condemn anyone to death  and now i think i ll go on my way
no   said the king
but the little prince  having readied himself to leave  had no wish to grieve the old monarch
if your majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed  he should be able to give me a reasonable order
he should be able  for example  to order me to leave within a minute
it seems to me that conditions are favourable   as the king made no answer  the little prince hesitated at first  then  with a sigh  took his leave
i make you my ambassador   the king hastily called out
he had a magnificent air of authority
the grownups are very strange   the little prince said to himself  as he continued on his journey
the second planet was inhabited by a conceited man
ah
here comes a visit from an admirer
exclaimed the conceited man from afar  the moment he spotted the little prince
because  to conceited men  all other men are admirers
good morning   said the little prince
you have a funny hat
it s for saluting   the conceited man replied
it s to raise in salute when people acclaim me
unfortunately  nobody ever passes by this way
oh  really
said the little prince  who did nt understand
clap your hands  one against the other   the conceited man advised
the little prince clapped his hands  one against the other
the conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute
this is more fun than the visit to the king   the little prince said to himself
and he began again to clap his hands  one against the other
the conceited man again raised his hat in a salute
after five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the monotony of the game   and what should i do   he asked   to make the hat come down
but the conceited man did nt hear him
conceited people never hear anything but praise
do you really admire me a lot
he asked the little prince
what does that mean   to admire
to admire  means  to recognise that i m the most handsome  the bestdressed  the richest  and the most intelligent man on the planet
but you re the only man on your planet
do it for me
admire me just the same
i admire you   said the little prince  shrugging his shoulders a little   but how can that interest you so much
and the little prince went away
the grownups are certainly very odd   he said to himself  as he continued his journey
the next planet was inhabited by a heavy drinker
this was a very short visit  but it plunged the little prince into a deep sadness
what are you doing there
he said to the drinker  who he found sitting in silence in front of a number of empty bottles and a number of full bottles
i m drinking   replied the drinker  gloomily
why are you drinking
the little prince asked him
to forget   replied the drinker
to forget what
asked the little prince  who already felt sorry for him
to forget that i m ashamed   confessed the drinker  lowering his head
ashamed of what
inquired the little prince  who wanted to help him
ashamed of drinking
concluded the drinker  who then shut himself away in the silence
and the little prince went away  puzzled
the grownups are certainly very  very odd   he said to himself  as he continued on his journey
the fourth planet belonged to a businessman
this man was so busy that he did nt even raise his head when the little prince arrived
good morning   the little prince said to him
your cigarette has gone out
three and two make five
five and seven make twelve
twelve and three make fifteen
good morning
fifteen and seven make twentytwo
twentytwo and six make twentyeight
no time to light it again
twentysix and five make thirtyone
phew
then that makes fivehundredandone million  sixhundredtwentytwothousand  sevenhundredthirtyone
five hundred million what
huh
are you still there
fivehundredandone million  i ve forgotten now  i have so much work
i am a man of consequence
i do nt amuse myself with balderdash
two and five make seven
fivehundredandone million what
repeated the little prince  who had never in his life let go of a question  once he had asked it
the businessman raised his head
during the fiftyfour years that i ve lived on this planet  i ve only been disturbed three times
the first time was twentytwo years ago  by some scatterbrain who fell from god knows where
he made the most dreadful noise  and i made four mistakes in a sum
the second time was eleven years ago  by an attack of rheumatism
i do nt get enough exercise
i do nt have time to stroll about
i am a man of consequence
the third time  well  this is it
i was saying  then  fivehundredandone million    millions of what
the businessman realised that there was no hope of being left in peace   millions of those little objects that you see sometimes in the sky
flies
no  no  the little things that shine
bees
no  no
the little golden things that make lazy men daydream
as for me  i am a man of consequence
i have no time to daydream
ah
the stars
yes  that s it
the stars
and what do you do with fivehundred million stars
fivehundredandone million  sixhundredtwentytwo thousand  sevenhundredthirtyone
i am a man of consequence  i am precise
and what do you do with these stars
what do i do with them
yes
nothing
i own them
you own the stars
yes
but i ve already seen a king who    kings do nt own  they  reign  over
it s very different
and how does owning the stars help you
it helps by making me rich
and how does being rich help you
to buy more stars  if someone discovers some more
this man   the little prince said to himself   reasons a bit like my poor drinker   but he still had some questions   how can you own the stars
who owns them
the businessman retorted  grumpily
i do nt know
nobody does
then they belong to me  because i thought of it first
is that all that s necessary
certainly
when you find a diamond that belongs to nobody  it s yours
when you discover an island that belongs to nobody  it s yours
when you get an idea first  you take out a patent  it s yours
and i own the stars  because no one before me ever thought of owning them
yes  that s true   said the little prince
and what do you do with them
i administer them
i count them and recount them   said the businessman
it s difficult
but i am a man of consequence
the little prince was still not satisfied
if i owned a scarf  i could put it around my neck and take it away with me
if i owned a flower  i could pick my flower and take it away with me
but you ca nt pick the stars
no
but i can put them in the bank
what does that mean
that means that i write the number of my stars on a little paper
and then i lock this paper in a draw
and that s all
that s enough
that s funny   thought the little prince
it s rather poetic
but it s of no great consequence
on matters of consequence  the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grownups
i myself   he continued   own a flower that i water every day
i own three volcanoes  that i sweep out every week  as i also sweep out the one that s extinct
you never know
it s of some use to my volcanoes  and it s of some use to my flower  that i own them
but you re of no use to the stars   the businessman opened his mouth  but he found nothing to say in response  and the little prince went away
the grownups are certainly altogether extraordinary   he said to himself  as he continued on the journey
the fifth planet was very strange
it was the smallest of them all
there was just enough room on it to accommodate a street lamp and a lamplighter
the little prince could nt work out the purpose of having a street lamp and a lamplighter  somewhere out in the skies  on a planet without any houses or people
he said to himself nevertheless   it may well be that this man is absurd
but  he s less absurd than the king  than the conceited man  the businessman  or the drinker
at least his work has some meaning
when he lights his lamp  it s as if he s bringing to life one more star  or one more flower
when he puts out his lamp  he sends the flower  or the star  to sleep
that s a beautiful occupation
it serves a real purpose  because it s pretty
when he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter
good morning
why have you just put out your lamp
those are the orders   replied the lamplighter
good morning
what are the orders
that i put out my lamp
good evening
and he lit it again
but why have you just lit it again
those are the orders   replied the lamplighter
i do nt understand   said the little prince
there s nothing to understand   said the lamplighter
orders are orders
good morning
and he put out his lamp
then he sponged his forehead with a handkerchief  decorated with red squares
i have a terrible profession
in the old days it was reasonable
i d put the lamp out in the morning  and in the evening i d light it
i had the rest of the day to rest  and the rest of the night to sleep    and since then  have the orders changed
the orders have nt changed   said the lamplighter
that s the tragedy
every year the planet has turned faster and faster  and the orders have nt changed
so what then
said the little prince
so now that it spins round once every minute  i no longer have a moment s rest
once every minute i light the lamp and put it out again
that s funny
where you live  a day only lasts a minute
it s not funny at all
said the lamplighter
we ve already been speaking for a month
a month
yes
thirty minutes
thirty days
good evening
and he lit his lamp again
the little prince watched him and felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders
he remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek in the past  by moving his chair
he wanted to help his friend
you know  i know a way you can rest whenever you want    i always want to   said the lamplighter
for it s possible to be both faithful and lazy at the same time
the little prince went on   your planet is so small that you can go right round it in three strides
you only have to walk along rather slowly to always stay in the sun
when you want to rest  you can walk  and the day will last as long as you like
that does nt do me much good   said the lamplighter
what i really love in life is to sleep
that s bad luck   said the little prince
that is bad luck   said the lamplighter
good morning
and he put out his lamp
that man   said the little prince to himself  as he continued further on his journey   that man would be despised by all the others  by the king  by the conceited man  by the drinker  and by the businessman
yet he s the only one that does nt seem ridiculous to me
perhaps it s because he thinks of something other than himself
he breathed a sigh of regret  and said to himself   that man is the only one with who i could ve made friends
but his planet is really very small
there s no room on it for two people
what the little prince did nt dare admit to himself was that he missed this blessed planet most of all because of the 1440 sunsets every day
the sixth planet was ten times larger than the last
it was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote enormous books
oh  look
here comes an explorer
he cried out when he caught sight of the little prince
the little prince sat down on the table and panted a little
he had already travelled so far
where do you come from
the old gentleman said to him
what s that big book
said the little prince
what do you do here
i am a geographer   said the old gentleman
what s a geographer
he is a scholar who knows the location of the seas  the rivers  the towns  the mountains  and the deserts
that s very interesting   said the little prince
that really is  at last  a real profession
and he glanced around at the planet of the geographer
he had never seen such a majestic planet before
your planet is very beautiful   he said
are there oceans
i would nt know   said the geographer
oh
lrb the little prince was disappointed  rrb
and mountains
i would nt know   said the geographer
and towns  and rivers  and deserts
i would nt know that  either   said the geographer
but you re a geographer
that s true   the geographer said   but i am not an explorer
i do nt have a single explorer
it is not for the geographer to count the towns  the rivers  the mountains  the seas  the oceans  and the deserts
the geographer is too important to go strolling about
he does nt leave his desk
but he receives the explorers
he asks them questions  and he writes down their recollections
and if any of their recollections seem interesting to him  the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer s moral character
why s that
because an explorer who told lies would cause havoc to geography books
so would an explorer who drank too much
why s that
asked the little prince
because intoxicated men see double
so the geographer would record two mountains in a place where there was only one
i know someone   said the little prince   who d make a bad explorer
that s possible
so  when the moral character of the explorer appears to be in order  an inquiry is done into his discovery
you go to see it
no
that would be too complicated
but one requires the explorer to provide proof
if for example  the discovery in question was of a large mountain  one would require that he bring back large stones from it
the geographer suddenly became excited
but you  you come from far away
you are an explorer
you must describe your planet to me
and the geographer  having opened his big register  sharpened his pencil
the recitals of explorers are first recorded in pencil
one waits until the explorer has provided proof before recording them in ink
well
said the geographer
oh  where i live   said the little prince   it s not very interesting  everything is very small
i have three volcanoes
two active volcanoes  and one extinct one
but you never know
one never knows   said the geographer
i also have a flower
we do not record flowers   said the geographer
why s that
it s the prettiest thing
because flowers are ephemeral
what does that mean   ephemeral
geography books   said the geographer   of all books  are the most concerned with matters of consequence
they never become outdated
it is very rare that a mountain changes position
it is very rare that an ocean empties itself of its water
we write about eternal things
but extinct volcanoes can wake up   interrupted the little prince
what does  ephemeral  mean
whether volcanoes are extinct or active is of no consequence to us   said the geographer
the thing that matters to us is the mountain
it does not change
but what does  ephemeral  mean
repeated the little prince  who had never in his life let go of a question  once he had asked it
it means   which is at risk of imminent disappearance
is my flower at risk of imminent disappearance
of course
my flower is ephemeral   the little prince said to himself   and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world
and i ve left her all alone on my planet
that was his first moment of regret
but he took heart once again   what place would you advise me to visit
he asked
the planet earth   replied the geographer
it has a good reputation   and the little prince went away  thinking of his flower
so the seventh planet was the earth
the earth is nt just any old planet
it has 111 kings lrb not forgetting  of course  the negro kings amongst them rrb  7000 geographers  900000 businessmen  7500000 heavy drinkers  311000000 conceited men  that s to say  about 2000000000 grownups
to give you an idea of the size of the earth  i ll tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain  over the span of the six continents  a veritable army of 462511 streetlamp lighters
seen from a distance it made a wonderful spectacle
the movements of this army were regulated like those of an opera ballet
first came the turn of the lamplighters of new zealand and australia
having set their lamps alight  they would go off to bed
next came the turn of the lamplighters of china and siberia to enter into the dance
then they too would disappear into the wings
then came the turn of the lamplighters of russia and the indies
then those of africa and europe
then those of south america
then those of north america
and never would they make a mistake in their order of entry on stage
it was magnificent
only the lamp lighter of the single lamp of the north pole  and his colleague at the single lamp of the south pole led lives of leisure  they worked twice a year
when one wants to be witty  it can happen that one bends the truth a little
i have nt been entirely honest in telling you about the lamplighters
i run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do nt know it
men take up very little space on the earth
if the two billion people who inhabitant the earth were to stand upright and squash together a little  like for a meeting  they would easily fit on one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide
all humanity could be piled up on the smallest pacific islet
the grownups  of course  wo nt believe you
they picture themselves as taking up a lot of space
they think themselves as important as the baobabs
therefore you should advise them to do the math
they adore numbers  and that will please them
but do nt waste your time on this chore
there s no point
you trust me
the little prince  having arrived on earth  was very surprised not to see anyone
he had already started to worry that he d got the wrong planet  when a mooncoloured coil stirred in the sand
good evening   said the little prince courteously
good evening   said the snake
on what planet have i come down on
asked the little prince
onto earth  in africa   the snake answered
oh
so there s no one on earth
this is the desert
there is no one in the deserts
the earth is large   said the snake
the little prince sat down on a stone  and raised his eyes toward the sky
i wonder   he said   if the stars are lit so that each of us can one day find his own again
look at my planet
it s right there above us  but it s so far away
it is beautiful   said the snake
what has brought you here
i ve been having some trouble with a flower   said the little prince
ah
said the snake
and they were silent
where are the men
asked the little prince at last
it s a bit lonely in the desert    it is also lonely amongst men   the snake said
the little prince gazed at him for a long time
you re a funny animal   he said finally   as thin as a finger    but i am more powerful than the finger of a king   said the snake
the little prince smiled
you re not very powerful  you have nt even got any legs  you ca nt even travel    i can carry you further than a ship   said the snake
he wrapped himself around the little prince s ankle  like a golden bracelet
whoever i touch  i send him back to the earth from which he came   he continued
but you are pure  and you come from a star   the little prince made no reply
i feel sorry for you  so weak  on this earth made of granite
i can help you if someday you become too homesick for your planet
i can
oh
i understand very well   said the little prince   but why do you always speak in riddles
i solve them all   said the snake
and they were silent
the little prince crossed the desert and met only with one flower
a flower with three petals  a nondescript flower belonging to no one
good morning   said the little prince
good morning   said the flower
where are the men
asked the little prince politely
the flower had once seen a caravan passing
men
i think there exists six or seven of them
i saw them years ago
but you never know where to find them
they are blown here and there by the wind
they lack roots  it makes things very difficult for them   goodbye   said the little prince
goodbye   said the flower
chapter xix the little prince climbed a high mountain
the only mountains he d ever known were the three volcanoes that came up to his knees
and he used the extinct volcano as a footstool
from a mountain as high as this one   he said to himself   i ll be able to see the entire planet all at once  and all the people   but he saw nothing but sharp needles of rock
good morning   he said courteously
good morning  good morning  good morning    answered the echo
who are you
said the little prince
who are you  who are you  who are you
answered the echo
be my friends
i m all alone   he said
i m all alone  all alone  all alone    answered the echo
what a funny planet
he thought
it s all dry  and all jagged  and all barren
and the people have no imagination
they repeat whatever you say to them  on my planet i had a flower  she was always the first to speak
but it happened that the little prince  having walked for a long time through the sands  rocks  and snow  at last came across a road
and all roads lead to the dwellings of men
good morning   he said
it was a garden covered in roses
good morning   said the roses
the little prince gazed at them
they all looked just like his flower
who are you
he asked them  stunned
we re roses   the roses said
oh
said the little prince  and he suddenly felt very unhappy
his flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in the universe
and here were five thousand of them  all alike  in one single garden
she d be very upset   he said to himself   if she saw this  she d cough and cough and pretend to die to avoid being laughed at
and i d have to pretend to nurse her back to life  to humble myself also  because if i did nt  she really would allow herself to die   then he said to himself   i thought i was rich  with a flower that was one of a kind  and all i have is a common rose
that  and my three volcanoes that come up to my knees  of one which is perhaps forever extinct  that does nt make me a very great prince
and lying in the grass  he started to cry
it was then that the fox appeared   good morning   said the fox
good morning   responded the little prince politely  who then turned around  but saw nothing
i m right here   the voice said   under the apple tree    who are you
asked the little prince
you re very pretty
i m a fox   the fox said
come and play with me   proposed the little prince
i m so unhappy
i ca nt play with you   said the fox
i m not tamed
oh
i m sorry   said the little prince
but  after some thought  he added   what does that mean   tame
you are nt from here   said the fox
what is it that you re looking for
i m looking for men   said the little prince
what does  tame  mean
men   said the fox   they have guns  and they hunt
it s very bothersome
they also raise chickens
it s their sole interest
are you looking for chickens
no   said the little prince
i m looking for friends
what does  tame  mean
it s something that s too often forgotten   said the fox
it means  to establish bonds
to establish bonds
that s right   said the fox
to me  you re still only a little boy  just like a hundred thousand other little boys
and i do nt need you
and you do nt need me either
to you  i m only a fox  just like a hundred thousand other foxes
but if you tame me  we ll need each other
to me  you ll be unique in the entire world
to you  i ll be unique in the entire world    i m beginning to understand   said the little prince
there s a flower  i think she s tamed me    it s possible   said the fox
on earth you see all kinds of things
oh  but she s not on earth
said the little prince
the fox seemed very intrigued   on another planet
are there hunters on that planet
no
that s interesting
and chickens
no
nothing s perfect   sighed the fox
but the fox came back to his idea
my life is very monotonous
i hunt chickens  men hunt me
all the chickens look alike  and all the men look alike
so i get a bit bored
but if you tame me  it would bring some sunlight into my life
i d come to know a sound of footsteps unlike any other
other footsteps send me hurrying back underground
yours would call me out of my burrow like music
and then look  you see the wheat fields down there
i do nt eat bread
wheat is of no use to me
the wheat fields mean nothing to me
and that s sad
but your hair is the colour of gold
so it ll be wonderful when you ve tamed me
the wheat  which is golden  will remind me of you
and i ll love the sound of the wind blowing through the wheat   the fox went silent and gazed at the little prince for a long time
please  tame me
he said
i really want to   the little prince replied   but i do nt have much time
i have friends to discover  and many things to understand
one only understands the things that one tames   said the fox
men no longer have the time to get to know anything
they buy things ready made in the shops
but as there are nt any shops that sell friends  men no longer have any friends
if you want a friend  tame me
what should i do
asked the little prince
you have to be very patient   replied the fox
first you ll sit down a little way away from me  like this  in the grass
i ll watch you out of the corner of my eye and you wo nt say anything
words are a source of misunderstandings
but every day you ll be able to sit a little closer   the next day the little prince came back
it would ve been better to come back at the same time of day   said the fox
if you come  for example  at four oclock in the afternoon  from three oclock i d start to feel happy
as the time got nearer  i d feel happier and happier
already by four oclock  i d be jumping about and getting restless  i d come to learn the price of happiness
but if you come at just any time  i  d never know at what time my heart should be ready to greet you  we must observe the rites
what s a rite
asked the little prince
they are also something too often forgotten   said the fox
they are what make one day different from other days  one hour different from other hours
there s a rite  for example  among my hunters
on thursdays they dance with the girls of the village
so thursday is a wonderful day
i can go for a walk as far as the vineyards
if the hunters danced on just any day  all the days would be alike  and i d never have any rest
so the little prince tamed the fox
and when the time to leave drew near   oh   said the fox   i ll cry
it s your fault   said the little prince
i never wished you any harm  but you wanted me to tame you    i know   said the fox
but you re going to cry
said the little prince
i know   said the fox
so all this has done you no good at all
it has done me good   said the fox   because of the colour of the wheat
and then he added   go and see the roses again
you ll understand that yours is unique in the entire world
then come back to say goodbye to me  and i ll make you a present of a secret
the little prince went away to see the roses again   you are nt like my rose at all  you are nothing yet   he told them
no one has tamed you  and you have nt tamed anyone
you re like my fox used to be
he was only a fox  just like a hundred thousand others
but i ve made him my friend  and now he s unique in the entire world
and the roses were very embarrassed
you are beautiful  but you are empty   he went on
one could not die for you
of course  an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you
but she alone is more important than all of you  because it s her that i watered  because it s her that i put under the glass dome  because it s her that i sheltered behind the screen  because it s for her that i killed the caterpillars lrb except two or three  to become butterflies rrb  because it s her that i listened to grumble  or boast  or even sometimes when she said nothing
because she s my rose
and he went back to the fox   goodbye   he said
goodbye   said the fox
here s my secret
it s very simple  one only sees clearly with the heart
what is essential is invisible to the eye
what is essential is invisible to the eye   repeated the little prince  so as to remember
it is the time you have wasted on your rose that makes your rose so important
it is the time i have wasted on my rose   said the little prince  so as to remember
the men have forgotten this truth   said the fox
but you must not forget it
you become forever responsible for that which you have tamed
you are responsible for your rose    i am responsible for my rose   repeated the little prince  so as to remember
good morning   said the little prince
good morning   said the railway switchman
what do you do here
the little prince asked
i sort travellers  in packs of a thousand   said the switchman
i dispatch the trains that carry them  sometimes to the right  sometimes to the left
and a brilliantly lit express train  rumbling like thunder  shook the switchman s cabin
they really are in a hurry   said the little prince
what is it that they re looking for
not even the locomotive engineer knows that   said the switchman
a second brilliantly lit express thundered by in the opposite direction
are they back already
asked the little prince
these are nt the same ones   said the switchman
it s an exchange
were nt they happy where they were
no one is ever happy where they are   said the switchman
a third brilliantly lit express thundered by
are they chasing after the first travellers
asked the little prince
they are nt chasing after anything at all   said the switchman
they re asleep in there  or if not  they re yawning
only the children are squashing their noses up against the windows
only the children know what they re after   said the little prince
they waste their time with a rag doll and it becomes very important to them  and if someone takes it away from them  they cry    they re lucky   said the switchman
good morning   said the little prince
good morning   said the merchant
this was a merchant who sold pills that had been created to quench thirst
you take one pill a week  and you no longer feel the need to drink anything
why are you selling those
asked the little prince
it s a big time saver   said the merchant
experts have done calculations
you save fiftythree minutes per week
and what do i do with the fiftythree minutes
you can do anything you like with them    myself   the little prince said to himself   if i had fiftythree minutes to spend as i liked  i d walk very slowly toward a spring of fresh water
we were at the eighth day since my accident in the desert  and i d listened to the story of the merchant as i drank the last drop of my water supply
ah   i said to the little prince   these memories of yours are very charming  but i have nt managed to repair my plane yet  i have nothing left to drink  and i  too  would be happy if i could walk slowly towards a spring of fresh water
my friend the fox   he said to me
my dear fellow  our situation has nothing to do with the fox anymore
why not
because we will die of thirst
he did nt follow my reasoning  and he answered me   it s nice to have had a friend  even if you re about to die
myself  i m glad to have had a fox as a friend    he never considers the danger   i said to myself
he s never been hungry or thirsty
a little sunshine is all he needs   but he looked at me and replied to my thought   i m also thirsty
let s look for a well
i made a gesture of weariness  it s absurd to look for a well  at random  in the immensity of the desert
but we started walking anyway
when we had walked for hours in silence  night fell  and the stars began to come out
i saw them as if in a dream  as my thirst had made me feverish
the little prince s words danced in my memory   so you re also thirsty
i asked him
but he did nt reply to my question
he said simply   water can be good for the heart too   i did nt understand his answer  but i said nothing
i knew better than to press my questions
he was tired
he sat down
i sat down beside him
and  after a silence  he spoke again   the stars are beautiful because of a flower that ca nt be seen
i replied   that s true
and i looked  without saying anything  at the folds of sand in the moonlight
the desert is beautiful   the little prince added
and it was true
i have always loved the desert
you sit down on a sand dune
you see nothing
you hear nothing
and yet something radiates forth in the silence   what makes the desert beautiful   said the little prince   is that somewhere it hides a well   i was surprised to suddenly understand this mysterious radiation of the sands
when i was a little boy i lived in an old house  and legend told that a treasure was buried there
of course  no one had ever been able to find it  or perhaps no one had even looked for it
but it cast an enchantment over that house
my home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart   yes   i said to the little prince
whether the house  the stars  or the desert  what gives them their beauty is something invisible
i m glad   he said   that you agree with my fox
as the little prince fell asleep  i took him in my arms and set out walking again
i felt deeply moved
it seemed to me that i was carrying a very fragile treasure
it even seemed to me that there was nothing more fragile on earth
i looked in the moonlight at his pale forehead  his closed eyes  his locks of hair that trembled in the wind  and i said to myself   what i see here is only a shell
that which is most important is invisible   as his slightly parted lips gave way to a halfsmile  i continued   what i find so deeply moving about this little sleeping prince is his devotion to a flower  it s the image of a rose that shines in him like the flame of a lamp  even when he s sleeping
and i came to think of him as even more fragile
one has to look after lamps  a gust of wind can put them out  and  continuing to walk  i found the well at daybreak
men   said the little prince   stuff themselves into express trains  but they do nt know what they re looking for
so they rush about  and go round in circles   and he added   it s not worth it   the well that we had reached was nt like the other wells of the sahara
the wells of the sahara are mere holes dug in the sand
this one looked like a village well
but there was no village there  and i thought i was dreaming
it s strange   i said to the little prince   everything s been prepared  the pulley  the bucket  and the rope   he laughed  took the rope  and put the pulley to work
and the pulley moaned like an old weathervane when there has long been no wind
can you hear that
said the little prince   we ve woken up the well  and it s singing   i did nt want him to tire himself out
let me do it   i said   it s too heavy for you
i hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it down good and level
the song of the pulley continued in my ears  and in the still trembling water i could see the sunlight shimmer
i m thirsty for this water   said the little prince
give me some to drink   and i knew then what he d been looking for
i raised the bucket to his lips
he drank  his eyes closed
it was as sweet as some special festival treat
this water was something very different from ordinary nourishment
it was born of the walk under the stars  of the song of the pulley  of the effort of my arms
it was good for the heart  like a present
when i was a little boy  the lights of the christmas tree  the music of the midnight mass  the tenderness in the smiles produced  in a similar way  the radiance of the gift that i received
the men where you live   said the little prince   grow five thousand roses in a single garden  and they do nt find what they re looking for in it
they do nt find it   i replied
and yet what they re looking for could be found in a single rose  or in a little water    that s true   i said
and the little prince added   but the eyes are blind
you have to search with the heart   i had drunk the water
i breathed easily
the sand at sunrise is the color of honey
this honey color was also making me feel good
why then did i have to have this sense of grief   you have to keep your promise   said the little prince softly  who had again sat down beside me
what promise
you know  a muzzle for my sheep  i m responsible for this flower   i took my sketches out of my pocket
the little prince saw them  and laughed as he said   your baobabsthey look a bit like cabbages
oh
and i d been so proud of my baobabs
your fox  his ears  they look a bit like horns  and they re too long
and he laughed again
you are nt being fair  my little fellow
i do nt know how to draw anything except boa constrictors  closed and open
oh  it ll be all ok   he said   children understand
so i made a pencil sketch of a muzzle
and i felt a pang in my heart as i gave it to him
you have plans that i do nt know about   but he did nt respond
he said to me   you know  my descent to earth  tomorrow will be its anniversary
then after a silence he went on   i came down very near here
and he blushed
and once again  without understanding why  i felt a peculiar sense of sorrow
one question occurred to me however   so it was nt by chance that the morning i first met you  a week ago  you were out walking like that  all alone  a thousand miles from any inhabited region
you were going back to the place where you landed
the little prince blushed again
and i added  hesitantly   perhaps because of the anniversary
the little prince blushed once more
he never answered questions  but when you blush  that means  yes   does nt it
oh   i said to him   i m worried   but he responded   now you must work
you must go back to your engine
i ll wait for you here
come back tomorrow evening
but i was nt reassured
i remembered the fox
you run the risk of weeping a little  if you allow yourself to be tamed
there was  next to the well  the ruin of an old stone wall
when i came back from my work  the next evening  i saw from a distance my little price sitting on top of it  his feet hanging down
and i heard him say   do nt you remember then
he said
this is nt the exact spot
another voice must have answered him  because he replied   yes  yes
it s the right day  but this is nt the right place
i continued my walk toward the wall
i still did nt see or hear anyone
yet the little prince replied again    that s right
you ll see where my tracks begin in the sand
you just have to wait there for me
i ll be there tonight   i was twenty meters from the wall  and i still saw nothing
the little prince spoke again  after a pause   do you have good poison
are you sure you wo nt make me suffer too long
i froze  my heart skipped a beat  but i still did nt understand
now go away   he said   i want to come down from here
i then lowered my eyes to the foot of the wall  and i leapt up
right there  facing the little prince was one of those yellow snakes that can kill you in thirty seconds flat
even as i dug around in my pocket to take out my revolver  i made a running step back
but  at the noise i made  the snake let himself flow easily across the sand  like the dying spray of a fountain  and in no apparent hurry  slipped between the stones with a light metallic sound
i reached the wall just in time to catch my little fellow in my arms  who was white as snow
what s going on here
why are you talking with snakes
i d loosened the golden muffler that he always wore
i d moistened his temples and had him drink
and now i did nt dare ask him anything more
he looked at me gravely and put his arms around my neck
i felt his heart beat like the heart of a dying bird  when shot with a rifle
he said to me   i m glad that you ve found what was wrong with your engine
now you ll be able to go back home    how did you know
i was just coming to tell him that  against all odds  my work had been successful
he made no answer to my question  but he added   i m also going back home today   then he said sadly   it s a lot further  it s much more difficult   i felt very clearly that something extraordinary was happening
i held him tightly in my arms like a small child  and yet it seemed to me that he was plummeting down into an abyss  and that i could do nothing to restrain him  he had a serious look  as if lost far away
i have your sheep
and i have the box for the sheep
and i have the muzzle   and he smiled sadly
i waited a long while
i could feel that he was reviving little by little
my little fellow   i said to him   you re afraid   he was afraid  of course
but he laughed softly   i ll be much more afraid this evening   again i felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable
and i knew that i could nt bear the idea of never hearing that laughter again
for me  it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert
little fellow   i said   i want to hear you laugh again
but he said to me   tonight  it ll be a year
my star will be right above the spot where i came down to earth  a year ago    little fellow  is this all a bad dreamthis business with the snake  and the meetingplace  and the star
but he did nt answer my question
he said to me   that which is important ca nt be seen    i know    it s like with the flower
if you love a flower that s on a star  it s sweet to look at the sky at night
all the stars are covered with flowers    i know    it s like with the water
the water you gave me to drink was like music  because of the pulley  and the rope  you remember  it was good
i know
at night you ll look at the stars
where i live everything is too small for me to point out to you where my star is
it s better like that
my star will be for you just one of the stars
so you ll love to look at all of the stars  they ll all be your friends
and  besides  i m going to make you a present   he laughed again
ah  little fellow  dear little fellow
i love to hear that laugh
that s my present
just that
it ll be like with the water    what are you trying to say
everyone has the same stars  but they are not the same to everyone
for some  who are travelers  the stars are guides
for others they are nothing but little lights
for others  who are scholars  they are problems
for my businessman they were wealth
but none of these stars say anything back
you will have the stars as no one else has them    what are you trying to say
when you look at the sky at night  because i ll be living on one of them  because i ll be laughing on one of them  for you it ll be like all the stars are laughing
youonly youwill have stars that can laugh
and he laughed again
and when your sorrow is comforted lrb time heals all wounds rrb you ll be glad to have known me
you ll always be my friend
you ll want to laugh with me
and sometimes  you ll open your window  just like that  for fun  and your friends will be very surprised to see you laughing whilst watching the sky
so you ll tell them   yes  the stars always make me laugh
and they ll think you re crazy
i will have played a dirty trick on you  and he laughed again
it  ll be as if i d given you  instead of stars  lots and lots of little bells that can laugh   and he laughed some more
then he suddenly became serious again   tonight  you know  do nt come
i wo nt leave you
it ll look as if i m suffering  it ll look a bit as if i m dying
it s like that
do nt come to see that
it s not worth it    i wo nt leave you
but he was worried
i m telling you this  it s also because of the snake
he must nt bite you  snakes are mean
they can bite you just for fun    i wo nt leave you
but something reassured him   it s true that they have no poison left for a second bite
that night i did nt see him set out
he got away without making a sound
when i managed to catch him up  he was walking along determinedly  at a brisk pace
he said to me only   oh
you came   and he took me by the hand
but he was still worrying
you ve made a mistake
you ll suffer
it ll look as if i m dead  and that wo nt be true   i said nothing
you understand
it s too far
i ca nt carry this body with me
it s too heavy
i said nothing
but it ll be like an old abandoned shell
there s nothing sad about old shells   i said nothing
he got a bit discouraged
but he made one more effort   you know  it ll be nice
i ll also look at the stars
all the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley
all the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink   i said nothing
it ll be so much fun
you ll have five hundred million little bells  and i ll have five hundred million springs of fresh water   and then he too was silent  because he was crying
here s the place
let me go on by myself
and he sat down because he was afraid
he said   you knowmy flower  i m responsible for her
and she s so weak
and she s so naïve
she has four thorns  of no use at all  to protect herself against the entire world   i sat down too because i was no longer able to stand
he said   there  that s everything   he hesitated a bit  and then stood back up
he took one step
i could nt move
there was nothing but a yellow flash close to his ankle
he remained motionless for an instant
he did nt cry out
he fell as gently as a tree falls
there was not even any sound  because of the sand
and now of course  it s already been six years  i had never yet told this story
the companions who met me were very happy to see me alive again
i was sad  but i told them   it s because i m tired   now my sorrow is comforted a little
i mean  not entirely
but i do know that he got back to his planet  because at daybreak i did nt find his body
it was nt a very heavy body  and i love to listen to the stars at night
it s just like five hundred million little bells  but there is one extraordinary thing
when i drew the muzzle for the little prince  i forgot to add the leather strap to it
he would never have been able to fasten it to the sheep
so i wonder  what happened on his planet
it may well be the sheep ate the flower  sometimes i tell myself   surely not
the little prince shuts his flower under her glass dome every night  and he watches over his sheep very carefully   then i m happy
and all the stars laugh sweetly
other times i tell myself   everyone is absentminded at some point  and that s all it takes
one evening he would ve forgotten the glass dome  or maybe the sheep got out quietly during the night   and then the little bells turn to tears  herein lies a great mystery
for you  who also love the little prince  just like for me  nothing in the universe is the same if somewhere out there  a sheep that we have never seen has  has it
eaten a rose  look at the sky
ask yourselves  has the sheepyes or noeaten the flower
and you will see how everything changes  and no grownup will ever understand that this is a matter of such importance
this  to me  is the most beautiful and most sad landscape in the world
it s the same landscape as the one on the previous page  but i have drawn it again to show it to you properly
it s here that the little prince appeared on earth  and then disappeared
look at this landscape carefully  so as to be sure to recognise it if one day you travel in africa  in the desert
and if you happen to pass by there  i beg you  do nt hurry on  wait a while exactly under the star
if a child then comes to you  if he laughs  if he has golden hair  if he does nt respond when questioned  you ll easily guess who it is
so think of me
save me from this sorrow  write to me quickly  to tell me he s back
