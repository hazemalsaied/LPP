once when i be six year old i saw a magnificent picture in a book about the primeval forest call reallife story
it show a boa constrictor swallow a wild animal
here be a copy of the drawing
it say in the book boa constrictor swallow their prey whole without chew
then they be not able to move and they sleep for the six month it take for digestion
so i think a lot about the adventure of the jungle and in turn i manage with a coloured pencil to make my first drawing
my draw no 1
it look like this i show my masterpiece to the grownup and i ask them if my drawing frighten them
they answer me why would anyone be frighten by a hat
my drawing be not of a hat
it show a boa constrictor digest an elephant
i then draw the inside of the boa constrictor so that the grownup could understand
they always need to have thing explain
my draw no 2 look like this the grownup advise me to leave aside drawing of boa constrictor open or close and to apply myself instead to geography history arithmetic and grammar
thus i abandon at the age of six a magnificent career a a painter
i be discourage by the failure of my draw no 1 and of my draw no 2
grownup never understand anything by themselves and it s tiresome for child to always explain thing for them again and again
so i have to choose another profession and i learn to fly airplane
i fly a little in many place around the world
and geography it s true have serve me well
i could recognize at first glance china from arizona
it s very useful if you get lose at night
i have have during my life a lot of contact with many person of consequence
i have live a lot amongst the grownup
i have see them from close up
it have nt much improve my opinion of them
whenever i meet one of them that seem a bit more clearsighted i try the experiment of show them my draw no 1 that i ve always keep
i want to know if they be really a person of true understanding
but they always respond it s a hat
so i would never speak to them of boa constrictor nor of primeval forest nor of the star
i put myself at their level
i talk to them about bridge golf politics and necktie
and the grownup be glad to know such a sensible man
so i live alone without anyone i could really talk to until a breakdown in the sahara desert six year ago
something have break in my engine
and a i have with me neither a mechanic nor any passenger i readied myself to try and carry out all alone the difficult repair
for me it be a matter of life or death
i have hardly enough water to drink for a week
the first night i go to sleep on the sand a thousand mile from any human habitation
i be more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean
so you can imagine my surprise when at daybreak a funny little voice wake me up
it say please draw me a sheep
what
draw me a sheep
i jump to my foot a if i d be strike by lightning
i rub my eye
i take a good look around me
and i saw a quite extraordinary little man who be examine me seriously
here be the best portrait that late i manage to do of him
but my drawing of course be much less charm than it model
it s not my fault
i be discourage in my career a a painter by the grownup at the age of six and i have nt learn to draw anything except boa constrictor close and open
i star at this sudden apparition wide eye with astonishment
remember that i be a thousand mile from any inhabited region
and yet this little fellow seem neither lose nor halfdead with fatigue nor starve or die of thirst or fear
he look nothing like a child lose in the middle of the desert a thousand mile from any inhabited region
when i finally manage to speak i say but what be you do here
and he repeat very slowly a if it be something very serious please draw me a sheep when a mystery be too overpower one dare not disobey
absurd a it seem to me a thousand mile from any human habitation and in danger of death i take out of my pocket a sheet of paper and a pen
but then i remember that i have mainly study geigraphy history arithmetic and grammar and i tell the little fellow lrb a little crossly rrb that i do nt know how to draw
he reply it do nt matter
draw me a sheep
a i d never draw a sheep i redrew for him one of the only two drawing that i be capable of
the one of the closed boa constrictor
and i be astound to hear the little fellow respond no
no
i do nt want an elephant inside a boa constrictor
a boa constrictor be very dangerous and an elephant be very cumbersome
where i live everything be very small
i need a sheep
draw me a sheep
so i draw
he look carefully then say no
this one s already very sick
make another one
i draw again my friend smile gently and indulgently you can see yourself this be nt a sheep it s a ram
it have horn so once again i redo my drawing but it be reject like the previous one this one s too old
i want a sheep that will live a long time
so get impatient a i be eager to start dismantle my engine i hastily sketch this drawing and i snap this here be the box
the sheep you want be inside
but i be very surprised to see the face of my young judge light up it s exactly the way i want
do you think this sheep need a lot of grass
why
because where i m from everything be very small there will certainly be enough
i give you a very small sheep
he lean his head towards the draw not that small look
he s fall asleep and that s how i meet the little prince
chapter iii it take me a long time to find out where he come from
the little prince who ask me many question never seem to hear my own
it be the word speak by chance that little by little reveal everything to me
so when he saw my airplane for the first time lrb i wo nt draw my airplane it would be a drawing far too complicate for me rrb he ask me what s that thing there
it s not a thing
it fly
it s an airplane
it s my airplane
and i be proud to have him know that i could fly
then he cry what
you fell from the sky
yes i say modestly
oh
that s funny
and the little prince break into a lovely peal of laughter which irritate me very much
i prefer people to take my misfortune seriously
then he add so you also come from the sky
what planet be you from
i catch a glimpse into the mystery of his presence and i ask abruptly so you come from another planet then
but he do nt answer
he shake his head slowly whilst look at my airplane it s true that you ca nt have come from far away in that thing and he drift into a daydream which last a long while
then take my sheep out of his pocket he sink himself into the contemplation of his treasure
you can imagine how my curiosity be arouse by this small disclosure about the other planet
so i try to find out more where be you from my little fellow
where s this where i live of yours
where do you take my sheep off to
after a reflective silence he answer what s good about the box you ve give me be that at night he can use it a a house
that s right
and if you re good i ll give you a rope to tie him up with during the day
and a stake
the offer seem to shock the little prince tie him up
what a funny idea
but if you do nt tie him up he ll wander off and get lose
my friend break into another peal of laughter where do you think he d go
anywhere
straight ahead then the little prince say gravely that do nt matter where i live everything be so small
and perhaps with a hint of sadness he add straight ahead you ca nt go far
i thus learn a second very important thing that his home planet be barely big than a house
it do nt surprise me much
i know that apart from the large planet like the earth jupiter mar and venus which have be give name there be hundred of others that be sometimes so small that one have great difficulty in spot them through the telescope
when an astronomer discover one of these he give it a number for a name
he might call it for example asteroid 325
i have serious reason to believe that the planet from where the little prince come be the asteroid b612
this asteroid have only be see through a telescope once in 1909 by a turkish astronomer
he have then give a big presentation on his discovery at an international astronomy conference
but nobody have believe him because of his outfit
grownup be like that
fortunately for the reputation of asteroid b612 a turkish dictator impose on his people on pain of death to dress themselves in the european fashion
the astronomer give his presentation again in 1920 dressed very stylishly
and this time everybody believe him
if i have tell you these detail about the asteroid b612 and reveal to you it number it s because of the grownup
grownup love number
when you talk to them about a new friend they never ask you about any of the important thing
they never ask you how do his voice sound
what game do he like best
do he collect butterfly
they ask how old be he
how many brother do he have
how much do he weigh
how much money do his father make
only then do they think they know him
if you say to the grownup i saw a beautiful red brick house with geranium by the window and dove on the roof they would nt be able to picture this house in their mind
you d have to tell them i saw a hundred thousand franc house
and they d cry how pretty
so if you be to say to them the proof that the little prince exist be that he be charm he laugh and he want a sheep
if someone want a sheep that prove they exist they d shrug their shoulder and treat you like a child
but if you be to say the planet he come from be the asteroid b612 they d be convince and leave you in peace and spare you their question
they re like that
do nt blame them
child should be forgive towards the grownup
but of course those of u who understand life we do nt much care for number
i d have like to begin this story in the same way a a fairy tale
i d have like to say once upon a time there be a little prince who live on a planet not much big than himself and who need a friend for those who understand life it would have seem much more natural
for i do nt want my book to be read lightly
i feel so much sadness in recount these memory
it s already be six year since my friend leave with his sheep
if i try to describe him here it s so a not to forget him
it s sad to forget a friend
not everyone have have a friend
and if i forget him i could become like the grownup who be only interested in number
so that s why i have again buy a box of paint and some pencil
it s hard to take up draw again at my age when i have only ever attempt to draw a boa constrictor close and open at the age of six
i ll try of course to make my portrait as lifelike a possible
but i m not quite sure i ll succeed
some drawing go alright others do nt look like their subject
i also get the size a bit wrong
here the little prince be too big
there he s too small
i m also not sure about the colour of his outfit
so i fumble along somehow a best i can
i will make mistake on certain important point too
but you ll have to forgive me that
my friend never give explanation
perhaps he think i be just like himself
but i unfortunately do nt know how to see sheep through box
perhaps i m a bit like the grownup
i must have get old
every day i d learn something about his planet the departure and the trip
the information come slowly a his thought wander
it be in this way that on the third day i come to know of the tragedy of the baobab
this time again it be thanks to the sheep because the little prince ask me abruptly a if seize by a grave doubt it s true be nt it that sheep eat shrub
yes
it s true
oh
i be glad
i do nt understand why it be so important that sheep eat shrub
but the little prince add then it follow they also eat baobab
i point out to the little prince that baobab be not shrubs but tree as big a church and that even if he take with him a whole herd of elephant the herd would nt manage to eat up one single baobab
the idea of the herd of elephant make the little prince laugh they d have to be pile up on top of each other but he remark wisely the baobab tree before they grow up start off small
that s right
but why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobab
he reply oh come on
a if it be obvious
and it take me a great mental effort to understand this problem on my own without any help
and indeed on the planet of the little prince there be like on all planet both good plant and bad plant
and therefore both good seed from good plant and bad seed from bad plant
but seed be invisible
they sleep secretly deep in the earth until on a whim one of them decide to wake up
then it elongate and grow timidly at first toward the sun a charming little harmless sprig
if it s a sprig of radish or rise bush you can let it grow a it like
but if it s a bad plant one must pull the plant out straight away as soon a it can be recognise
now there be some terrible seed on the planet of the little prince there be the seed of baobab tree
the soil of the planet be infest with them
a baobab if you get to it too late can never be get rid of
it take over the entire planet
it pierce it with it root
and if the planet be too small and if there be too many baobab they shatter it to piece
it s a matter of discipline the little prince tell me later
after groom oneself in the morning the planet must be carefully groom
you must see to it that you regularly pull out the baobab as soon a they can be tell apart from the rise bush to which they look very similar when they re very young
it s a very boring job but very easy
and one day he suggest that i apply myself to make a beautiful drawing so that the child from where i come from would understand all this
if one day they travel he say to me it could come in useful
sometimes there s no harm in postpone one s work
but in the case of baobab that always lead to a catastrophe
i use to know a planet inhabit by a lazy man
he have neglect three little bush and base on what the little prince tell me i draw this planet
i do nt like to sound like a moralist
but the danger of the baobab be so little understood and the risk run by anyone who might get lose on an asteroid be so large that for once i be break my normal reserve
i say child
beware of baobab
it s to warn my friend of the danger they ve long be skirt like myself without know it that i have work so hard on this drawing
the lesson which i pass on by this mean be worth the effort
you might be wonder why be it that in this book there be nt any other drawing as impressive a the drawing of the baobab
the answer be simple i try but i could nt succeed
when i draw the baobab i be spur on by a sense of urgency
oh
little prince i come to understand gradually in this way your sad life
for a long time your only entertainment be the softness of the sunset
i learn this new detail on the fourth day in the morning when you say to me i m very fond of sunset
let s go and see a sunset now but we have to wait wait for what
wait until the sun go down
you seem surprised at first and then you chuckle at yourself
and you say i think myself at home still
indeed
when it s noon in the united state the sun everybody know be set over france
it would suffice to be able to go to france in one minute to be able see a sunset
unfortunately france be much too far away
but on your tiny planet all you need be to move your chair a few step
and you watch the twilight fall whenever you like one day i saw the sunset fortyfour time
and a little later you add you know you love the sunset when you re really sad the day you saw it fortyfour time be you be really that sad then
but the little prince make no reply
on the fifth day again thanks to the sheep this secret of the little prince s life be reveal to me
he ask abruptly without anything lead up to it a if it be the result of a long silent meditation on a problem if a sheep eats shrubs then do it eat flower too a sheep eats everything it find
even flower that have thorn
yes even flower that have thorn
what be the thorn for then
i do nt know the answer
i be very busy try to unscrew a bolt in my engine that have get stuck
i be very worried because my breakdown be begin to appear to be very serious and i have so little drinking water leave that i have to fear the bad
what be the thorn for then
the little prince never let go of a question once he have ask it
i be upset over the bolt and i say the first thing that come into my head the thorn be of no use at all
flower have thorn just for spite
oh
but after a moment of silence he exclaim with a sort of resentment i do nt believe you
flower be weak creature
they re naive
they reassure themselves a best they can
they think themselves frightful with their thorn i make no reply
at that moment i be think to myself if this bolt wo nt budge i ll knock it out with a hammer
the little prince interrupt my thought again and you actually believe that flower no
no
i do nt believe it at all
i answer the first thing that come to my mind
i myself be busy with matter of consequence
he look at me dumbfound
matter of consequence
he watch me hammer in hand and my finger black with grease lean on an object that would have seem to him very ugly
you talk just like the grownup
that make me feel a little ashamed
but he go on relentlessly you confuse everything you mix everything up
he be really very angry
he shake his golden curl in the breeze i know a planet where there be a redfaced gentleman
he have never smell a flower
he have never look at a star
he have never love anyone
he have never do anything but sum
and all day long he repeat just like you i be busy with matter of consequence
and that make him swell up with pride
but this be not a man he s a mushroom
a what
a mushroom
the little prince be now white with rage
flower have be grow thorn for million of year
for million of year the sheep have eat the flower all the same
and it s not a matter of consequence to try to understand why they take so much trouble to grow thorn which be never of any use
be the war between flower and sheep not important
be it not of more consequence and more important than the sum of a fat redfaced gentleman
and if i myself know of a unique flower which grow nowhere but on my planet that a little sheep can destroy in one stroke just like that one morning without realise what he s do be that not important
he blush and continue if someone love a flower of which just one specimen exist amongst the million and million of star it s enough to make him happy when he look at them
he can say my flower be out there somewhere but if the sheep eat the flower for him it s a if suddenly all the star have go out
and you think that s not important
he could nt say anything more
he suddenly burst into tear
night have fall
i have put down my tool
of what moment be my hammer my bolt or thirst or death
there be on a star on a planet my planet earth a little prince to be comfort
i take him in my arm
i rock him
i say the flower that you love be nt in danger i ll draw you a muzzle for your sheep i ll draw you a rail for your flower i
i be nt sure what to say
i felt very awkward
i do nt know how to reach him where to find him it s so secretive the land of tear
i learn very quickly to know this flower well
there have always be very simple flower on the planet of the little prince decorate with a single row of petal that do nt take up any space and do nt bother anyone
they would appear one morning in the grass and by even they d have fade away
but this one have sprout one day from a seed blow in from no one know where and the little prince have watch very closely this sprout that be not like the other sprout
it could have be a new kind of baobab
but the shrub soon stop grow and begin to produce a flower
the little prince who witness the appearance of a huge bud felt that a miraculous apparition must emerge from it but the flower never stop prepare for her future beauty safe in her green chamber
she choose her colour carefully
she dress slowly she arrange her petal one by one
she do not want to come out all rumple like the poppy
she would only want to appear in the full radiance of her beauty
oh yes
she be a very flirtatious creature
and her mysterious adornment have thus last for day and day
then one morning exactly at sunrise she suddenly show herself
and after have work with such care and attention to detail she say with a yawn oh
i have only just wake up i do apologize i be not yet presentable the little prince could nt restrain his admiration you re so beautiful
be i not
the flower respond sweetly
and i be bear at the same moment a the sun the little prince guess easily enough that she be not very modest but how moving she be
it s time i think for breakfast she add an instant later if you would have the kindness to think of my need
and the little prince completely abash have go to look for a sprinkling can of fresh water tend to the flower
and like that she have soon begin to torment him with her vanity
one day for example speaking of her four thorn she tell the little prince let them come the tiger with their claw
there be nt any tiger on my planet the little prince object and tiger do nt eat weed
i be not a weed the flower reply sweetly
please forgive me i do not fear tiger but i detest draft
you would nt happen to have a screen
detests draft that s bad luck for a plant remark the little prince
what a very complicate flower
in the evening you will put me under a glass dome
it be very cold where you live
where i come from but she interrupt herself
she have come in the form of a seed
she could nt have know anything of other world
humiliate at have be catch out on a lie so naive she cough two or three time to imply the little prince be in the wrong
the screen
i be just go to look for it when you speak to me
then she force a cough to inflict still more remorse
so the little prince despite the good will of his love have soon come to doubt her
he have take seriously word of no importance and have become very unhappy
i should nt have listen to her he tell me one day you should never listen to the flower
we must look at them and breathe their fragrance
mine perfume my whole planet but i do nt know how to take pleasure in it
this business of the claw which annoy me so much should only have fill my heart with tenderness and pity he continue his confidence i do nt know how to understand
i should have her judge by her deed and not by her word
she overwhelm me with her fragrance and light
i should never have run away
i should have see the tenderness behind her contrivance
flower be so contradictory
but i be too young to know how to love her
i think that for his escape he take advantage of a migration of a flock of wild bird
on the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order
he carefully sweep out his active volcano
he own two active volcano it be very convenient for heat his breakfast in the morning
he also own an extinct volcano
but a he use to say you never know
so he clean out the extinct volcano too
if they be well clean out volcano burn slowly and steadily without any eruption
volcanic eruption be like fire in a chimney
on our earth we re obviously much too small to clean out our volcano
that s why they cause u no end of trouble
the little prince also pull up with a hint of sadness the last little shoot of the baobab
he believe he would never return
but all these familiar task seem on that morning very precious
and a he water the flower one last time and prepare to shelter her under her dome he find himself close to tear
goodbye he say to the flower
but she do nt answer
goodbye he say again
the flower cough
but it be not because she have a cold
i be silly she say finally
i ask your forgiveness
try to be happy
he be surprise by this absence of reproach
he stand there all bewilder the dome held in midair
he do nt understand this quiet sweetness
of course i love you the flower say to him
it s my fault that you do nt know
that be of no importance
but you have be just as foolish a i have
try to be happy let the dome be
i do not want it anymore
but the wind my cold be not all that bad the cool night air will do me good
i be a flower
but the animal i will have to endure two or three caterpillar if i wish to become acquainted with the butterfly
it seem that they be very beautiful
and otherwise who else will come to visit me
you will be far away
a for the large animal i be not at all afraid of anything
i have my claw
and naively she show her four thorn
then she add do nt linger like this it s tiresome
you have decide to leave
now go
for she do not want him to see her cry
she be such a proud flower
he find himself in the neighborhood of the asteroid 325 326 327 328 329 and 330
so he begin by visit them to learn more
the first one be inhabit by a king
the king be sit dress in purple and ermine on a very simple yet majestic throne
ah
here come a subject exclaim the king when he catch sight of the little prince
and the little prince ask himself how could he recognise me when he s never see me before
he do nt know that for king the world be very much simplify
to them all men be subject
approach so that i may see you good say the king who be very proud to finally be king over somebody
the little prince look around him for a place to sit but the planet be completely take over by the magnificent ermine robe
so he remain stand and since he be tire he yawn
it be contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king the monarch say to him
i forbid you to do so
i ca nt stop myself reply the little prince thoroughly embarrass
ive come on a long journey and i have nt slept ah then the king say
i order you to yawn
i have not see anyone yawn for year
yawn to me be object of curiosity
come now
yawn again
it be an order
that frighten me i ca nt any more say the little prince blushing
hum
hum
reply the king
then i i order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to he sputter a bit and seem vexed
for the king fundamentally insist that his authority be respect
he do nt tolerate disobedience
he be an absolute monarch
but because he be good at heart he give reasonable order
if i order a general he would often say if i order a general to change himself into a seabird and if the general do not obey me it would not be the general s fault
it would be my fault
may i sit down
the little prince enquire timidly
i order you to sit down reply the king who majestically gather in a fold of his ermine mantle
but the little prince be astonish
the planet be tiny
over what could this king really rule
sire he say to him excuse my ask you a question i order you to ask me a question hasten to say the king
sire over what do you rule
over everything say the king with a magnificent simplicity
over everything
the king make a subtle gesture point out his planet the other planet and the star
over all that
ask the little prince
over all that the king answer
for his rule be not only absolute it be also universal
and the star obey you
of course the king say
they obey instantly
i do not tolerate insubordination
such power fill the little prince with wonder
if he have hold it himself he would ve be able to watch not fortyfour but seventytwo or even a hundred or even two hundred sunset on the same day without ever have to move his chair
and a he felt a bit sad a he remember his forsaken little planet he pluck up his courage to ask the king a favour i d like to see a sunset do that for me order the sun to set if i order a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly or to write a tragic drama or to change himself into a sea bird and if the general do not carry out the order receive which one of u would be in the wrong
you say the little prince firmly
exactly
one must ask of each person that which they can give the king go on
authority be base above all on reason
if you order your people to go and throw themselves into the sea they would rise up in revolution
i have the right to demand obedience because my order be reasonable
then my sunset
the little prince remind him who never forget a question once he have ask it
you shall have your sunset
i shall command it
but i shall wait accord to my science of government until condition be favourable
when will that be
inquire the little prince
hum
hum
reply the king who consult a bulky almanac
hum
hum
that will be about about that will be this even about twenty minute to eight
and you will see how well i be obey
the little prince yawn
he be regret his lost sunset
and then he be already get a little bored
i ve nothing more to do here he say to the king
i ll set off
do not go say the king who be very proud of have a subject
do not go
i will make you a minister
minister of what
minster of of justice
but there s nobody here to judge
we do not know that the king say to him
i have not yet make a complete tour of my kingdom
i be very old i have no space for a carriage and it tire me to walk
oh but i ve already look
say the little prince who lean over to give one more glance at the other side of the planet
there be no one there either then you shall judge yourself the king answer
that be the most difficult thing of all
it be much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge someone else
if you succeed in judge yourself rightly then you be truly wise
yes say the little prince but i can judge myself anywhere
i do nt have to live here
hum
hum
say the king
i be fairly certain that somewhere on my planet there be an old rat
i hear him at night
you can judge this old rat
from time to time you will condemn him to death
thus his life will depend on your justice
but you will pardon him on each occasion to conserve him
there be only one of him
i reply the little prince do nt like to condemn anyone to death and now i think i ll go on my way
no say the king
but the little prince have readied himself to leave have no wish to grieve the old monarch
if your majesty wish to be promptly obey he should be able to give me a reasonable order
he should be able for example to order me to leave within a minute
it seem to me that condition be favourable a the king make no answer the little prince hesitate at first then with a sigh take his leave
i make you my ambassador the king hastily call out
he have a magnificent air of authority
the grownup be very strange the little prince say to himself a he continue on his journey
the second planet be inhabit by a conceited man
ah
here come a visit from an admirer
exclaim the conceited man from afar the moment he spot the little prince
because to conceited men all other men be admirer
good morning say the little prince
you have a funny hat
it s for salute the conceited man reply
it s to raise in salute when people acclaim me
unfortunately nobody ever pass by this way
oh really
say the little prince who do nt understand
clap your hand one against the other the conceited man advise
the little prince clap his hand one against the other
the conceited man raise his hat in a modest salute
this be more fun than the visit to the king the little prince say to himself
and he begin again to clap his hand one against the other
the conceited man again raise his hat in a salute
after five minute of this exercise the little prince grow tire of the monotony of the game and what should i do he ask to make the hat come down
but the conceited man do nt hear him
conceited people never hear anything but praise
do you really admire me a lot
he ask the little prince
what do that mean to admire
to admire mean to recognise that i m the most handsome the bestdressed the richest and the most intelligent man on the planet
but you re the only man on your planet
do it for me
admire me just the same
i admire you say the little prince shrug his shoulder a little but how can that interest you so much
and the little prince go away
the grownup be certainly very odd he say to himself a he continue his journey
the next planet be inhabit by a heavy drinker
this be a very short visit but it plunge the little prince into a deep sadness
what be you do there
he say to the drinker who he find sit in silence in front of a number of empty bottle and a number of full bottle
i m drink reply the drinker gloomily
why be you drink
the little prince ask him
to forget reply the drinker
to forget what
ask the little prince who already felt sorry for him
to forget that i m ashamed confess the drinker lower his head
ashamed of what
inquire the little prince who want to help him
ashamed of drinking
conclude the drinker who then shut himself away in the silence
and the little prince go away puzzle
the grownup be certainly very very odd he say to himself a he continue on his journey
the fourth planet belong to a businessman
this man be so busy that he do nt even raise his head when the little prince arrive
good morning the little prince say to him
your cigarette have go out
three and two make five
five and seven make twelve
twelve and three make fifteen
good morning
fifteen and seven make twentytwo
twentytwo and six make twentyeight
no time to light it again
twentysix and five make thirtyone
phew
then that make fivehundredandone million sixhundredtwentytwothousand sevenhundredthirtyone
five hundred million what
huh
be you still there
fivehundredandone million i ve forget now i have so much work
i be a man of consequence
i do nt amuse myself with balderdash
two and five make seven
fivehundredandone million what
repeat the little prince who have never in his life let go of a question once he have ask it
the businessman raise his head
during the fiftyfour year that i ve live on this planet i ve only be disturb three time
the first time be twentytwo year ago by some scatterbrain who fell from god know where
he make the most dreadful noise and i make four mistake in a sum
the second time be eleven year ago by an attack of rheumatism
i do nt get enough exercise
i do nt have time to stroll about
i be a man of consequence
the third time well this be it
i be say then fivehundredandone million million of what
the businessman realise that there be no hope of be leave in peace million of those little object that you see sometimes in the sky
fly
no no the little thing that shine
bee
no no
the little golden thing that make lazy men daydream
a for me i be a man of consequence
i have no time to daydream
ah
the star
yes that s it
the star
and what do you do with fivehundred million star
fivehundredandone million sixhundredtwentytwo thousand sevenhundredthirtyone
i be a man of consequence i be precise
and what do you do with these star
what do i do with them
yes
nothing
i own them
you own the star
yes
but i ve already see a king who kings do nt own they reign over
it s very different
and how do own the star help you
it help by make me rich
and how do be rich help you
to buy more star if someone discover some more
this man the little prince say to himself reason a bit like my poor drinker but he still have some question how can you own the star
who own them
the businessman retort grumpily
i do nt know
nobody do
then they belong to me because i thought of it first
be that all that s necessary
certainly
when you find a diamond that belong to nobody it s yours
when you discover an island that belong to nobody it s yours
when you get an idea first you take out a patent it s yours
and i own the star because no one before me ever think of own them
yes that s true say the little prince
and what do you do with them
i administer them
i count them and recount them say the businessman
it s difficult
but i be a man of consequence
the little prince be still not satisfied
if i own a scarf i could put it around my neck and take it away with me
if i own a flower i could pick my flower and take it away with me
but you ca nt pick the star
no
but i can put them in the bank
what do that mean
that mean that i write the number of my star on a little paper
and then i lock this paper in a draw
and that s all
that s enough
that s funny think the little prince
it s rather poetic
but it s of no great consequence
on matter of consequence the little prince have idea which be very different from those of the grownup
i myself he continue own a flower that i water every day
i own three volcano that i sweep out every week a i also sweep out the one that s extinct
you never know
it s of some use to my volcano and it s of some use to my flower that i own them
but you re of no use to the star the businessman open his mouth but he find nothing to say in response and the little prince go away
the grownup be certainly altogether extraordinary he say to himself a he continue on the journey
the fifth planet be very strange
it be the small of them all
there be just enough room on it to accommodate a street lamp and a lamplighter
the little prince could nt work out the purpose of have a street lamp and a lamplighter somewhere out in the sky on a planet without any house or people
he say to himself nevertheless it may well be that this man be absurd
but he s less absurd than the king than the conceited man the businessman or the drinker
at least his work have some meaning
when he light his lamp it s a if he s bring to life one more star or one more flower
when he put out his lamp he send the flower or the star to sleep
that s a beautiful occupation
it serve a real purpose because it s pretty
when he arrive on the planet he respectfully salute the lamplighter
good morning
why have you just put out your lamp
those be the order reply the lamplighter
good morning
what be the order
that i put out my lamp
good evening
and he light it again
but why have you just light it again
those be the order reply the lamplighter
i do nt understand say the little prince
there s nothing to understand say the lamplighter
order be order
good morning
and he put out his lamp
then he sponge his forehead with a handkerchief decorate with red square
i have a terrible profession
in the old day it be reasonable
i d put the lamp out in the morning and in the evening i d light it
i have the rest of the day to rest and the rest of the night to sleep and since then have the order change
the order have nt change say the lamplighter
that s the tragedy
every year the planet have turn faster and faster and the order have nt change
so what then
say the little prince
so now that it spin round once every minute i no longer have a moment s rest
once every minute i light the lamp and put it out again
that s funny
where you live a day only last a minute
it s not funny at all
say the lamplighter
we ve already be speak for a month
a month
yes
thirty minute
thirty day
good evening
and he light his lamp again
the little prince watch him and felt that he love this lamplighter who be so faithful to his order
he remember the sunset which he himself have go to seek in the past by move his chair
he want to help his friend
you know i know a way you can rest whenever you want i always want to say the lamplighter
for it s possible to be both faithful and lazy at the same time
the little prince go on your planet be so small that you can go right round it in three stride
you only have to walk along rather slowly to always stay in the sun
when you want to rest you can walk and the day will last as long a you like
that do nt do me much good say the lamplighter
what i really love in life be to sleep
that s bad luck say the little prince
that be bad luck say the lamplighter
good morning
and he put out his lamp
that man say the little prince to himself a he continue far on his journey that man would be despise by all the others by the king by the conceited man by the drinker and by the businessman
yet he s the only one that do nt seem ridiculous to me
perhaps it s because he think of something other than himself
he breathe a sigh of regret and say to himself that man be the only one with who i could ve make friend
but his planet be really very small
there s no room on it for two people
what the little prince do nt dare admit to himself be that he miss this bless planet most of all because of the 1440 sunset every day
the sixth planet be ten time large than the last
it be inhabit by an old gentleman who write enormous book
oh look
here come an explorer
he cry out when he catch sight of the little prince
the little prince sit down on the table and pant a little
he have already travel so far
where do you come from
the old gentleman say to him
what s that big book
say the little prince
what do you do here
i be a geographer say the old gentleman
what s a geographer
he be a scholar who know the location of the sea the river the town the mountain and the desert
that s very interesting say the little prince
that really be at last a real profession
and he glance around at the planet of the geographer
he have never see such a majestic planet before
your planet be very beautiful he say
be there ocean
i would nt know say the geographer
oh
lrb the little prince be disappointed rrb
and mountain
i would nt know say the geographer
and town and river and desert
i would nt know that either say the geographer
but you re a geographer
that s true the geographer say but i be not an explorer
i do nt have a single explorer
it be not for the geographer to count the town the river the mountain the sea the ocean and the desert
the geographer be too important to go stroll about
he do nt leave his desk
but he receive the explorer
he ask them question and he write down their recollection
and if any of their recollection seem interest to him the geographer order an inquiry into that explorer s moral character
why s that
because an explorer who tell lie would cause havoc to geography book
so would an explorer who drink too much
why s that
ask the little prince
because intoxicate men see double
so the geographer would record two mountain in a place where there be only one
i know someone say the little prince who d make a bad explorer
that s possible
so when the moral character of the explorer appear to be in order an inquiry be do into his discovery
you go to see it
no
that would be too complicate
but one require the explorer to provide proof
if for example the discovery in question be of a large mountain one would require that he bring back large stone from it
the geographer suddenly become excited
but you you come from far away
you be an explorer
you must describe your planet to me
and the geographer have open his big register sharpen his pencil
the recital of explorer be first record in pencil
one wait until the explorer have provide proof before record them in ink
well
say the geographer
oh where i live say the little prince it s not very interesting everything be very small
i have three volcano
two active volcano and one extinct one
but you never know
one never know say the geographer
i also have a flower
we do not record flower say the geographer
why s that
it s the pretty thing
because flower be ephemeral
what do that mean ephemeral
geography book say the geographer of all book be the most concerned with matter of consequence
they never become outdated
it be very rare that a mountain change position
it be very rare that an ocean empty itself of it water
we write about eternal thing
but extinct volcano can wake up interrupt the little prince
what do ephemeral mean
whether volcano be extinct or active be of no consequence to u say the geographer
the thing that matter to u be the mountain
it do not change
but what do ephemeral mean
repeat the little prince who have never in his life let go of a question once he have ask it
it mean which be at risk of imminent disappearance
be my flower at risk of imminent disappearance
of course
my flower be ephemeral the little prince say to himself and she have only four thorn to defend herself against the world
and i ve leave her all alone on my planet
that be his first moment of regret
but he take heart once again what place would you advise me to visit
he ask
the planet earth reply the geographer
it have a good reputation and the little prince go away think of his flower
so the seventh planet be the earth
the earth be nt just any old planet
it have 111 king lrb not forget of course the negro king amongst them rrb 7000 geographer 900000 businessmen 7500000 heavy drinker 311000000 conceited men that s to say about 2000000000 grownup
to give you an idea of the size of the earth i ll tell you that before the invention of electricity it be necessary to maintain over the span of the six continent a veritable army of 462511 streetlamp lighter
see from a distance it make a wonderful spectacle
the movement of this army be regulate like those of an opera ballet
first come the turn of the lamplighter of new zealand and australia
have set their lamp alight they would go off to bed
next come the turn of the lamplighter of china and siberia to enter into the dance
then they too would disappear into the wing
then come the turn of the lamplighter of russia and the indie
then those of africa and europe
then those of south america
then those of north america
and never would they make a mistake in their order of entry on stage
it be magnificent
only the lamp lighter of the single lamp of the north pole and his colleague at the single lamp of the south pole lead life of leisure they work twice a year
when one want to be witty it can happen that one bend the truth a little
i have nt be entirely honest in tell you about the lamplighter
i run the risk of give a false idea of our planet to those who do nt know it
men take up very little space on the earth
if the two billion people who inhabitant the earth be to stand upright and squash together a little like for a meeting they would easily fit on one public square twenty mile long and twenty mile wide
all humanity could be pile up on the small pacific islet
the grownup of course wo nt believe you
they picture themselves a take up a lot of space
they think themselves as important a the baobab
therefore you should advise them to do the math
they adore number and that will please them
but do nt waste your time on this chore
there s no point
you trust me
the little prince have arrive on earth be very surprised not to see anyone
he have already start to worry that he d get the wrong planet when a mooncoloured coil stir in the sand
good evening say the little prince courteously
good evening say the snake
on what planet have i come down on
ask the little prince
onto earth in africa the snake answer
oh
so there s no one on earth
this be the desert
there be no one in the desert
the earth be large say the snake
the little prince sit down on a stone and raise his eye toward the sky
i wonder he say if the star be light so that each of u can one day find his own again
look at my planet
it s right there above u but it s so far away
it be beautiful say the snake
what have bring you here
i ve be have some trouble with a flower say the little prince
ah
say the snake
and they be silent
where be the men
ask the little prince at last
it s a bit lonely in the desert it be also lonely amongst men the snake say
the little prince gaze at him for a long time
you re a funny animal he say finally as thin a a finger but i be more powerful than the finger of a king say the snake
the little prince smile
you re not very powerful you have nt even get any leg you ca nt even travel i can carry you further than a ship say the snake
he wrap himself around the little prince s ankle like a golden bracelet
whoever i touch i send him back to the earth from which he come he continue
but you be pure and you come from a star the little prince make no reply
i feel sorry for you so weak on this earth make of granite
i can help you if someday you become too homesick for your planet
i can
oh
i understand very well say the little prince but why do you always speak in riddle
i solve them all say the snake
and they be silent
the little prince cross the desert and meet only with one flower
a flower with three petal a nondescript flower belong to no one
good morning say the little prince
good morning say the flower
where be the men
ask the little prince politely
the flower have once see a caravan passing
men
i think there exist six or seven of them
i saw them year ago
but you never know where to find them
they be blow here and there by the wind
they lack root it make thing very difficult for them goodbye say the little prince
goodbye say the flower
chapter xix the little prince climb a high mountain
the only mountains he d ever know be the three volcano that come up to his knee
and he use the extinct volcano a a footstool
from a mountain as high a this one he say to himself i ll be able to see the entire planet all at once and all the people but he saw nothing but sharp needle of rock
good morning he say courteously
good morning good morning good morning answer the echo
who be you
say the little prince
who be you who be you who be you
answer the echo
be my friend
i m all alone he say
i m all alone all alone all alone answer the echo
what a funny planet
he think
it s all dry and all jag and all barren
and the people have no imagination
they repeat whatever you say to them on my planet i have a flower she be always the first to speak
but it happen that the little prince have walk for a long time through the sand rock and snow at last come across a road
and all road lead to the dwelling of men
good morning he say
it be a garden cover in rose
good morning say the rose
the little prince gaze at them
they all look just like his flower
who be you
he ask them stun
we re roses the rose say
oh
say the little prince and he suddenly felt very unhappy
his flower have tell him that she be the only one of her kind in the universe
and here be five thousand of them all alike in one single garden
she d be very upset he say to himself if she saw this she d cough and cough and pretend to die to avoid be laugh at
and i d have to pretend to nurse her back to life to humble myself also because if i do nt she really would allow herself to die then he say to himself i think i be rich with a flower that be one of a kind and all i have be a common rise
that and my three volcano that come up to my knee of one which be perhaps forever extinct that do nt make me a very great prince
and lie in the grass he start to cry
it be then that the fox appear good morning say the fox
good morning respond the little prince politely who then turn around but saw nothing
i m right here the voice say under the apple tree who be you
ask the little prince
you re very pretty
i m a fox the fox say
come and play with me propose the little prince
i m so unhappy
i ca nt play with you say the fox
i m not tame
oh
i m sorry say the little prince
but after some thought he add what do that mean tame
you be nt from here say the fox
what be it that you re look for
i m look for men say the little prince
what do tame mean
men say the fox they have gun and they hunt
it s very bothersome
they also raise chicken
it s their sole interest
be you look for chicken
no say the little prince
i m look for friend
what do tame mean
it s something that s too often forget say the fox
it mean to establish bond
to establish bond
that s right say the fox
to me you re still only a little boy just like a hundred thousand other little boy
and i do nt need you
and you do nt need me either
to you i m only a fox just like a hundred thousand other fox
but if you tame me we ll need each other
to me you ll be unique in the entire world
to you i ll be unique in the entire world i m begin to understand say the little prince
there s a flower i think she s tame me it s possible say the fox
on earth you see all kind of thing
oh but she s not on earth
say the little prince
the fox seem very intrigue on another planet
be there hunter on that planet
no
that s interesting
and chicken
no
nothing s perfect sigh the fox
but the fox come back to his idea
my life be very monotonous
i hunt chicken men hunt me
all the chicken look alike and all the men look alike
so i get a bit bored
but if you tame me it would bring some sunlight into my life
i d come to know a sound of footstep unlike any other
other footstep send me hurry back underground
yours would call me out of my burrow like music
and then look you see the wheat field down there
i do nt eat bread
wheat be of no use to me
the wheat field mean nothing to me
and that s sad
but your hair be the colour of gold
so it ll be wonderful when you ve tame me
the wheat which be golden will remind me of you
and i ll love the sound of the wind blowing through the wheat the fox go silent and gaze at the little prince for a long time
please tame me
he say
i really want to the little prince reply but i do nt have much time
i have friend to discover and many thing to understand
one only understand the thing that one tames say the fox
men no longer have the time to get to know anything
they buy thing ready make in the shop
but a there be nt any shop that sell friend men no longer have any friend
if you want a friend tame me
what should i do
ask the little prince
you have to be very patient reply the fox
first you ll sit down a little way away from me like this in the grass
i ll watch you out of the corner of my eye and you wo nt say anything
word be a source of misunderstanding
but every day you ll be able to sit a little close the next day the little prince come back
it would ve be good to come back at the same time of day say the fox
if you come for example at four oclock in the afternoon from three oclock i d start to feel happy
a the time get nearer i d feel happy and happy
already by four oclock i d be jump about and get restless i d come to learn the price of happiness
but if you come at just any time i d never know at what time my heart should be ready to greet you we must observe the rite
what s a rite
ask the little prince
they be also something too often forget say the fox
they be what make one day different from other day one hour different from other hour
there s a rite for example among my hunter
on thursday they dance with the girl of the village
so thursday be a wonderful day
i can go for a walk as far a the vineyard
if the hunter dance on just any day all the day would be alike and i d never have any rest
so the little prince tame the fox
and when the time to leave drew near oh say the fox i ll cry
it s your fault say the little prince
i never wish you any harm but you want me to tame you i know say the fox
but you re go to cry
say the little prince
i know say the fox
so all this have do you no good at all
it have do me good say the fox because of the colour of the wheat
and then he add go and see the rose again
you ll understand that yours be unique in the entire world
then come back to say goodbye to me and i ll make you a present of a secret
the little prince go away to see the rose again you be nt like my rise at all you be nothing yet he tell them
no one have tame you and you have nt tame anyone
you re like my fox use to be
he be only a fox just like a hundred thousand others
but i ve make him my friend and now he s unique in the entire world
and the rose be very embarrassed
you be beautiful but you be empty he go on
one could not die for you
of course an ordinary passerby would think that my rise looked just like you
but she alone be more important than all of you because it s her that i water because it s her that i put under the glass dome because it s her that i shelter behind the screen because it s for her that i kill the caterpillar lrb except two or three to become butterfly rrb because it s her that i listen to grumble or boast or even sometimes when she say nothing
because she s my rise
and he go back to the fox goodbye he say
goodbye say the fox
here s my secret
it s very simple one only see clearly with the heart
what be essential be invisible to the eye
what be essential be invisible to the eye repeat the little prince so a to remember
it be the time you have waste on your rise that make your rise so important
it be the time i have waste on my rise say the little prince so a to remember
the men have forget this truth say the fox
but you must not forget it
you become forever responsible for that which you have tame
you be responsible for your rise i be responsible for my rise repeat the little prince so a to remember
good morning say the little prince
good morning say the railway switchman
what do you do here
the little prince ask
i sort traveller in pack of a thousand say the switchman
i dispatch the train that carry them sometimes to the right sometimes to the left
and a brilliantly lit express train rumble like thunder shake the switchman s cabin
they really be in a hurry say the little prince
what be it that they re look for
not even the locomotive engineer know that say the switchman
a second brilliantly light express thunder by in the opposite direction
be they back already
ask the little prince
these be nt the same one say the switchman
it s an exchange
be nt they happy where they be
no one be ever happy where they be say the switchman
a third brilliantly light express thunder by
be they chase after the first traveller
ask the little prince
they be nt chasing after anything at all say the switchman
they re asleep in there or if not they re yawn
only the child be squash their nose up against the window
only the child know what they re after say the little prince
they waste their time with a rag doll and it become very important to them and if someone take it away from them they cry they re lucky say the switchman
good morning say the little prince
good morning say the merchant
this be a merchant who sell pill that have be create to quench thirst
you take one pill a week and you no longer feel the need to drink anything
why be you sell those
ask the little prince
it s a big time saver say the merchant
expert have do calculation
you save fiftythree minute per week
and what do i do with the fiftythree minute
you can do anything you like with them myself the little prince say to himself if i have fiftythree minute to spend a i like i d walk very slowly toward a spring of fresh water
we be at the eighth day since my accident in the desert and i d listen to the story of the merchant a i drink the last drop of my water supply
ah i say to the little prince these memory of yours be very charm but i have nt manage to repair my plane yet i have nothing leave to drink and i too would be happy if i could walk slowly towards a spring of fresh water
my friend the fox he say to me
my dear fellow our situation have nothing to do with the fox anymore
why not
because we will die of thirst
he do nt follow my reasoning and he answer me it s nice to have have a friend even if you re about to die
myself i m glad to have have a fox a a friend he never consider the danger i say to myself
he s never be hungry or thirsty
a little sunshine be all he need but he look at me and reply to my thought i m also thirsty
let s look for a well
i make a gesture of weariness it s absurd to look for a well at random in the immensity of the desert
but we start walk anyway
when we have walk for hour in silence night fell and the star begin to come out
i saw them a if in a dream a my thirst have make me feverish
the little prince s word dance in my memory so you re also thirsty
i ask him
but he do nt reply to my question
he say simply water can be good for the heart too i do nt understand his answer but i say nothing
i know good than to press my question
he be tire
he sit down
i sit down beside him
and after a silence he speak again the star be beautiful because of a flower that ca nt be see
i reply that s true
and i look without say anything at the fold of sand in the moonlight
the desert be beautiful the little prince add
and it be true
i have always love the desert
you sit down on a sand dune
you see nothing
you hear nothing
and yet something radiates forth in the silence what make the desert beautiful say the little prince be that somewhere it hide a well i be surprise to suddenly understand this mysterious radiation of the sand
when i be a little boy i live in an old house and legend tell that a treasure be bury there
of course no one have ever be able to find it or perhaps no one have even look for it
but it cast an enchantment over that house
my home be hide a secret in the depth of it heart yes i say to the little prince
whether the house the star or the desert what give them their beauty be something invisible
i m glad he say that you agree with my fox
a the little prince fell asleep i take him in my arm and set out walk again
i felt deeply move
it seem to me that i be carry a very fragile treasure
it even seem to me that there be nothing more fragile on earth
i look in the moonlight at his pale forehead his closed eye his lock of hair that tremble in the wind and i say to myself what i see here be only a shell
that which be most important be invisible a his slightly part lip give way to a halfsmile i continue what i find so deeply move about this little sleeping prince be his devotion to a flower it s the image of a rise that shine in him like the flame of a lamp even when he s sleep
and i come to think of him a even more fragile
one have to look after lamp a gust of wind can put them out and continue to walk i find the well at daybreak
men say the little prince stuff themselves into express train but they do nt know what they re look for
so they rush about and go round in circle and he add it s not worth it the well that we have reach be nt like the other well of the sahara
the well of the sahara be mere hole dug in the sand
this one look like a village well
but there be no village there and i think i be dream
it s strange i say to the little prince everything s be prepare the pulley the bucket and the rope he laugh take the rope and put the pulley to work
and the pulley moan like an old weathervane when there have long be no wind
can you hear that
say the little prince we ve wake up the well and it s sing i do nt want him to tire himself out
let me do it i say it s too heavy for you
i hoist the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it down good and level
the song of the pulley continue in my ear and in the still trembling water i could see the sunlight shimmer
i m thirsty for this water say the little prince
give me some to drink and i know then what he d be look for
i raise the bucket to his lip
he drink his eye close
it be as sweet a some special festival treat
this water be something very different from ordinary nourishment
it be bear of the walk under the star of the song of the pulley of the effort of my arm
it be good for the heart like a present
when i be a little boy the light of the christmas tree the music of the midnight mass the tenderness in the smile produce in a similar way the radiance of the gift that i receive
the men where you live say the little prince grow five thousand rose in a single garden and they do nt find what they re look for in it
they do nt find it i reply
and yet what they re look for could be find in a single rise or in a little water that s true i say
and the little prince add but the eye be blind
you have to search with the heart i have drink the water
i breathe easily
the sand at sunrise be the color of honey
this honey color be also make me feel good
why then do i have to have this sense of grief you have to keep your promise say the little prince softly who have again sit down beside me
what promise
you know a muzzle for my sheep i m responsible for this flower i take my sketch out of my pocket
the little prince saw them and laugh a he say your baobabsthey look a bit like cabbage
oh
and i d be so proud of my baobab
your fox his ear they look a bit like horn and they re too long
and he laugh again
you be nt be fair my little fellow
i do nt know how to draw anything except boa constrictor close and open
oh it ll be all ok he say child understand
so i make a pencil sketch of a muzzle
and i felt a pang in my heart a i give it to him
you have plan that i do nt know about but he do nt respond
he say to me you know my descent to earth tomorrow will be it anniversary
then after a silence he go on i come down very near here
and he blush
and once again without understand why i felt a peculiar sense of sorrow
one question occur to me however so it be nt by chance that the morning i first meet you a week ago you be out walk like that all alone a thousand mile from any inhabited region
you be go back to the place where you land
the little prince blush again
and i add hesitantly perhaps because of the anniversary
the little prince blush once more
he never answer question but when you blush that mean yes do nt it
oh i say to him i m worried but he respond now you must work
you must go back to your engine
i ll wait for you here
come back tomorrow evening
but i be nt reassure
i remember the fox
you run the risk of weep a little if you allow yourself to be tame
there be next to the well the ruin of an old stone wall
when i come back from my work the next evening i saw from a distance my little price sit on top of it his foot hang down
and i hear him say do nt you remember then
he say
this be nt the exact spot
another voice must have answer him because he reply yes yes
it s the right day but this be nt the right place
i continue my walk toward the wall
i still do nt see or hear anyone
yet the little prince reply again that s right
you ll see where my track begin in the sand
you just have to wait there for me
i ll be there tonight i be twenty meter from the wall and i still saw nothing
the little prince speak again after a pause do you have good poison
be you sure you wo nt make me suffer too long
i freeze my heart skip a beat but i still do nt understand
now go away he say i want to come down from here
i then lower my eye to the foot of the wall and i leap up
right there face the little prince be one of those yellow snake that can kill you in thirty second flat
even a i dig around in my pocket to take out my revolver i make a running step back
but at the noise i make the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the die spray of a fountain and in no apparent hurry slip between the stone with a light metallic sound
i reach the wall just in time to catch my little fellow in my arm who be white a snow
what s go on here
why be you talk with snake
i d loosen the golden muffler that he always wear
i d moisten his temple and have him drink
and now i do nt dare ask him anything more
he look at me gravely and put his arm around my neck
i felt his heart beat like the heart of a die bird when shot with a rifle
he say to me i m glad that you ve find what be wrong with your engine
now you ll be able to go back home how do you know
i be just come to tell him that against all odds my work have be successful
he make no answer to my question but he add i m also go back home today then he say sadly it s a lot far it s much more difficult i felt very clearly that something extraordinary be happen
i hold him tightly in my arm like a small child and yet it seem to me that he be plummet down into an abyss and that i could do nothing to restrain him he have a serious look a if lose far away
i have your sheep
and i have the box for the sheep
and i have the muzzle and he smile sadly
i wait a long while
i could feel that he be revive little by little
my little fellow i say to him you re afraid he be afraid of course
but he laugh softly i ll be much more afraid this evening again i felt myself freeze by the sense of something irreparable
and i know that i could nt bear the idea of never hear that laughter again
for me it be like a spring of fresh water in the desert
little fellow i say i want to hear you laugh again
but he say to me tonight it ll be a year
my star will be right above the spot where i come down to earth a year ago little fellow be this all a bad dreamthis business with the snake and the meetingplace and the star
but he do nt answer my question
he say to me that which be important ca nt be see i know it s like with the flower
if you love a flower that s on a star it s sweet to look at the sky at night
all the star be cover with flower i know it s like with the water
the water you give me to drink be like music because of the pulley and the rope you remember it be good
i know
at night you ll look at the star
where i live everything be too small for me to point out to you where my star be
it s well like that
my star will be for you just one of the star
so you ll love to look at all of the star they ll all be your friend
and besides i m go to make you a present he laugh again
ah little fellow dear little fellow
i love to hear that laugh
that s my present
just that
it ll be like with the water what be you try to say
everyone have the same star but they be not the same to everyone
for some who be traveler the star be guide
for others they be nothing but little light
for others who be scholar they be problem
for my businessman they be wealth
but none of these star say anything back
you will have the star a no one else have them what be you try to say
when you look at the sky at night because i ll be live on one of them because i ll be laugh on one of them for you it ll be like all the star be laugh
youonly youwill have star that can laugh
and he laugh again
and when your sorrow be comfort lrb time heals all wound rrb you ll be glad to have know me
you ll always be my friend
you ll want to laugh with me
and sometimes you ll open your window just like that for fun and your friend will be very surprised to see you laugh whilst watch the sky
so you ll tell them yes the star always make me laugh
and they ll think you re crazy
i will have play a dirty trick on you and he laugh again
it ll be a if i d give you instead of star lot and lot of little bell that can laugh and he laugh some more
then he suddenly become serious again tonight you know do nt come
i wo nt leave you
it ll look a if i m suffer it ll look a bit a if i m die
it s like that
do nt come to see that
it s not worth it i wo nt leave you
but he be worried
i m tell you this it s also because of the snake
he must nt bite you snake be mean
they can bite you just for fun i wo nt leave you
but something reassure him it s true that they have no poison leave for a second bite
that night i do nt see him set out
he get away without make a sound
when i manage to catch him up he be walk along determinedly at a brisk pace
he say to me only oh
you come and he take me by the hand
but he be still worry
you ve make a mistake
you ll suffer
it ll look a if i m dead and that wo nt be true i say nothing
you understand
it s too far
i ca nt carry this body with me
it s too heavy
i say nothing
but it ll be like an old abandon shell
there s nothing sad about old shell i say nothing
he get a bit discouraged
but he make one more effort you know it ll be nice
i ll also look at the star
all the star will be well with a rusty pulley
all the star will pour out fresh water for me to drink i say nothing
it ll be so much fun
you ll have five hundred million little bell and i ll have five hundred million spring of fresh water and then he too be silent because he be cry
here s the place
let me go on by myself
and he sit down because he be afraid
he say you knowmy flower i m responsible for her
and she s so weak
and she s so naïve
she have four thorn of no use at all to protect herself against the entire world i sit down too because i be no longer able to stand
he say there that s everything he hesitate a bit and then stand back up
he take one step
i could nt move
there be nothing but a yellow flash close to his ankle
he remain motionless for an instant
he do nt cry out
he fell as gently a a tree fall
there be not even any sound because of the sand
and now of course it s already be six year i have never yet tell this story
the companion who meet me be very happy to see me alive again
i be sad but i tell them it s because i m tire now my sorrow be comfort a little
i mean not entirely
but i do know that he get back to his planet because at daybreak i do nt find his body
it be nt a very heavy body and i love to listen to the star at night
it s just like five hundred million little bell but there be one extraordinary thing
when i draw the muzzle for the little prince i forget to add the leather strap to it
he would never have be able to fasten it to the sheep
so i wonder what happen on his planet
it may well be the sheep ate the flower sometimes i tell myself surely not
the little prince shut his flower under her glass dome every night and he watch over his sheep very carefully then i m happy
and all the star laugh sweetly
other time i tell myself everyone be absentminded at some point and that s all it take
one evening he would ve forget the glass dome or maybe the sheep get out quietly during the night and then the little bell turn to tear herein lie a great mystery
for you who also love the little prince just like for me nothing in the universe be the same if somewhere out there a sheep that we have never see have have it
eat a rise look at the sky
ask yourselves have the sheepyes or noeaten the flower
and you will see how everything change and no grownup will ever understand that this be a matter of such importance
this to me be the most beautiful and most sad landscape in the world
it s the same landscape a the one on the previous page but i have draw it again to show it to you properly
it s here that the little prince appear on earth and then disappear
look at this landscape carefully so a to be sure to recognise it if one day you travel in africa in the desert
and if you happen to pass by there i beg you do nt hurry on wait a while exactly under the star
if a child then come to you if he laugh if he have golden hair if he do nt respond when question you ll easily guess who it be
so think of me
save me from this sorrow write to me quickly to tell me he s back
